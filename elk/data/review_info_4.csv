ASUS,F542UA-DH71,4,Nice Notebook but be thoughtful of 5 ghz wireless connection,2018-06-30,"Pros:Its light, less than 4 lbs. Its fast and boots in less than 10 seconds. Its got a CD/DVD recording drive. Nice screen view and aesthetically designed frame. Also tech support is quick to respond on the phone.","Cons:It's wireless connection is using to the 802.11 AC band,  (5 ghz), which is a newer standard than the  older 2.4 ghz being broadcast on some routers. Some notebooks use a dual band wireless device that would take care of this issue.  It would be a good idea for anyone replacing a notebook that they have been using for many years to check what  band their router is currently broadcasting so they understand if suddenly the new notebook wireless appears to be connecting slowly.One other minor issue was difficulty using the track pad mouse. I would often lose the mouse because of pressure issues. Much easier to use a wired/wireless mouse.","Other Thoughts:After barely being able to connect to the Internet with its internal wireless connector I called Asus tech support. Went through reinstalling the wireless device driver all the way to reinstalling the complete operating system. Nothing helped speed up the connection. Sent the notebook back to Newegg and Newegg speedily sent me a replacement. Had the same difficulty with the 2nd laptop. Again went through tech support with the same results. Finally, just as an experiment, I installed a USB wireless connector that I had on hand. It worked perfectly and I had a good connection. No choppy video and able to move from site to site without a hiccup.Asus support apparently reads reviews on this site and contacted me about the slow connection I was getting. I checked our router and found we were using the 2.4 ghz standard. At that point I realized that there was nothing wrong with their notebook's wireless connector.The only other thought that I keep considering is the  240 Gb M2 chip for storage that comes in this machine. I'm used to using a SSD . It probably should not be an issue, but still I'm slow to change to newer technology.",0,1
ASUS,F542UA-DH71,4,"Laptop is fine, but windows is not",2018-06-24,Pros:Quick at startup and does what is expected,"Cons:Laptop was hard to setup when we received it since the programming wanted our Microsoft.com login. We didn't want one and although there was another setup choice, it still required to us to sign up for one or we couldn't use the machine. Also, windows 10 is not as user friendly as windows 7. The added bloat software that was pre-loaded had to be removed too.",Other Thoughts:Price was good,0,1
ASUS,F542UA-DH71,4,Great Laptop. Lousy Packaging,2018-03-27,"Pros:- Simple set up. Practically does the work for you- Large screen.- Runs quick, stays cool.-Shipped quick- Large touch pad is nice and easy to use.","Cons:- 4 ""eggs"" for the laptop - 1 ""egg"" for the shipping box.- Lightweight keying makes it feel kinda cheap. Not loose or anything, just a weird touch.- HORRIBLE shipping box. The laptop's ""box"" was just thrown into a slightly larger box to ship with no padding; so it slid all around. The outer box was a damaged mess. Half open (the one piece of tape thrown across the seam didn't quite do it's job) and large, accordion-like dents in the outer box.  I was worried the laptop had been damaged. In the end, the laptop seems fine and doesn't have visible issues, but it's honestly making me think twice about going through Newegg again. This laptop is an investment for my business and honestly, the packing job told me they don't really care.",,10,1
ASUS,E203MA-DB02,1,Completely died after just over a year.,2019-03-19,Pros:Small and light.,"Cons:Slow to respond, but I didn't expect a lot from a cheap, tiny laptop, just wanted something small and portable. It was purchased 3/5/2018, and on 3/19/2019, it now fails to start at all. The only sign of life is a little green light next to the lightbulb icon, and an amber light when plugged in.  Otherwise, it's even too small and light to serve as a doorstop.",,0,0
ASUS,E203MA-DB02,4,Great value,2018-09-30,"Pros:I`m using this s a secondary computer, I just wanted something light weight to travel with, and this does everything I need it to. All of the stats  on the computer are good enough so that it doesn`t run slowly, boots quickly, and is overall enjoyable to use. The screen is HD, and the 4gb of RAM is great for a computer this size and this cheap. The build quality is very nice, its light weight but still feels very firm and solid, I don`t worry about it breaking in my backpack when I travel. I like that it has an HDMI port and 2 USB 3.0 ports, so I never have to carry any adapters with me like many Mac users do. The keys are not backlit but they are surprisingly tactile so I don`t mind having to type for long periods of time.","Cons:It doesn`t come with much memory, but it does come with the a 32gb SD which normally you could just use to store files, but if you format it properly you can also store programs and apps that cannot normally be installed on removable storage. Here`s a link that I used to format my SD card that worked well for me. Also, if I could go back I might have just paid $20 to buy a 128gb SD card from the start.http://laptoprepairpro.com/using-sd-card-hard-disk-ultrabooks-2in1-laptops/Also, the track pad isn`t the greatest. Its definitely useable but you may want to buy a wireless mouse if you plan to do extensive work on it.Finally, the sound volume keys are on the opposite side of the keyboard as the ""fn"" key, which needs to be held down to control the volume, so you are forced to use two hands to adjust the volume. There is no ""fn lock"" key on this computer.","Other Thoughts:Overall this is a a great computer, especially for the price. I would recommend this to students, business people who travel (microsoft office runs well on it) , or anyone just looking for a good computer that does the basics and does them well. It`s nothing fancy but its everything you need in a computer and nothing more.",1,0
ASUS,E203MA-DB02,1,Did not come with 32GB SD card,2018-07-31,Pros:nice laptop,Cons:I needed the extra storage space that it did't come with,,0,1
Aorus,15-X9-RT4AD,5,Nice Gaming Laptop,2019-03-15,Pros:-A good looking 144hz 1080p display.-Decent RGB keyboard.-Button on keyboard to change fan speed to two modes.-Cooling system is really nice. Really pulls air through the system cooling it pretty nicely.-Really nice storage options you get two NVMe m.2 slots and one 2.5 slot. Which can give you really nice storage space. Taking apart and installing new storage devices is easy also.-The I7 8750h and Rtx 2070 have nice performance.-The Aorus has a nice look to it.-The 512GB Intel ssd is a nvme m.2 drive with good speeds. It is a Intel 760p Series which has windows on it.-The 1TB hdd is a Seagate Barracuda Pro which is not bad. But I replaced it with a samsung sata 860 evo ssd.,Cons:-Fans get loud at max speed but not much of a con for me.-Rtx 2070 performance is good but not for ray tracing.-Wish display was 1440p than 1080p,Other Thoughts:I have always been a desktop gamer never wanted a gaming laptop due to desktop counterparts being better. But since I plan on going into the navy I needed something more mobile. After looking at a lot of laptops I find the Aorus 15 x9 had the best storage options and performance for a good price. After a day with it I was surprised at the performance of the cpu and gpu both scored higher in 3DMark than my I7-5820k and gtx 980ti at stock speeds on my desktop. I would recommended this laptop if you need something mobile but if you going to play at home more a desktop would be a better offer at the price point.,0,0
Aorus,15-X9-RT4AD,3,Phenomenal laptop with one huge issue,2019-03-12,"Pros:- Great build quality- Great graphics card- OK CPU power, not the fastest 8750H implementation - buy the Legion Y7000 for that- Decent keyboard and trackpad- Decently bright screen- Great lightweight- Small charger","Cons:- LOUD! - There is no Optimus on this even though it has no G-Sync. The integrated graphics card has been disabled. The fan is on constantly, and what's worse... its high piched. No words can describe how frustrating this is. Great laptop brought down to earth by this glaring issue.- Screen colors are way off",,3,0
Aorus,15-X9-RT4AD,5,So far a great setup,2019-02-27,"Pros:- Screen detail and quality are amazing- It's quick (although I'm upgrading from and 4th gen i7 with a Geforce 840m so that's my basis)- Build quality, I'm pleased with the build quality as someone who travels a lot I think it'll hold up for a long time.- Control center is easy to use and makes updating drivers a breeze as well as re configuring the LEDs.",Cons:- Speaker could be better.... Plug in a set of headphones and you'll be blown away from the Nahimic setup though.,,2,0
,,1,Constant problems,2019-02-08,Pros:Ran decently for the first week,Cons:Since we received the item it always started with the bios screen (minor inconvenience) it started by running very slow and freezing and today the laptop completely froze out and is nonresponsive to the power button.,Other Thoughts:Purchased in August of 2018 and it does in February 2019. Find a better laptop.,0,0
,,1,Product is not useable,2018-11-02,Pros:- Cheap- SSD,Cons:- Mousepad frequently stops working- Computer frequently hiccups- Buttons keep getting stuck- Couldn't open edge despite computer literally just booted- RAM and processing is constantly at 30%+ despite not doing anything,Other Thoughts:Bought this laptop for an elderly person in order for that person to stream news and it isn't able to accomplish this function without issues.,0,1
,,5,"Best Metal PC 4G Ram, AWESOME, I bought 4 PCs similar to this one. It is by far the best.",2018-09-12,"Pros:Looks, works, no problem of any kind.

DELL,XPS15-8949sLV,1,Very Dissatisfied,2016-02-23,"Pros:Very fast, when it runs",Cons:extremely unstablepoor support,"Other Thoughts:I am very unimpressed with Dell. Aside from the nightmare of just getting a laptop ordered the quality of the equipment is simply unacceptable. In mid December I received a top of the line XPS 15 w/16Gb of RAM and a 1Tb Pcie SSD. Within a week it had Blue Screen of Death multiple times a day and the screen would randomly ""flash"". After contacting Dell (and of course running several diagnostics with their on-line techs) they said the hard disk was bad and it was on back order until the end of the month. Jan 5th rolled around and they finally sent the hard disk and a technician showed up to install it. After installation it continued crashing and the tech said it would have to be shipped back to Dell. Even though I had the original shipping box I had to wait 2 days for Dell to ship me an empty box! Off it went to Dell where it stayed for 2.5 weeks. They stated that they replaced the main board and the hard disk. When I received it back I booted it up and immediately had screen flashing. I then ran Dell's on-line diagnostics and guess what? More BSODs. At this point I said I want a refund - their answer? Since it was past 30 days no refund. I know that's the policy, but if it spent 4 weeks waiting on parts or in their hands that shouldn't count. I continued to work with their on-line techs, and finally after about 3 video driver updated the screen flashing has stopped, but it still BSODs (and other USB issues). So in the end I have a very expensive brick. Never again will I buy Dell.",10,0
DELL,XPS15-8949sLV,1,Faulty Components- Replaced Twice,2015-12-01,"Pros:I got the laptop for $500, and for the price is acceptable.","Cons:First product came with a faulty track pad. Shipped in for repair and it came back worse than when shipped. Then fought for a new replacement. Finally received a replacement to find new issues. The OS was improperly installed (Dell provided a backup USB for me to fresh install).  The trackpad is substandard- pressure on the back of the case can cause the mouse to click- or stick when clicked. It is better on my second laptop, but still is the worst I've had on a laptop, $200 netbooks included.Worse are two issues that cannot be fixed- the NVIDIA GPU is worthless. When running games, the computer, after time defaults back to the intel processor. This even after extensive troubleshooting. My guess is that the cooling is not sufficient to run the GPU at capacity. Battlefield runs at about 80 fps for about 10 minutes, then drops to 10 when the hardware switches. When on the GPU, the card runs at about 70C mostly idle, which indicates a cooling problem.Also, there is a distinct, high-pitch coil whine that is enough to drive you mad. Dell has known about the issue in the XPS series laptops since at least 2012 (by my research). They have not fixed it.",Other Thoughts:Go elsewhere for a high-end laptop. I'll never buy DELL again after my experience.,5,4
DELL,XPS15-8949sLV,4,"Good product, should be priced lower",2015-11-11,"Pros:Love the touch screen, and with the SSD it is super fast on startup and all. The back-lit keyboard is nice as well. Screen resolution is outstanding, and it runs relatively quiet, even when the fans turn on. The bluetooth makes it so you never need any cables at all. Build quality is good, and the battery lasts awhile depending on what you are doing.","Cons:The Intel video driver stops responding sometime, and the PC locks up; however it recovers fairly quickly, and you carry on your business. Also, I may have a lemon, but my audio port stopped producing audio from the left channel; the right one still works fine. Dell is currently working on fixing it, and they have great customer service. It would also be nice to have  separate microphone/headphone plugs.","Other Thoughts:Overall this is a solid machine, and is pretty reliable. It has its issues, which you wouldn't expect from something so expensive. I would recommend it, just make sure you have a warranty.",0,0
HP,470 G5 (2UA28UT#ABA),2,HP Probook 470 / 450 G5,2018-08-30,Pros:- Some models have fast NVME M.2 / M2 PCIe x4 boot disk- W 10 Pro- Mine came with 16 GB & W 10 Pro 64 Bit- Luckily I knew NewEgg has a nice Return RMA process with NewEgg prepaid shipping label to replace my laptop with delivered broken Lan Gigabit RJ-45 port on motherboard,"Cons:Long-term issue is battery replacement is difficult and time consuming; REQUIRES keyboard removal and is very complex.  See HP service & maintenance manual for HP ProBook 470 / 450 G5.HP only sells 8th Generation 1.8 GHZ 4 core Intel i7.  No 6 core i7 and nothing above 1.8 GHZ manufactured yet in these ProBook 470 / 450 17 inch & 15 inch model(s).  Other more serious issues:1) HP build & test quality has gone down.  Factory recently loaded software had broken W 10 News App.  Would not work with Nvidia Graphics Cardc.  Had to reload MS News App from MS Store2) Laptop had working daughtercard W-Fi 11AC so I was able to connect to MS W 10 Pro updates and also get W10 app re-installed.  But HP laptop mother board had broken Lan Gigabit RJ-45 port on motherboard3) HP web support driver and software site does not allow downloading to a non-HP laptop to rebuild or replace a bad driver via manually carrying the new driver(s) or software to the disabled HP target that is not connected.  It is a Catch-22.  Both Dell & Lenovo support downloading drivers and updated, latest software release from their support website.4) HP Cloud Recovery website is VERY VERY slow.  Took me 11 hours to download 16 GB USB 3.0 recovery drive.5) The HP Live Chat Support is very tenuous.  Queues were even high after 11 pm at night.  HP Live Chat back office went down / offline 4 times in an hour, forcing me to re-queue start over",Other Thoughts:I would wait for other laptop(s) with better build quality and easier user disassembly & replacement.,2,0
HP,470 G5 (2UA28UT#ABA),5,Pleasantly surprised,2018-07-03,"Pros:Fast, solidly built, decent price, and nice screen.

DELL,E6430,1,Frustrating Set-Up Process,2017-08-09,"Pros:The laptop was in very good condition physically, no major dents or scratches.","Cons:The computer had a defect in booting. No matter what I did, I couldn't get past the first couple initial set-up pages. Spent an hour and a half on hold with Joy Systems and their solution was to send me a Windows 10 disc to reinstall Windows 10, but I couldn't even get the computer to start with or without the disc in, so I sent the whole laptop back to be replaced. I'm very frustrated with how long this whole process has taken. It's been 3 weeks since I ordered, and I still don't have a working laptop.",,0,0
DELL,E6430,4,Great Laptop! Fast and easy to use!,2016-12-14,"Pros:I was looking for a laptop for my son (he is 9). I could not afford alien ware gaming laptops, so I needed to find something he could use for that cheaper. This product is amazing. Supposedly its scratch and dent, but it looks brand new to me! And its faster then my  computer. I am half tempted to steal this laptop for myself lol.","Cons:Only downside (it may have been a stock issue) is that mine came with Windows 7.

One was 1066 and one was 1600. This caused the system to revert to the slower speed. Was 8 gb as advertised just different speeds. Changed out the 1066 to 1600 and now it is good to go.

HP,8540P,4,HP Elitebook 8540P,2016-11-07,"Pros:Notebook was packed well. It looked new. I was impressed with teh overall appearance out of the box. Overall, I rate the condition of the exterior at 98%. Only a couple of small skid marks on the bottom of the chassis and the OS sticker gave away it was a refurbished unit.It started up and went through the final setup screens as the OS, WIN 7 64 Professional, was a fresh install. I did have to install the device drivers for the quick launch buttons and the fingerprint reader. Both easily accessible from HP's website. The OS install was from May 2014. So, only a few months of Windows Updates were required.No bloatware was installed on the system. So, I could get right to the work I wanted to do within minutes.","Cons:The battery that came with this unit was completely dead and would not hold a charge. I tried several times get it to work, but it refused. It's disappointing that a ""refurbished"" laptop's battery, an essential part of the unit, was clearly not ""refurbished or checked in any way. I'd rather they shipped the unit without a battery and indicated one needed to be purchased on the product page.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this laptop and planned to upgrade it as soon as it arrived. Once I verified everything was working and the updates were installed, I cloned the drive to a 480GB SSD from Seagate using their software tool. I had very little trouble installing the SSD into the Laptop and it only required a small change of settings in the BIOS to have it up and running. This sped up an already speedy system.This version comes with the I-7 620M, a dual core part, and the memory supported maxes at 8GB. The system board provides two slots for RAM, one under the keyboard and one under the chassis. This unit came with 4GB installed - 2GB in each slot - of Samsung branded 1333Mhz RAM.  I switched these for two HP 641369-001 4GB 1600Mhz PC3-12800 sticks, for a total of 8GB of RAM.I also switched the battery for a cheap aftermarket battery.Everything booted fine the first time - no issues with the upgrades.UPDATE - 11/7/2016 - Everything is still working fine. This thing has handled daily use at work and still keeps pace. Added a docking station and desktop monitor for dual display (along with laptop display), full size keyboard and mouse and couldn't be happier. Very good investment a couple of years ago.",0,0

So far, it has preformed flawlessly.","Cons:It was represented on the website as having a webcam,  which it does NOT.    There are different versions of the 8540p which can differ somewhat in features.   The version number I found on the unit is NU486av which I don't think Newegg provided in their info.

Lenovo,ThinkPad L430,3,"Good, solid laptop for the money",2018-10-07,Pros:Cleanno significant wearruns Fedora and Ubuntu seamlessly,"Cons:Battery is terrible (immediately drops to 75% after charge).  After a few days it won't hold a charge for more than about 15 minutes.  They guarantee 30 minutes and sounds like they'll take it back but cheap new batteries are available from other major on-line retailers.Suggest adding at least 4GB more memory, especially if you plan to keep Windows 10",,0,0
Lenovo,ThinkPad L430,3,Clean Product,2018-10-06,Pros:The machine is clean and set up properly/good price.,Cons:The battery will not take a charge and is completely dead. The difference in the price when I bought it and the price now will be offset by buying a new battery.,,0,0
DELL,E6330,5,Better laptop than expected,2016-08-24,Pros:Very fast and light weight. Wanted a smaller laptop for my son so that it is easier to carry around school. The online description indicated that it was  an Intel Core i5 and after turning it on and checking the specs I found it to be an i7.I am always concerned about purchasing a refurbished computer and if there are any issues how will they be handled. Not to worry in this case. 15 minutes after plugging in the power supply it burnt out. I Emailed JoySystems and they promptly replied that they would be sending out a new power supply and what I needed to do to return the old one. They sent the new one Fedex and I had it installed in a few days.  I would definitely purchase from them again.,Cons:None at this time.,,0,0
DELL,E6330,5,Works Great,2016-08-12,"Pros:Small, lightweight, and fast set-up. No DOA issues. No bloatware!

I haven't traveled with it yet, but it is lighter than my old Macbook pro.",0,0

HP,840 G1,4,Good Value,2019-02-22,"Pros:I upgraded from a barely useable netbook to this refurbished HP laptop to use for basic functions (web, word processing, using as an interface for lab equipment). Had some scratches on the underside but the top side, screen and keyboard were clean. Great extra laptop at a good price - Intel i5 chip, 8MB RAM and SSD make for a quick and responsive basic laptop.","Cons:The screen could be better but at this price, its fine.",,0,0
HP,840 G1,5,Absolutely Fabulous,2019-01-28,"Pros:Almost new looking; small paint chip on lower case, left hand corner. I added 8 GB RAM. Now boots with 16 GB dual channel RAM. Only Win10 Pro was on the SSD. I added many business programs. This notebook on full charge indicates 5.5 hours battery life.","Cons:No real problems, but I did have to go to the HP website to download drivers and the updated BIOS.",Other Thoughts:I would purchase this product again. I recommend that the HP EliteBook 840 G1 and its successors be seriously considered by anyone who wants a business notebook.,0,0
HP,840 G1,1,Power won't turn off,2018-12-24,Pros:Nice look great,"Cons:I bought this product for Gift for my family for Christmas present. it was wrapped and opened christm-as eve, it won't turn on the power at all. Can we return this and get another one",,0,3

Top notch!,"Cons:Was disappointed when the unit arrived with OS X El Capitan instead of OS 10.12 Sierra as indicated in the item description. However, we were able to receive a free upgrade to Sierra; the only problem with that is it took roughly 7 hours to complete this process. Upgrading to Sierra itself took only about 45 minutes however, before the computer would accept the upgrade , it had to go through some type of file encryption process which took several hours to complete.","Other Thoughts:All in all, still a very good deal (5 Eggs), just bummed that it took so long to setup. Will probably upgrade the RAM to 16GB.",2,0
Apple,A1278,4,Grade A Condition - But dont forget that its a 4-5 year old laptop,2017-02-08,"Pros:- Perfect Refurbished Condition- Works as expected- Great display - (Not Retina, but still top notch)- Still has CD rom Drive","Cons:- Battery life is lack luster compared to todays ""newer"" laptops- Hard drive speed is okay - I will eventually swap Hard drive to SSD","Other Thoughts:I would Recommend to others- (Upgrading the hard drive and the battery is still cheaper then the bottom grade newer macbook pro, and outside of the retina display, it will perform with the best of them.",2,1

This was a compromise I made when searching for a laptop as those with an HDMI port were around $1000.,Other Thoughts:Would definitely recommend this. It replaces a seven year old Toshiba Satellite  notebook that had a 128 Gig HDD and was very slow.  This computer cost as much as that one cost new but is much faster and more pwerful.,0,0

Wasn't expecting it to weigh as much as it does, but that's a minor detail and not worth knocking an egg off the review.","Other Thoughts:Was hesitant to purchase a ""refurbished"" laptop, but this thing LOOKS brand new.  Just a few small scuffs on the surface, but I really have to look close to notice them.  With the 16 GBytes of RAM and SSD, this thing takes 18 SECONDS to put up from a powered off state.  18 SECONDS!!!!  Wanted the most memory and an SSD and this laptop fills the bill.

HP,8560W,4,Used HP EliteBook laptop,2015-12-27,"Pros:Quite fast, good quality, reasonably inexpensive, quick startup with it's SSD hard drive, lots of memory, all in all seems to be a good purchase.","Cons:This is a used laptop, the keyboard has had many finger strokes on it, it works fine but looks used. The receptacle for the AC charger is somewhat loose, as it has had much use, it works but the cord will sometimes work it's way out, The AC adapter sent with the computer did not work, a call to Newegg and then to Joy Systems took care of the issue with another adapter being sent to me, quite a long wait on the phone at Joy Systems,maybe an hour or so, but they were very nice and helpful and I received my replacement adapter within a week, a few hoops to jump through, but not unreasonable.","Other Thoughts:All in all this seems to be a good computer, I would not hesitate to buy another used computer from Newegg/Joy Systems. It is a high quality HP EliteBook computer, albeit used and somewhat dated, but great for my needs.",0,1
HP,8560W,5,Not what I ordered,2015-12-04,Pros:*See other,Cons:*See other,Other Thoughts:I am outraged! I ordered this laptop thinking I would get a laptop with an i5 dual core. Instead it came with an i7 quad core. The nerve! It gets worse. I was expecting the AMD FirePro video chipset. But this one came with the Nividia Quadro 2000M. Do you think this is a game?!It was a awesome surprise. Thanks.,2,2
HP,8570P,4,"The fan is LOUD, but overall quality is fine",2016-11-11,Pros:Great and fast performance with an affordable price. The processor is actually 3740M as indicated in another review. Screen resolution is 1920*1080. Installation of OS is simple even for non-professional users. Easy to open the back and replace the battery by simply using the switch. I'm a college student and didn't know much about the old laptop design but I found the calculator physical button very useful...,Cons:There are some stains on the keyboard and between the USB ports. The fan is running all the time and is very noisy compared to new laptops. The track point cap is not firmly built.,Other Thoughts:Please be aware that headphone ports are on the right side since this is mostly built for engineers. There is no fingerprint scanner which is included in the original elitebook 8570p.,0,0
HP,8570P,4,Good deal!,2016-10-09,"Pros:Great performance, I installed Ubuntu Linux as alternate boot, works great with Linux and okay with with Win 7.","Cons:Battery runs down quickly, about an hour. As this is refurb, I.E. used, I'm not surprised or very upset. Unit is also heavy, but as has CD/DVD drive, so larger case, I was aware of this going in, no surprise there. Mouse pad under Windows is flaky, tried adjusting in control panel but didn't help. Will download driver later, maybe fix. Works perfect in Linux.","Other Thoughts:I think the Feature vs Price vs refurb matrix is okay, maybe better than okay. I am willing to deal with a few minor things in exchange for the features and performance at a good price. Each buyer will want to think about their own level of tolerance for imperfection vs cost.",0,0
HP,8570P,5,The features for the price are unbeatable.,2016-07-31,"Pros:The seller did a poor job of listing  what the specs were but here's what i got. i7 3740QM which is a better processor then listed, 16 GB of Memory, 256 GB SSD, 15.6"" HD + screen 1600x900, AMD Radeon HD 7570M Graphics. The laptop comes preloaded with a virgin operating system and a recovery partition. I specifically chose this platform because the laptop is actually made out of metal. It is very sturdy and the MIL spec hinges are awesome. Also the easy open door in the bottom that lets you at the internal hardware is mega awesome. If you like to tinker with the innards this is the laptop for you.","Cons:There were some minor dings and scratches but this is a refurbished laptop. Because the preloaded operating system is virgin, only the windows drivers are included. This means that scowering the 100 or so HP software packages and drivers is required.","Other Thoughts:If you want Bluetooth 4.0 (LE or low energy) for this laptop DO NOT get the built in module. Everyone including HP lists it as a 4.0 something but it is actually Bluetooth version 2.1, really old. To get Bluetooth LE your only options are a dongle or a wireless card that supports it. Another word of caution, not every Half Size PCIe wireless card work in this laptop. Look for cards that are specifically called out as working with HP.",2,0
DELL,E6330,5,Grade B refurished product looks like a Grade A product,2018-02-15,"Pros:1. Fast shipment: ordered it on Sunday, received the shipment on Tuesday2. The Laptop looks like a Grade A product even on the web page it says Grad B refurbished3. Very clean inside/out, while upgrading the RAM, i can see that the CPU Fan very clean no dust at all. Screen and Keyboard look like brand new.4. CPU is powerful to play with 1 or 2 virtual machines, big programs.5. All the ports on the sides of the laptop work, including 2 USB 3.0 ports, really nice.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Hasn't really tested battery yet, but it really doesn't matter.",0,0
DELL,E6330,5,Better than expected,2018-01-24,"Pros:Mine came better than Grade B.  So clean it seemed to be brand new.  Keyboard shows no wear (probably replaced) and screen had no scratches, no bad pixels.  No old stickers, hardly a scratch anywhere.  Comes with an optical drive.  Battery also appears new... it has been holding its charge for over a week now.  BONUS:  Laptop is listed as having an Intel Core i5-3320M 2.60 GHz CPU but mine came with a Core i7-3540M 3.00 GHz CPU. Nice.",Cons:Came with Windows 10.,"Other Thoughts:Right USB port must have been worn out because Joy Systems had plugged it up with what seems to be hot glue.  To compensate, Joy Systems included a 4-port USB hub.  This model does not have a webcam.  That is good because I don't like them.  If it had one, I would have put tape over it.This is going to be my play/experimental laptop.  I removed the memory and HDD and put them in storage in case I need to replace them for warranty service (as per Joy Systems instructions) then installed 2x4 GB mem chips and a new HDD (this does not void the warranty).  I partitioned the HDD in two sections, loaded Windows 7 in the first one and Linux in the second one with absolutely no problems.  Voila:  a dual-boot system.  This laptop will run Windows XP if I decide to install it.  Next, I exchanged the HDD for an old 32 GB SSD and installed Android-x86.  Yes, this machine will run Android OS but without the touchscreen capability (must use a USB mouse with scroll wheel).  Will probably use it as a dual-boot laptop between Windows 7 and Linux, either Ubuntu or Mint.  Haven't yet decided.",1,0
DELL,E6330,4,"Great product, It was easy to set up.",2017-11-23,"Pros:This laptop is fast all the the parts work, i  have not had any issues with it so far","Cons:The exterior of the laptop was beat up, a part of it was broken and put together with glue and also some dents here and there . But then again its a refurbished laptop so expectations were not too high I just wish i had seen all the flaws before buying","Other Thoughts:Outside the exterior of the product, i would highly recommend the product as it works great ! I also had issues with lost shipment initially,  but the saff were very helpful and professional in helping me resolve the issue. I had to make a new order but i was fully refunded for the first one and was compensated with free shipping and the second order was given to me at the same price as my original order.I am overall satisfied with my purchase and the customer service i received!",2,0
HP,8560W,5,Excellent bargain,2016-01-21,"Pros:- Fast- Reliable- While not a gaming rig, it runs my daughters games well.- I've used it to convert some home videos with HandBrake and it blows away all the desktops I currently own (though the best is only a Core2Duo).- My daughter plays games on an attached monitor while browsing the web or watching videos on the laptop screen",Cons:- My only refurb problem has been that one of the plastic battery latch pins is broken so the battery can occasionally fall out when carrying it around.  Easily fixed with a small bit of tape.- Heavier than expected.,Other Thoughts:- I  got a docking station from an off-lease resale company for very cheap. Highly recommended.,0,0

No HDMI, but easily fixed with Displayport to HDMI cable if that is neededEverything worked, did however need to download some drivers for full functionality. drivers for touchpad on/off functionality, Function button drivers, and drivers and software for Biometric scanner.

HP,8560W,4,HP Elitebook 8560 Refurb,2015-09-28,"Pros:Refurb unit - relatively clean, no bad pixels, no dents or major scratches. SSdrive means fast boot/sleep/resume. Records a lot of simultaneous audio tracks with no issues. Overall a good product for the price if it proves reliable for the next few years. So far so good ,  even decent battery life  -  This was  my first refurb purchase.","Cons:LED for audio mute switch remains green, never toggles to orange. If that's the only issue, (and it is so far) I can definitely live with that. Poor and rather unsupported packaging arrived in a scary condition, but PC was unscathed.",Other Thoughts:Exactly the model I had gotten used to for several years with my former employer.

HP,8460P,4,90% Good Clean Refurb with one issue,2018-03-29,Pros:Good Clean Refurb. Scratches and dents were minor.Everything works except for RJ45 - See below,Cons:RJ45 Network Connector Damaged.4 Pins very badly bent.No Network activity - No Lights - indicates network cable unpluggedWireless Network is the only working adapter,Other Thoughts:I guess that is what you get for Grade C.It will perform the function for which it was purchased.Other than the damaged RJ45 - Very SatisfiedThis is the third refurb unit I have purchased of this model.,1,0
DELL,E7240,3,"Body damage is a little rough, but all the parts are right",2018-05-01,"Pros:-It is what it says it is- i7 4600 processor, 16gb ram, 256GB SSD.-It's got a dual band wireless AC adapter (7260), not listed in the specs.-Small, light, fast. Windows 10 Pro validates without a hitch.-Keyboard is really nice.","Cons:-Not a touch screen, 1366x768 resolution-Battery life is looking to be 2-3 hours of gentle use, or 1-2 - 31WH or 2730mAh.-It's definitely a refurbish- physical condition isn't great, B-grade refurbish is pretty appropriate.The last point is my major gripe- The top of the laptop had a neat little body sticker that was hiding some scratches and some penny-sized paint marks (I might be able to scratch/clean that off), and the whole thing smells strongly of spraypaint, particularly when it's running. USB ports are worn (but operable), and the frame's got a few dents and dinks. Between the smell and the wear, I'm a little fearful for its longevity. There's no refurbish grading posted anywhere on this sale page- I guess you can conclude that you get what you pay for, but in contrast to the other reviews, I have to report that I'm disappointed here, and a little woozy from the fumes.","Other Thoughts:Some models of this laptop have a 1080p resolution or touchscreen, it seems, and there's no specification on the store page of which you get here.",0,0

I've received a few refurbs in the past which were in much better condition. I understand it's somewhat hit-or-miss, but here's what I found:- Big ""skin"" on cover and stickers on palm rest, touch pad, and most keyboard keys. I removed all of the stickers / skins as I'd rather see a bit of wear and have the original tactile feel, then the feel of the stickers (they did all remove easily and with no residue). The matte finish over the carbon fiber lid was somehow removed from about 70% of the cover (hence the sticker / skin) - leaving a pretty ugly look. I ended up removing the remaining 30% through a very painstaking process - however, it looks a bit better now and the carbon fiber mesh looks way better than the sticker/skin.- Lid hinges are a bit loose (tried tightening to no avail). If I put the lid to about 3/4 open it will fall back to all the way open.- Crack in the keyboard bezel near the power button (doesn't really affect anything, but I had to tape it down)- rubber lining around the screen is coming loose on one corner - I hope to be able to affix this somehow- screen shows some minor ghosting (can still see faint outline of dialog boxes after they're closed)- dime-sized light spot on screen- 3 areas of grey-ish streaks under the glass- touchpad right and left click buttons are loose - I feel like they're going to pop off at any time","Other Thoughts:-----------Update: after noticing more spots under the glass that were very noticeable with a white background (e.g., Microsoft work docs), as well as some strange behavior when plugging in an HDMI cable, I decided to return the laptop for replacement in hopes that I get a slightly better unit. I was really happy with the e7240 performance-wise, and it was the perfect size / weight, good build, etc., but the spots under the glass were driving me nuts.

I received it and fix it less half cost than Lenovo.","Other Thoughts:I bought 4 Lenovo, 3 ideapad and 1 thinkpad, for my family members in last year. Already 2 laptop had problem. One is SSD and another laptop keypad was broken.",1,1
Lenovo,81EU000GUS,5,All-around great machine,2018-08-18,"Pros:This machine is a great product overall. The build quality is great, even coming from a thinkpad previously. The screen is very sharp at 1440p and has good color accuracy, getting fairly bright at about 310 nits. The keyboard is shallower than my thinkpad, but has the same layout and size and the keystrokes, while they could be a bit deeper, provide really snappy feedback. I love that the laptop has an 8th gen i7 as well as the mx150 at this pricepoint. I was looking for something powerful with a low-mid range gpu, but didn't want to sacrifice display and battery life for a gaming laptop. I use the machine primarily for GIS work in ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, as well as for making prints in Adobe Illustrator. It flies compared to my older T-series thinkpad. The performance is excellent and the laptop remains cool or only warm to the touch even under max load while executing geoprocessing tasks. This brings me to the only qualm I have with the laptop, but is in no way a deal-breaker or even that annoying, the fan noise.","Cons:While I was fairly worried about the fan noise after I had ordered the laptop and then read reviews complaining about the fan noise, it isn't awful. It is noticeable for sure, and the noise is higher pitched than I'm used to, but the laptop remains cool and that is what's important. The fan only comes on into the medium and high speeds while under more significant load than just browsing or anything, so the noise isn't too much of a bother for me.",Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this machine if you can stomach a little bit of fan noise and don't need more that 7ish hours of battery life.,3,1
