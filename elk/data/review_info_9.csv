DELL,i3541-2001BLK,2,No backlit keyboard,2015-04-04,Pros:Very good computer for the price,"Cons:No backlit keyboard and instructions on turning on the backlight. Very disappointed for this, so 2 eggs",,0,9
ASUS,X540YA-DB02,4,Bought for backup to other laptop and got one for grandson to use at school.,2019-02-10,"Pros:Put in 128 gb Micro sd, For the money it;s a good buy.  I know not to expect a lot, but it's good for most users.","Cons:Mostly Win 10,  Most bother Cap Lock  And Number lock don't light when on, comeon how much did you save leaving out two led's, not enough to cover the lack of seeing the mode when typing passwords.","Other Thoughts:I have never got a Asus product that never worked, it's my go to brand, until they fail me.",1,0
,,4,"Great price, beautifully made, lots of features",2019-01-01,Pros:Lots of storageQuick boot timesGreat keyboardBeautiful build qualityStylus,Cons:Lower level graphics cardA bit heavier than some convertiblesAverage battery life,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded to this machine from, an admittedly, old laptop. I installed some minor hardware upgrades on my old laptop to try keeping it current but this machine is a massive step up. The build quality is very nice, although the materials around the keyboard and touchpad are a bit of a fingerprint magnet. The Bang and Olufsen speakers with preloaded B&O EQ software, have good instrumental sound distinction and clear vocal reproduction when playing rock, jazz or classical. Hip-hop fans will need to connect to external speakers for real pleasure, however, as low-end reproduction is not strong enough in that genre. The hybrid SSD/HDD set up works great. The OS is on the 128GB SSD which gives you very fast boot up and application load times and you have an additional 1TB of HDD storage for documents, music, pictures etc. The 8GB of RAM is enough for my current needs but those wanting more power can add it later on. There are 2 DDR4 slots in all, laptop memory prices continue to drop and there are many video tutorials and service manual sources online to help you if you choose to perform the upgrade yourself. I was ambivalent about moving to Windows 10 from Windows 7 but even that was not as painful as I feared. This machine also includes the stylus pen but I have not had a chance to really experiment with it.The battery life is better than my old laptop but not as long as claims made by other manufacturers. I have experienced about 5-6 hours of battery life on a balanced setting doing average tasks (web browsing, Excel, etc.) compared to the 8-9 hours that some manufacturers claim their machines can manage. I doubt those who use their machines for high intensity activities, like heavy gaming off the plug would have enough juice for more than 3 or 4 hours. Speaking of gaming, I don't do it and did not need a machine for it, so these specs were ideal for me. If you are a serious gamer, you probably already know that this isn't really a machine for you. The graphics card is great for running a DVD or basic streaming but I doubt it would provide the response and frame rates a true game aficionado would require. I am unsure how easily someone could upgrade from the Radeon 530 graphics card.Great machine, great price, beautiful fit and finish with good overall balanced performance. I don't hesitate recommending this machine to someone needing a new, versatile, home and office focused machine that can be used like a tablet.",1,0
Lenovo,20HY0000US,5,Love it.,2018-03-21,"Pros:My first Chromebook and am impressed, have had Lenovo products in the past and they have bent over backwards to solve any issues that I have had.","Cons:No back light keyboard, but I knew that before purchasing.",Other Thoughts:A back lit keyboard would be a nice feature to have in the future.,0,0
HP,440 G1 (F2P45UT#ABA),5,Great Notebook,2015-02-06,"Pros:Light weight and good battery life, acceptable graphics for light gaming.",Cons:Wish the screen tilted back a little farther.,"Other Thoughts:Great all around notebook, the i3 4000M is fast enough to handle all of my business programs and the video is acceptable for light gaming if I find the time. Easily goes 5 to 6 hours between charges the way I use it. The 1366 x768 resolution is fine on the 14"" screen.Overall very happy with the purchase.",0,0
Acer,NX.GL4AA.002,3,"Interesting Device, Unreliable",2017-07-03,Pros:- Bright screen- Adequate performances- Compatible with the Play Store (in beta) so it can run Android apps- Can be used as a laptop or an oversized tablet,Cons:- Touchscreen stopped working after 7 months- Large bezel,"Other Thoughts:Acer customer service doesn't know how to help with chromebooks. For example, I was advised to remove the battery to solve the touchscreen issue (the battery is not removable) and then we went through standard Windows troubleshooting (Chromebooks run... Chrome OS!).",2,0
Lenovo,ThinkPad X240,5,Not what I ordered in the best way!,2019-02-14,"Pros:To start off the laptop is in great condition. Only one minor scratch but you have to look hard. Now for the great stuff. It actually had a 256gb SSD, 8gb of ram, 6 cell battery and a smart card reader. For the price I'm annoyed that I've ever bought a new consumer laptop. The Lenovo ultrabook it replaced cost roughly 6x as much and lacked hdmi and smart card reader.",Cons:Not really a con but I'd actually prefer a 3 cell battery because it's flush but I won't complain.,"Other Thoughts:My first ThinkPad, all I can say is Awesome!",0,0
Lenovo,X131E,2,Falsely Advertised,2018-04-02,Pros:-came with 300 gb hard drive instead of 120 gb hd-processor and ram as advertised,"Cons:-Came with the wrong power adapter so computer is essentially useless after opening the box. Not impressed.-Advertised to have windows 10 home installed, when actually has windows 7.","Other Thoughts:if i was given a choice to buy this again, i wouldnt. i purchased this for a customer and now my customer has to wait until i can get the proper power adapterand i have to install windows 10.bunch of extra costs and Not impressed at all.",0,0

HP,6460B,2,Great Laptop...But a few issues with it being a refurb,2017-05-07,Pros:- Runs Fast- Not bad for mid-level gaming,Cons:- Runs hotter than most laptops,"Other Thoughts:As a refurb, I didn't have high expectations. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The first laptop we received, the M key didn't work. Not a big deal. I contacted the company listed and they replaced the laptop. The replacement laptop was only used a handful of times since we got it in January. However, over the last few days, it has been used heavily and we got the dreaded white screen this morning. Not a simple repair if you are lacking the correct tools. Either way, I'm not happy that I have to deal with this in less than 5 months of receiving it. Luckily, I bought the extended warranty and will be contacting them for a repair later today. Overall, this laptop is pretty decent. Just don't be surprised if you get a few lemons before you get a good one.",0,0
HP,6470B,3,Easy to Set Up,2016-10-10,Pros:I like the fact that the product is having activated window and portability of it.,"Cons:what I did not like is that the republishing was not finished well in the product sent to me, five keys on the keyboard where not fixed well they pilled of, the keys are Backspace, enter, shift on the right hand, J and slash key. Also the shift key is not working.",Other Thoughts:I will recommend it but I advise that they  make sure that the do go finishing on their products.,0,0

They're well-designed, rugged, and run reliably. The T430 is not the newest, but it's a delight to use, and the keyboard is especially good for those who do a lot of typing. Highly recommended",0,0

DELL,E6420,5,DELL Laptop Latitude E6420,2016-05-17,Pros:Prompt delivery of the Joy Systems refurbished laptop.

One year warranty a big plus.,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Do not hesitate, great value.",0,0
DELL,E6410,1,Disappointment...,2015-07-15,Pros:None. Got what would have been a great Shell Shocker deal if I'd been shipped a passable unit.,"Cons:Display was broken in a way that would not have been caused during shipping. It was simply ignored during ""refurbishing"".Keyboard was smashed in a corner area, with the result that the 'page-up' key doesn't always register a key stroke.","Other Thoughts:Despite Newegg having a virtually-identical refurbished product in stock (same seller, base model, processor, SSD specs, etc.), I seem to be limited to a product with the very same item number. Very disappointing.",1,0

HP,8470P,5,Another great experience with Atlanta Electronics,2017-09-26,"Pros:I ordered 2 machines around the same time. I had a problem with one of them (which can happen sometimes). I was afraid of getting a hard time from the company. Matt was terrific. We discussed the issue and he told me to send it back (sent me a free shipping label, etc) and he would reimburse or I could choose another laptop. This is the nightmare scenario when buying online... that the company will give you a hard time if you have a problem. Matt couldn't have been better, more thorough or easier to work with. I will be doing more business with him in the future.","Cons:no cons. Everything went smoothly. Thanks, Matt!",Other Thoughts:would definitely recommend!,0,1
Lenovo,T450S,4,Looks good so far,2018-12-03,"Pros:First refurbished laptop I've bought and wasn't sure what to expect for a Grade B, but physical condition is excellent.  Few scuffs here and there but overall very happy.","Cons:Can't comment on the screen or keyboard or if it even turns on yet as it came with the wrong AC Adapter.  It came with this one '42T4430', which doesn't fit the T450s.  Trying to get in touch with Newegg support to get the correct adapter.  If there's a better way to go about this than through live chat, let me know.UPDATE: Newegg directed me to contact ArrowDirect and they shipped me the correct AC Adapter.  All is working well now.","Other Thoughts:I used a ThinkPad around 10 years ago when I did tech support and software training, and it's still my favorite computer.  Hoping this one is just as good.",0,0
DELL,E6420,3,Used laptop,2018-09-14,Pros:worked,"Cons:Battery wore out, low amount of ram  touch pad didn't start working right until I increased the ram.",Other Thoughts:If this is a grade A laptop I would hate to see a class C.,0,0

Lenovo,T440P,5,Refurbished but almost new,2017-12-13,Pros:Simple design that makes a lot of sense. Fast CPU and lots of memory. These laptops are work horses that are perfect for any business.,Cons:The touchpad could use some improvement. I prefer the touchpads on the T420's.,"Other Thoughts:We purchase a lot of used and new products for our business. I find these Lenovo laptops are priced just right for what we need. The T series allows users to use a docking station which is great for mobile users. I also like that fact that these laptops can be completely upgraded without much hassle. Swapping memory, hard drive, or even the cpu is done fairly easy.The seller we purchased from (JoySystems) delivers our products very clean and well packaged. It's hard to tell these are used. Plus they provide a 1 year warranty which is great!",0,0

Lenovo,T540P,5,"SUPERB Laptop.  Everything I needed & more.  Fast, quiet & easy to use.",2018-04-27,"Pros:I had been using a rather lousy laptop for doing recording of Audiobooks.  In the editing process in particular, I would delete 2 seconds & then I would have to wait 10 for the computer to be ready to do anything, resulting in all kinds of time wasted.ZERO lag time on this laptop.2 nights ago we were casting a movie to our tv from my wifes HP.  It was sluggish & kept pausing.  I said ""try mine.""    We had thought it was our internet connection speed.  Nope.  With this laptop casting it, we were able to stream HD with no lag.  Yay!!Also,   I love having a standard size keyboard with 10 key.  Not many laptops that have that.  Not the reason I bought it, in fact I didn't even notice it until after I had clicked order, but I'm glad I got it.Display is nice & a good size.All kinds of ports are great.Still having an optical drive is nice too.And the thing is built like a tank.","Cons:Whose 'brilliant' Idea was it to put the function key where ctrl is on a normal keyboard?  That's been my only frustration with it so far.  I'm a keyboard shortcut kind of guy, but when I click what I think is ctrl-A  and nothing happens, its a letdown.  I've had it for a week and I can't tell you how many times I've hit the wrong key there.  I'm sure I'll get used to it.Also, Battery life is a little lower than I would hope.  I usually will have it plugged in, but it would be nice if it lasted more than just a few hours.aaand... No HDMI port.  I'll live.","Other Thoughts:Don't waste $150-300 on a low end laptop that will start telling you it doesn't have enough memory for updates in 6 months when you can spend just a little more and get this tank.  I'm sold. When we need to get a new laptop for our store in another 3 months, we'll spend a little more & get this or something like it.This is portable & powerful & that's what I needed.",0,0
HP,2560P,1,Poor Quality Control,2016-05-21,"Pros:OK value for the advertised specs, if you can get a working unit.Compact size.","Cons:First unit arrived defective, and would not accept a charge.  Charger was tested and replacement tried, to confirm the issue was the notebook itself.  It was returned for replacement.  Cosmetic condition appeared decent otherwise.Second unit arrived in worse cosmetic condition, and was actually dirty.  Especially disappointing were cheap stickers that were applied to all the keys on keyboard, presumable to ""fix"" ones that had symbols worn out.  Two sticker edges were already peeling up when it arrived to me.  Sticker edges catch on your fingers and already in one day are collecting dust and lint.  Also the ""finger stick"" button in center of keyboard to use for mouse does not work.  In fact it's not even attached, and will fall off if you turn keyboard upside down.I would consider living with the above rather than going through the hassle of yet another product return, except I also fear it has trouble with overheating.  The fan runs continuously, even when idle.  It even increases to high speed occasionally when idle and almost always jumps to high speed during normal use.  The vents are unobstructed and it's currently only 66F degrees in my office.",Other Thoughts:I wish I did not buy this notebook.  I purposely paid a few dollars extra because it was sold by Newegg and not a 3rd party.  I mistakenly thought that might ensure some minimal quality control with refurbished units.,1,0
DELL,E7240,3,Decent Product. A lot of bugs. Still useful.,2017-12-05,Pros:The product works! The computer is fast and turns on at least! The fact that I spent 370 for 16GB was such a steal. I can still do homework and research daily. Or even just listening to music or to browse. I also liked how I received instructions on how to activate Windows 10.,"Cons:However, I've had a lot of problems the moment I turned on the laptop. As soon as I turned it on, the computer wouldn't turn on all the way or go into BIOS for setup. I had to google what to do and take out the hard drive myself. As soon as I fixed that, I had issues connecting to my home network. Luckily, I was able to go to a friend's and the Wi-Fi worked fine. I updated my driver and now my Wi-Fi connects but it won't connect to some other networks. Also, I tried to upload a homework assignment before and the website kept crashing. I don't know if it's the settings the laptop is under or if I'm missing a software program like Microsoft Word, but that in itself aggravated my experience. Also, the sound buttons for the top left corner of the keyboard aren't working and I couldn't find google's answer. Even though this is a refurbished laptop, there shouldn't be this many problems.","Other Thoughts:All in all, I've had a lot of problems with this laptop in less than a week. I mean, I'm glad it still works and I can do homework. It's definitely manageable. But if I had the choice to buy this laptop again, I would not buy again. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend unless they think they can fix all the bugs on their own. But as a naive and immature student with barely any knowledge in computer, it was a slightly aggravating process.",0,0
Lenovo,T540P,5,Fantastic Laptop for the Price,2018-10-19,"Pros:An SSD is absolutely essential for most Windows 10 machines, but especially for a laptop.  This machines 256GB SSD is a reasonable size.  Add given the quality that is inherent in Lenova's Thinkpad line, it is an ideal laptop.  Although this machine was originally designed and sold in 2014, its spec still holds up.  The screen resolution is absolutely amazing with a very advanced graphics card.   It has a ""Thunderbolt"" mini-display port that supports HDMI  The machine I got was definitely ""A Grade"", which is important for a refurbished machine.  Note that although it is listed as not having an optical drive, I actually got one as well as a fingerprint reader.  Just the luck of the draw.","Cons:I've mentioned the graphics card, the high resolution, and HDMI.  I used an adapter to connect to a 4K TV and found that although it definitely produces 4K, the I5 apparently limits streaming at that rate.  Newer Thinkpads have I7 which might be useful for heavy computation, 4K streaming or VR.","Other Thoughts:Although not part of the specification, the machine I originally received had a fingerprint reader.  I determined that it was defective and, remarkably, Joy Systems offered  me a replacement.  I found Joy Systems customer service to be quite responsive for a small company.  I worked with Jorge Escorcia, who helped with the diagnosis and the shipping.  I now have a great laptop with a working fingerprint reader.",1,0
