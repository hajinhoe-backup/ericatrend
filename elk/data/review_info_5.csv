Acer,V3-572PG-767J,5,great laptop,2014-11-14,Pros:Has a nice speedy Core i7 processor.Touchpad and touchscreen work well in Windows 8.1The Nvidia graphics on this are excellent.,"Cons:Lack of the DVD Drive is a small drawback, but I don't use them much anymore and for 30 bucks an external can be had.","Other Thoughts:So far this computer has done pretty much everything I would like it to do.It handles all of my office tasks well and my games on Steam and battlenet look and play well.  The touchscreen actually comes in really handy when working with large spreadsheets. So far I'm very happy with this purchase and I think it will last into the future with the fast i7 processor.you're looking for a moderate gaming computer that can handle all the other real work like office and email and I feel for the money this is a good choice.also, I have had a acer laptops in the past and they have performed well, this is replacing a six year old Acer that was a moderate gaming computer also.",2,0

HP,250 G6 (1NW56UT#ABA),2,don't do it!,2018-06-17,Pros:The CPU is good,"Cons:The screen is not HD, KB is terrible, touchpad is terrible and for win 10 you really need 8 gb  ram.   No SSD?   I have 2 of the cheap HP ""G"" series like this one.  An i3 and i5.... 6th gen.   Both are so bad that I can only use them with a wireless mouse and KB.",Other Thoughts:Garbage.  HP should not even sell junk like this series.,5,6
Apple,MQD32LL/A,5,Awesome product,2019-01-15,"Pros:Sleek, light, and a very fast processor.",Cons:Can't think of any cons.,"Other Thoughts:My son loves it, he uses it in college every day.",0,0
Apple,MQD32LL/A,5,Amazing,2018-04-05,"Pros:I really loved the fast shipping and it came in the original apple box with everything inside. I love how the macbook air looks and works, its super fast. I've only used windows computers until now and with this laptop, it was easy for me to adapt. I recommend the macbook air to students and anybody that wants something simple to work with, it feels so light and my bag is not as heavy as it used to be.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I recommend it to everyone!,1,0
Lenovo,E570 (20H50045US),3,Good and Bad,2018-10-11,Pros:First the good.  This thing is fast!! The Pcie hard drive gets me to the desktop in less than 10 seconds.  The fingerprint reader is a plus as you can log in with just a swipe.  Feels solidly built.,"Cons:By far the biggest con is the color gamut of the screen.  I was totally shocked when i saw it.  Compared to my OLD Dell trulife display this one is simply horrible at 6 bit color. It is HD but I would have passed on this one if there was access to the info on the 6bit color gamut instead of 8 bit. (HUGE difference).  Only other con for me personally is the keyboard.  I cant put my finger on it - no pun intended - but I personally don't like it.  The Fn and Ctrl keys are in reverse position compared to any other keyboard I have used. This can be corrected with the installed Lenovo Vantage software by ""swapping"" those keys.","Other Thoughts:I just use this for my everyday personal use.  There are a few other things that are a very minor annoyance to me but might be fantastic for a traveling business person.  There is nothing that would stop me from 100% recommending this to anyone EXCEPT for the display color rendition.  I have become accustomed to it while using it. However, I get a daily reminder when I use a NORMAL monitor at work.",5,1

Apple,MD231LL/A,5,Awesome little laptop,2012-12-30,"Pros:Lightweight, ~6 hrs battery life, fast.  Great speakers, beautiful display (non-retina display, but I can't tell the difference).  Camera is high resolution and works great in low-light.  Mountain Lion is cool.","Cons:Had some bad stability issues with the video card (froze while playing videos, needed restarting frequently) but most recent system update seems to have fixed this.  SD slot would be better if it was a little bit faster (480 Mbit/s capped) as it is a convenient way to expand storage.  No CD Rom drive or Ethernet port.","Other Thoughts:This computer is awesome for portability, battery life, typing, etc.  I watch Netflix on this all the time, use it for Microsoft Office, but haven't tested out any games yet.  If you are looking for lots of storage, 3D gaming, playing blurays, this is probably not the PC for you.  That said, it is perfect for me.",1,0
Apple,MD231LL/A,5,"Thin, Fast, Light",2012-12-19,"Pros:Ordered this for resale to a customer.  Super fast boot, opens apps very fast.  The SSD and core i5 get all the kudos for that.  This laptop shipped with Mountain Lion OS X 10.8 (NOT 10.7 as in the specs).  YMMV",Cons:None.  It's a great little notebook.,Other Thoughts:It's a tablet on steroids.,0,1
Acer,NX.GNZAA.002,5,Great and fast chromebook for the price,2018-02-09,"Pros:This is the fastest celeron Chromebook at the moment, as it has the Skylake celeron 3855U cpu rather than the slow celeron N. It also has 4GB of RAM. The keyboard is nice, and the touchpad is a good size. It has a built-in rubber bumper which should help with drops. Battery life is great.",Cons:This chromebook is a bit larger and heavier than its predecesor the Acer C740.,Other Thoughts:Recommended!,1,0
Acer,NX.GNZAA.002,1,Not for enterprise customers,2017-10-16,Pros:Chrome OS. Nice Keyboard.  No fingerprints on plastic,"Cons:Thick bezel, poor durability, slow performance for price, price is too expensive, small screen, poor quality issues",Other Thoughts:I do not like this chromebook.  Quality issues with a big price.,0,2
Lenovo,E585 (20KV000YUS),5,Pretty Good for the price tag,2019-02-18,"Pros:The price was very reasonable. Aluminium cover nice. Keyboard feels good. Graphics card works well with Civilization VI at high settings (frame rate low) in Direct X 12, and Shadow of Tomb raider on medium settings of around 45-50 FPS (did drop down to 30fps at times). Video rendering and editing with DaVinci Resolve works well (including fusion) for a  portable editor showing everything a full resolution. rendering a large file sized clip maybe took from 20 seconds to about 2 minutes depending on all the effects, and luts I added. Fusion seemed to work well too. every time I added filter nodes or other nodes, the visual results came clear.  And Pretty much the same for Adobe Premiere. Photoshop works great with this laptop. The screen in Matte format isn't too bad either.","Cons:8GB RAM isn't enough, so I bought two 16gb sticks for a total of 32 GB, and before even turning on the laptop out of the box I installed the ram. The NVM solid state drive is fast and great on battery life, but wish it was larger. I like how there's a slot for additional hard drive - maybe create a larger hybrid between the NVM and cheaper, larger but slower solid state drive - be VERY careful of the ribbon when removing the dummy fake HD in that slot. I had switch the CTRL key with the FN key settings (either in windows or bios) especially for gaming.  I'm still not sure on the USB C connection for power - what happens if I need that connection to add a USB C device? am I not allowed to use AC power? i have seen the docking station and am seriously considering getting that to use both USB C devices and power at the same time. Does not come with internal DVD Blu ray burner, but that's OK as it saves battery life, and really we have to ask ourselves how often we watch media from discs today. If I need to burn anything onto Blu Ray, I'll buy external burner or use my desktop.","Other Thoughts:This is a decent laptop for its price tag. I know there are much better laptops out there for more money, but I feel like I spent my money wisely with this one. 32GB of additional RAM and this laptop and shipping and taxes - when said and done came to total price tag of $719.64",0,1

Lenovo,81DE0025US,4,Computer works well,2019-03-07,"Pros:CheapNice keyboardNice touchpadScreen has adequate brightness for usage in daylight and its contrast could be better, but then again I can't complain at the price I paidNice specs (the i3 8130U is very good, the 6 GB ram is nice, the 1 TB HDD is a cherry on top that will never be fully utilized by me)","Cons:Audio sounds good with adequate bass for a laptop with the Dolby Audio turned on, but isn't as loud as I'd like it to be (If 100% is adequate for me, this would only be around 60% adequate)The HDD isn't completely silent (it makes light scratching sounds)","Other Thoughts:I would have preferred a small SSD (128 GB or so) to the 1 TB HDD for my personal usage, but with so many cheap SSD's prone to failure perhaps it's better this way until the market of cheap SSD's improves",0,0
Lenovo,E480 (20KN003XUS),5,"Solid, fast laptop",2019-03-09,Pros:Sent my daughter to college with this machine and it's been working perfectly for her.

Trackpoint !! for the winSSD1080p IPSUSB charging for interoperabilityMy daughter has experience no problems whatsoever and it's up to the task needed in her science curriculum.,Cons:It's a nit but really wish the USB-C port was Thunderbolt.,"Other Thoughts:While this is not a T series device, it's fairly sturdy.  It might not stand up to true road warrior use but it's not flimsy, either.Would recommend for most users.",0,0
Lenovo,E480 (20KN003XUS),5,Great laptop for home or business,2018-08-05,Pros:Easy to set up and go! Super fast for any everyday computer activities and great for carrying around as it is very light weight. Recommend highly.,Cons:Can't think  of anything so far that I do not like about it.,,0,0
Apple,MR942LL/A,5,Brand New - Good price - Immediate Delivery!!,2019-01-11,Pros:- Good price- Immediate Delivery,"Cons:- Even though this price is relatively good, the Original Price from Apple is too high!",,0,0
Apple,MR942LL/A,5,"Decent, but not perfect",2018-11-28,"Pros:- Great overall build quality- Very high resolution ""True Tone"" Retina IPS-panel Display provides an abundance of workspace real estate, set to highest resolution for even more space with even finer yet still crisp and clear detail- Processing power provided by 6 8th Gen i7 cores and 12 Threads with up to 4.3GHz ""Turbo Boost"" nearly identical to 8th Gen i9 CPUs- Storage: Outstanding speed, incredible read/write speeds and latency- Overall Speed: This thing slices and dices pretty much any and all daily tasks and workloads with ease","Cons:- ""Electrical"" noise, workload specific although most always present under high load (Fan noise seemed acceptable)** A search of this issue revealed many posts with the same complaint, with some users on various forums reporting that Apple says it's not intended, but still present after multiple whole laptop replacements.- Graphical processing power provided by integrated Intel GPU and 'discrete' (dedicated) Radeon 560X mobile provides for an excellent experience in most tasks and workloads (including Minecraft!), yet for a very select few tasks like heavy gaming, leaves something to be desired when compared to NVIDIA 10 Series Mobile GPUs seen in non-Apple laptops. Some 2018 MacBook Pros can be optionally configured with AMD Vega 16 and Vega 20 GPUs instead, which do offer a bit more power.",,1,0
Alienware,AW17R5-7092SLV,5,,2019-03-07,"Pros:- Good value for a speedy laptop- VR ready - I'm happy running an Oculus Rift on it- Alienware is a solid brand with a good track record, unlike some other gaming computers I was considering","Cons:- Heavy, but that's in the specs.  And it's a gaming laptop after all",Other Thoughts:I upgraded by adding a NVME M.2 drive (this one: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820226886 )That was pretty easy and now the computer boots/shuts down in seconds.Make sure you get dongles to convert USB-C back to USB-A if you will need that for an Oculus or other hardware.,0,0

ASUS,UX333FA-DH51,5,Finally a true XPS13 competitor!,2018-12-05,"Pros:I just got mine in hand today and the build quality is just rock solid. This new generation is legitimately nice to hold and it's just so incredibly thin and small without any flex. Unlike a lot of the machines in this class it managed to keep a couple USB3.0 ports, so you aren't forced to carry around a USB-C hub. Similarly, it still has a full sized HDMI port as well. Subjectively speaking, the screen is very nice as well, quite bright and the colors look great. Keyboard is good, not too mushy.Biggest pro? PRICE. This is easily as nice (or more so) as the current gen XPS13, with more useful ports, but does it costing something like $300-400 less for a comparable configuration.","Cons:As for what not to like, most of it will be the same as all 13.3 sized devices. It's not the fastest CPU out there, no dedicated GPU for gaming. Neither of which I especially expect on a device this size. A larger SSD option without such a price hike would have been a nice option, but again, that's a similar pricing scheme to similar devices.Also, a full SD card slot would have been preferred over a micro. If someone needs a dedicated SD card port at all, it's probably going to be to offload a full sized card for DSLR cameras. Not a deal breaker though, just going to switch to using micro cards with an adapter in the camera.",Other Thoughts:This is just an excellent all-rounder non-gaming machine with all the portability you could possibly ask for.,5,2
ASUS,UX331UA-DS71,5,The ZenBook lineup is for anyone that appreciates style and performance,2019-02-20,"Pros:- Light speed performance- Beautiful physical design (when you remove the stickers on the laptop -- it looks 100x more daring and sharp)- Keyboard is moderately quiet and key-travel is perfect (for someone who codes too)- Cooling is 10/10- The weight of the device is stunning. I can pack it with me anywhere, everywhere!!- Small bezels really makes the screen pop.- Battery life is legitimately 7hrs+.",Cons:None at all.,"Other Thoughts:If you'd like to keep your battery life healthy, make sure to never drop under 20% and every day or so charge and discharge between 20% and 90-100%.",0,0
ASUS,UX331UA-DS71,3,Wonderfully fast though hard for me to type on.,2019-01-29,"Pros:-fast, fast. Though I didnt have many files on the computer.-lightweight, instant login via fingerprint.","Cons:- the keyboard felt odd for me too type on and given that I am trying to write a book, it would have been tough. I dont have large hands, but my hands seemed to feel cramped on the computer.- week 3 of the the computer when I hooked it up to the external monitor, there were times when I got a fuzzy screen. while it could have been due to the HDMI cable, my other HP does not do this when plugged in.","Other Thoughts:- would recommend, my hands just felt odd on it.",0,0

,,3,First time buying Dell and it's the Last time.,2018-11-26,Pros:Ryzen5 5 2500U,"Cons:1. This laptop will surprise you with a M.2 supports upto 512GB of Nvme SSD, but only 256GB of SATA M.2, ingenious design.2. For a frequently boosted APU, Dell decided to use single flat copper pipe (not even a heatpipe) with no solid physical contact with the radiator fins, you have literally no airflow. So if you use it without a laptop cooler, you get 90°C all the time, epic design.2. 100Mbps of ehternet port in 2018, why not?3. 802.11 ""AC"" has only 50Mbps when I'm 2m next to my Linksys WRT3200.4. Garbage keyboard, after 4months of light use, the backspace key is already getting soft.5. The BIOS uses an Intel chip, LoL.","Other Thoughts:Do yourself a favor , buy a Lenovo.",5,3

By checking this part number on many other websites, you'll quickly find that this system's MSRP is $1,890 (and most laptops are sold under MSRP).
