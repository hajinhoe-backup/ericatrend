Acer,A315-41-R3RF,4,Great laptop though the copy of Windows 10 is not genuine.,2019-01-17,"Pros:-This laptop hits the sweet spot. Always struggle to get a well working/decent laptop to do what I need to do.It can even do some Photohop/light video editing which is a plus! Light gaming is also good though the lack ofdriver support holds it back from unlocking it's true potential. Thankfully AMD said they will do driver supportsfor laptop this year, 2019.","Cons:-Like I mention, almost no driver support but hopefully that changes soon.-The copy of Windows 10 Home on this laptop is not genuine. I have the ""Activate Windows"" text on the screenthat will not go away even on whatever program I amusing and after going to setting and clicking Activate Windows it says ""We can't activate Windows on this device because you don't have a valid license or product key.""

Acer,SF514-52T-82WQ,5,Good Enough that I bought 2,2019-01-26,Pros:Very lightweight but tough.  The aluminum shell is the real deal and one of the reasons I bought this model.  The system is powerful enough for programming and light gaming.  Construction is generally good...,"Cons:Overall construction is good, I have a slight worry about the hinges, but they've taken a semester's worth of abuse and are still working fine.  The base can get a bit warm...be careful with blocking the air slots.Wish they had a 512GB SSD and Windows 10 Pro as an option.","Other Thoughts:I ended up buying two of these, one for each of my sons to take to college.

Acer,SF514-52T-82WQ,1,good spec for your money,2018-05-15,Pros:it has a nice back light keyboard and it can play run games at decent frames for 10 minutes and crush afterwards.,Cons:unexpected store exception error with blue screen after running for 10 minutes or so with game or web surfing. Re installed Windows and still the same issue. Don't buy this and look for something else,Other Thoughts:Buy it from a more reputable brand,0,4
Acer,SF514-52T-82WQ,5,Perfect for Students,2018-03-31,"Pros:+Performance! Really power efficient CPU. The 8250U paired with an MX150 does wonders in apps like Photoshop and Illustrator. Battery is pretty good. I used this thing for a week and I was able to get 7-8 hours of juice while doing mostly day-to-day tasks, like word processing, web-browsing, and video playback. (More on Gaming later)+SSD! Computer is snappy as hell. Good boot and loading times. Even Adobe apps will load within seconds. Always expandable if needed.+Build quality! All aluminum build with a brushed finish. Potential scratches will hardly be noticeable compared to a Macbook. The laptop is sturdy as hell and you won't find any flex on the keyboard or display.+I/O! Great selection of ports (for me at least). Plenty of USB ports, plus a USB-C and HDMI port-- something you hardy find in most modern ultrabooks.+Weight! This thing is light. Not Dell XPS or Macbook-light, but light. Great for carrying around to work or school.+Keyboard and Trackpad! A pretty tactile keyboard for a laptop. I really like the backlight feature which is perfect for me since I'm a night-owl and like work in the dark. It should be noted that the keyboard backlight will turn off after a few seconds of inactivity but will light up again when in use. Trackpad is good as well. Pretty accurate tracking but doesn't compare to Apple's trackpad. You still get a few gestures like switching windows and scrolling.+Fingerprint reader! Always nice to see a bio-metric security system in computers. At first, it'll take a few tries to unlock your computer since it's a little different from the ones you find on today's cellphones. But once you get used to it after a few days, you can unlock your computer without any hiccups.","Cons:-Display. Not really a con for me nor is it worth deducting a star, but something worth noting. While the display has a glass panel (something I personally like; has a more premium aesthetic), you will see a little bit of bleeding around the edges whenever you're on a black screen, like whenever you boot up the computer and see the Acer logo. However, once it's under normal use, you won't see it at all.-Bloatware............... Annoying. I know. But again, not really worth deducting from since you'd have to uninstall them once when you first get the computer.","Other Thoughts:*Gaming. Personally, I have my own dedicated desktop for this kind of stuff, so AAA titles aren't a priority. However it's nice getting a few light games here and there. eSports games are playable at 1080p/60fps. League of Legends and CS:GO play just fine if you turn down the settings. However, the fans will go off a bit and the laptop might get a little warm. Games like Gwent and Hearthstone will play better even when you max out the settings. Light emulation (GBA, SNES, etc.) and indie games is where the MX150 shines. Cuphead, Stardew Valley, and Hollow Knight will play perfectly without warming up the laptop. I would avoid games like The Witcher 3, GTAV, and other games of that caliber.*Value and Final Thoughts. I got this computer when it was on sale for $650. And I can say with 100 confidence that it was worth it. As a college student, this laptop had everything I needed: a powerful, yet efficient CPU, an SSD, FHD display, and most importantly, a light and durable build. Yes, you probably find a laptop with a GTX 1050 for around the same price, but that thing would probably be big & heavy, and I can't be having that if I'm walking from class to class all day. For a computer that's pretty thin and light, it packs quite a punch in performance. Aside from the listed cons, I personally think the Acer Swift 3 is perfect for students and could go head to head with a Macbook Pro given its price point. If you're on a budget and looking for a snappy ultrabook with great price-to-performance, pull the trigger on this one.",6,0
Acer,SF514-52T-82WQ,5,"Great for price, could be better in a couple areas",2017-12-12,"Pros:Perfect combo of CPU+GPU. With this setup (i5-8250U and MX150) I can play most games on medium or low settings. Honestly, I was not getting this laptop for gaming but the fact that it is CAPABLE of some light gaming is really impressive at this price point in such a small package.I removed the back panel and found the following:1. There are 2 (yes, two!) M.2 slots. One is in use, with an Intel SSD 600 Series NVMe solid state drive, and the other is free/open. You can add a 2nd M.2 SSD to this laptop if you want!2. The power port is replaceable, and is not soldered directly to the motherboard. Meaning if you break the power/charge port you can have it replaced without needing to replace the motherboard or try soldering anything.During heavy CPU use I have seen the i5 processor go up to 3.3GHz in turbo mode, which is very impressive compared to the base clock rate of only 1.6GHz! This is more of an Intel accomplishment rather than an Acer thing, but still worth mentioning.WiFi signal strength was pretty good, and got better signal than my old laptop. Where I was previously getting 4 bars on my old laptop I would get 5 bars (full signal) on this one.Trackpad is decent, nothing special to write home about, definitely better than some of the cheaper laptops than I've seen.Whole unit feels fairly sturdy, the metal top is nice, and the plastic bottom does not feel flimsy. Only gripe i have is the screen bezel sits just a millimeter further back from the edge as the bottom, so it makes it difficult to grab and open. I have to use my fingernail to slide in and open the laptop.","Cons:Screen Bleed! On darker images, or when the screen is black you can clearly see some light bleed on the edges of the screen. Doesn't look pretty.The ""Power"" button is exactly where the Backspace/Delete key is normally located on most laptop keyboards! Hitting this button can be a real pain when you intended to hit delete instead of POWER.TONS OF BLOATWARE! The very first thing I did was create a Windows 10 bootable USB drive (using the free Microsoft media creation tool) and I wiped and reinstalled Windows 10 on this laptop to get rid of all bloatware and junk. It feels much more responsive and functional without all the junk and I highly recommend doing this. In addition, this allows you to delete the space-wasting OEM disk partitions and use your whole disk.","Other Thoughts:The included Intel 600 Series SSD achieves a maximum of 722MB/s and an average of 541MB/s read speed according to HD Tune. Pretty good for an OEM disk! The Samsung Evo series can do better however, so I may upgrade to a Samsung 960 EVO NVMe Solid State drive, and move the OEM disk over to that secondary port for storage. We'll See.",6,0
Acer,SF514-52T-82WQ,2,Basically DOA,2017-11-25,"Pros:lightweight, quiet",Cons:won't turn on,"Other Thoughts:I want to love this computer. Unfortunately after spending 20 minutes or so setting up Windows 10, the machine shut itself off with no warning. It won't turn back on. I now have to send it in to acer for repair. My brand new machine that arrived this morning needs to be repaired. Talk about disappointing.",1,5
Acer,SF514-52T-82WQ,5,"Impressive, sleek, low power consumption laptop",2017-11-02,"Pros:- Beautiful IPS panel- VERY fast Intel 600p NVMe drive included- Nice large touchpad- Long battery life- Solid build quality- Latest gen i5 CPU & MX150 dGPU- Good keyboard w/ numpad- Keyboard backlight turns itself on when you use it, and automatically off when you're not. No software/drivers required for this, it's in the hardware.- Low power consumption- 15.6 inches. Yes, this deserves it's own 'pro' bullet as most low power consumption laptops are 13 or 14 inches.","Cons:- 8GB of soldered, non-upgradeable RAM- Has a USB 2.0 port- No mini-DisplayPort, only HDMI- The power button is an actual button on the keyboard, where Numpad Minus would be on a standard desktop keyboard. I have yet to accidentally hit it, but I can see how this could become annoying.","Other Thoughts:I bought this due to it's low power consumption, which is great for when I'm traveling. Because it comes with a latest gen i5 CPU & MX150 dGPU, you have the option of undervolting both via software to lower power consumption even further and improve performance. If you want to play the latest and greatest AAA games at max settings 100% smoothly, don't buy this.On AC power, while idling on the desktop with WiFi on, it hovers around 6W. Watching a 720p60 Twitch stream hovers around 10W. Playing any moderate to high graphically demanding video game at 1080p has it generally bouncing between 40-43W, with occasional jumps into the low 50s when the CPU activates Turbo Boost. If you choose, you can change the CPU's turbo boost settings via software to reduce or eliminate this. These were measured with a Kill-A-Watt.Cinebench: https://i.imgur.com/grixw7W.jpgCrystalDiskMark: https://i.imgur.com/jMI83Mg.jpg",11,0
ASUS,D550CA-BH21,5,Mommy need a laptop,2015-10-22,"Pros:My mommy needed something to play solitaire on, it plays solitaire great",Cons:My mommy thinks all new technology gadgets is voice activated and yells at the laptop constantly telling it what to do. The laptop continiously rebels and refuses to do what my mommy said. The laptop was not very durable when mommy punished it for not listening and we needed to buy her a new one.,,0,1
ASUS,D550CA-BH21,2,fail,2014-06-16,Pros:CheapASUS has decent customer service,"Cons:I bought three for my kids for Christmas 2013 to use for school assignments, on-line games, and mine craft.  After less than 6 months, one of the computers experienced a hard drive failure and two days after that, another one's internal battery died and refused to charge.Windows 8 slows the system to where it isn't even fun for the kids to use and since two of the three stopped working right before the school year ended, we had to share my work computer for completing on-line assignments.","Other Thoughts:I would not recommend this ASUS product;  hover, I am impressed with how quickly ASUS support repaired and returned the systems.",2,0
ASUS,D550CA-BH21,5,Great Buy!,2014-01-11,"Pros:This laptop is a great buy for the price. The laptop runs very smooth, not a lot of bloatware pre-installed.  I am not seeing what the other users are saying about the cheap feel of the laptop.  This laptop looks nice, has a responsive track pad, and nice keyboard.  The screen is bright and is exactly what you would expect for a laptop at this price point.We are a local computer repair and consulting business. We have purchased 2 of these laptops for customers that are replacing windows xp machines and they have been very happy with them.We have purchased quite a few ASUS laptops and have been happy with all of them.",Cons:The only possible con with this laptop is that it only has 2 USB ports. But this is indicated in the technical specs for the item.,,2,0
ASUS,D550CA-BH21,3,Annoyed,2014-01-03,Pros:Don't get me wrong there is a lot to like about this laptop.The first and most obvious is the utility you can get from this low price. In theory you look at 350 and see these specs and you tell yourself oh that's not bad. I bought this for my old man hoping to get him to expand his knowledge on computers and so far its fine for him. The computer is light and runs fast enough for your average user. I would never buy this but it you're looking to buy this for someone starting with computers it's not a terrible choice.,"Cons:Sadly, there are far more cons than pros. It's cheap so most of these are to be expected. It really does feel like it's made from really cheap lightweight plastic. I'm pretty sure it will break if i drop it. What bugs me the most is how cheap the keyboard feels. I'm use to high end mechanical keyboards so it's safe to say im exaggerating but regardless even compared to my own personal laptops keyboard this thing is junk. The A key wont actually register unless you give it a harder push than the rest of the keys. Just think of how annoying that could be on someone trying to type out a long e-mail or even writing an essay. It comes with Windows 8 which i could not hate more. Seriously Microsoft i really hate you right now. But again, that's more of a personal choice and has nothing to do with the laptop. The touchpaid failed me already. I have no idea why but the scroll function gave out... I'm trying to simply re-install the driver but when i do windows 8 says i can't without uninstalling the old one and since windows 8 is terrible i'm having a harder time then i should be.",Other Thoughts:just spend an extra 100 or 200 and buy a nicer computer if you can.

ASUS,D550CA-BH21,1,Disappointed,2013-12-23,"Pros:It's simple, almost Spartan. All black.","Cons:Slow, No upgrade available for ram or HD without complete dis assembly. No HD light  (so I can't tell if W8 is frozen, updating or just loading unnecessary garbage), It feels cheap, and i don't even mind it, but the CPU and HD are so slow that it makes the experience unbearable. I own a 7 year old Dual core laptop that's faster.","Other Thoughts:As a long time Asus and Newegg customer, This is the last straw.Asus, this kind of laptop will push everyone to buy a Chrome book. Windows 8 should have NEVER be on this equipment. It's slow and bloated.Newegg: I have received 3 bad products in a row from you.

ASUS,D550CA-BH21,4,Decent Entry Level Laptop with great warranty!,2013-12-08,"Pros:This laptop stays pretty cool, has an adequate amount of features, and has a great accidental 1 year warranty. The 320gb hard drive is decent for entry level and 4GB of ram is also a good starting point for Windows 8. Asus is a well established company and usually come with great performance for price. The Pentium 2117U is no performance processor but gets everyday tasks done well.","Cons:More performance can be found by other manufacturer's laptops at the current price,  The video is decent for movies, but will not play most games  (even if your just looking to dip your toes in the water). The laptop could come with more than two USB ports. Two is sub-standard, three is the average.","Other Thoughts:This laptop is a good deal at the price with a great warranty, Lenovo seems to have a better laptop out at a lower price currently. Keep your eyes open on deals. Its hard to beat the 1yr. accidental warranty that Asus puts out with some of their laptops.",0,0

Internet Explorer almost opened, but the whole system crashed. I had hoped to take it home to remove McAffee and other bloatware to make it be able to do something, but all I get is a black screen now after it attempted to update Windows 8.

It is very, very slow until you remove all the extra garbage that comes pre-installed on all Lenovo consumer level products. Remove McAfee security software FIRST, then proceed with the other unnecessary items. McAfee hogs about 70% of this system's meager resources.

The Keyboard is nice. Feels Very Solid. The sound us Great for a laptop. Very Solid and good volume with the Dolby. Also the fact it has an AMD Graphics processor instead of Intel means it will play some games. Mostly older but will Play CoD4 at high. Most cheap laptops with an intel won't.

Was set-up and running within 20 minutes. Windows 8 takes getting used to. Loving the HDMI hook-up. All around great laptop so far.",Cons:I really have no major complaints.

Lenovo,G505 (59371430),3,Okay,2013-06-18,Pros:Cheap,Cons:Kinda flimsy,"Other Thoughts:Bought a few of these laptops for a business.  They come with Windows 8 installed, so I need to turn UEFI off and then install Windows 7.  Unfortunately, this model, the G505 is not even listed on Lenovo's website.

Thus far professional customer service during all our attempts to get a decent unit.","Cons:This is our 3rd try to get a decent unit. This has nothing to do with dents, scuffs or scratches. The 1st unit came filled with pet hair inside and out, shutting down on its own. The 2nd one came without a battery.

HP,840 G1,1,BUYER BEWARE - THIS IS A SCAM. THEY SHIP YOU JUNK,2018-10-18,Pros:Did not receive a complete laptop so I cannot give any cons.,"Cons:Needed this laptop for a very specific purpose. Paid extra for shipping. Laptop arrived on time. BUT was missing the battery and had no operating system. I called Newegg and they said they would do an RMA, which would take a week. Also Newegg claimed it was not qualified for advanced replacement, meaning I had to send the junk laptop back before I get the replacement. This did not work for me, I would have used the junk laptop without a battery and load Windows 7 on it (It has a sticker for that) and would have been able to complete the project i needed it for. Newegg should have shipped me out the replacement, then I can ship out the junk for them. This was so disappointing. I hate that I paid extra for shipping and feel so conned by this whole experience.","Other Thoughts:I have been a customer of newegg's since 2011. I try to give them as much business as possible. However, with this experience there is no longer an intensive on my part to do that. There are other places, one of them honors the service by sending me out the replacement before I have to worry about what to do with the defective.",2,5

There are incredibly deep gouges in the lid ludicrously covered by a cheap plastic sticker. I surmise that someone wanted to try burning magnesium and gouged a pile of shavings from the lid.The keyboard is a mess, too. It must be truly worn to pieces as there are more cheap stickers crookedly covering many of the keys and touchpad.I want a refund.

HP,745 G2,3,Refurbisher of mine was a problem,2018-10-06,"Pros:Great hardware despite minor battery issuesIncredible cost/quality ratio for hardwarearrived in no time, as usualWindows 10 Pro is significantly better than Home","Cons:Would like to know who ""refurbished"" this thing. Came loaded with malware and a compromised bios. While these were relatively easy to fix, it was quite time consuming.Needed quite a bit of physical cleaning, as well. Keyboard, screen, and touchpad were particularly dirty. Strange, greasy fingerprint marks obscured a few keys, but Lysol wipes got things looking right again -note: do NOT use any kind of heavy-duty disinfectant wipe on any screen! That should be obvious, but there's a first time for everything.Battery currently works but has intermittent issues charging and reporting its status to Windows 10Refurbished License key partially obscured by another sticker. impossible to determine its legitimacy and will never be able to re-enter it on this machine","Other Thoughts:Even assuming I will need a replacement battery sometime soon -about $35usd at various places- this remains an extremely good deal if you are willing to put in a little effort. I doubt all of these came from my refurbisher, as no other security complaints were in the reviews at time of my purchase. Even so, the steps I used to fix mine are easy to find online and fairly easy to follow, just a little time-consuming.Basically, it is a good idea to update/replace the bios and reload the os on any used computer you buy, and we simply are going to have to start treating every computer we buy now as used, regardless of its condition or where we bought it. The modern security environment renders anything short of that as simple negligence.Bottom line: 5 eggs for hardware quality and -2 eggs for bad behavior of the outfit that refurbished mine.

They told me that I would have to pay to have it shipped to a service center where they would determine whether the problem was covered under warranty.  If it was, they would repair it within a week--if they had the parts available, without parts available, it would be longer.  He was clearly trying to dissuade me from pursuing that route.  But, they said, New Egg might exchange it for me, so they suggested I try that route first.  I was not impressed and told them that seemed like bad form.  The service rep told me that if New Egg was unable to make the exchange, then he might be able to get authorization to pay for shipping both ways, but that I'd need to call back to see if he could do that.

ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,Great Work Laptop with Decent Gaming Capabilities,2019-01-26,"Pros:This is a medium-large, very thin laptop with a very bright, clear 1920*1080 IPS display, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB NVMe PCIe SSD, Core i7-8565U CPU, and nVidia GTX 1050 Max-Q GPU.The screen and keyboard are the best I've seen on a laptop--the bezel on the screen is very thin, looks like maybe 1/4 inch, and the keyboard has a real numeric keypad on the right side, which is wonderful for typists.For work, productivity, web browsing, and pretty much all routine tasks, this laptop is blazing fast.You can play games on it, but it's not a gaming laptop and its GPU is not the equal of its CPU or SSD.  I tested with the 2016 reboot of DOOM. On OpenGL using all Ultra settings, the game is not really playable, with framerates dropping as low as 15 fps.  All High settings raises that to 25-30, but only on Medium does the game become fluid enough to play well, with framerates in the 45-60 range. Switching to Vulkan only works for the High and below presets, as the 2 GB video RAM isn't enough for Ultra quality.  On both High and Medium quality, framerates are basically the same as with OpenGL.  Note that again, because of the 2 GB video RAM, when using Vulkan,  you have to exit the game and run it again every time you change the quality setting in Vulkan mode.The audio quality on this laptop is good.  with decent volume.  The sound is clear.  At high volume, treble response overwhelms vocal and bass range; the balance is much improved, though still of course weak on the bass side, if you pull the volume down to 50% - 75%.Battery life is very good for a laptop this thin, looks like for browsing and productivity you could have six hours or more.  Do a lot of gaming and that number comes down considerably, my testing indicates three to four hours with heavy gaming.  Still, not bad, as this is almost triple the battery life that my work-provided laptop offers.The display quality is amazing, bright and clear and without much dimming or color shift when viewed from an angle.

I'm glad asus added this feature to this laptop.-ScreenThis screen has amazing clarity, definitely the best i have seen on a laptop.Even includes a micro-fiber cloth for cleaning the finger prints on the screenand lid. Yes this whole laptop is a finger print magnet.-BatteryBetter than most laptops this size from 2018 and prior. Batteries have come a long way.-Power cordIt may sound weird but I really like this square black charging block. Very compact, Unlikethe older ones I remember.-BloatwareHonestly there was more bloatware installed by default from Microsoft than ASUS.I think all I un-installed was ASUS sync and the dropbox app that works with it.And of course all the Microsoft games that that app store pre-installs.-BiosThe Bios is no frills, But it is full UEFI. And you can boot BOOTX64.EFI from a USB devicefrom the setup menu. There is no fan controls, or anything else interesting to tweak in the bios.it is definitely bare bones on options.

Most of these devices can just be USB add-onsless open ports for things to get stuck in, or gunked up.-CaseYes it's a basic case, or laptop pillow case. But who cares it comes with it.

ASUS,UX533FD-NS76,5,Great Work Laptop with Decent Gaming Capabilities,2019-01-26,"Pros:This is a medium-large, very thin laptop with a very bright, clear 1920*1080 IPS display, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB NVMe PCIe SSD, Core i7-8565U CPU, and nVidia GTX 1050 Max-Q GPU.The screen and keyboard are the best I've seen on a laptop--the bezel on the screen is very thin, looks like maybe 1/4 inch, and the keyboard has a real numeric keypad on the right side, which is wonderful for typists.For work, productivity, web browsing, and pretty much all routine tasks, this laptop is blazing fast.You can play games on it, but it's not a gaming laptop and its GPU is not the equal of its CPU or SSD.  I tested with the 2016 reboot of DOOM. On OpenGL using all Ultra settings, the game is not really playable, with framerates dropping as low as 15 fps.  All High settings raises that to 25-30, but only on Medium does the game become fluid enough to play well, with framerates in the 45-60 range. Switching to Vulkan only works for the High and below presets, as the 2 GB video RAM isn't enough for Ultra quality.  On both High and Medium quality, framerates are basically the same as with OpenGL.  Note that again, because of the 2 GB video RAM, when using Vulkan,  you have to exit the game and run it again every time you change the quality setting in Vulkan mode.The audio quality on this laptop is good.  with decent volume.  The sound is clear.  At high volume, treble response overwhelms vocal and bass range; the balance is much improved, though still of course weak on the bass side, if you pull the volume down to 50% - 75%.Battery life is very good for a laptop this thin, looks like for browsing and productivity you could have six hours or more.  Do a lot of gaming and that number comes down considerably, my testing indicates three to four hours with heavy gaming.  Still, not bad, as this is almost triple the battery life that my work-provided laptop offers.The display quality is amazing, bright and clear and without much dimming or color shift when viewed from an angle.  There are no stuck or dead pixels on the laptop display.Connectivity is good, with a MicroSD card reader, a SUB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C / DisplayPort combo port, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (USB 2 compatible), and an HDMI port, giving you two options for connecting external video.  Power and charge indicator lights are available on the right side beside the card reader.

NewEgg's customer service is lacking",2018-12-17,Pros:- This is great for your basic user who wants something more than some random DELL or HP with bloatware. ASUS and Newegg obviously do their best to avoid bloatware.,"Cons:- This product was quite disappointing, NewEgg's website WAS NOT CLEAR ON  THE HARD DRIVE RPM, and with many other listings as I'm looking at what I would like to get, aren't specific enough about items like, oh, is this 64-bit, or is this such a good price because its' home 32-bit windows. Oh, you lowered the RAM, hoping no one would notice, etc. etc. There are things that were advertised that were not present on my computer once received - I checked the specs, their on there. They are waiting for the type of people who do not notice such things (which is most of the population; even I barely know but luckily have very smart friends with degrees related). It was pretty sketch how things were handled; return required huge admin fees ($100), shipping ($20), this and that. I also found the exact same loptop, even better ones, on ASUS website directly for CHEAPER. Obviously going straight to the supplier has it's benefits, but I once built a computer (~ten years ago) using mostly NewEgg pats. Point of the story, make sure you KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING, BECAUSE YOUR RETURN WILL SUCK WITH NEWEGG.","Other Thoughts:- Do you research with what is posted on NewEgg- Check the manufacturer's store for the same items- See how you can possibly get an honest return back, full refund, etc. Otherwise, DON'T BUY IT. You don't want to make large purchases that aren't at least a little insured. It's almost $200 in fees I am losing to return; it almost makes it better sense to go sell it yourself for $100 less, because people will still want it. Don't worry, NewEgg is getting it at cost or at the least WholeSale price which is at least half of what you are paying. Trust me, NewEgg is now just like the others.",0,0

Outdoor use is out of the question, unless it's midnight with a new moon.The ChromeOS didn't give me the flexibility I needed to use this as a telecommute and light programming device, so I installed linuxmint 19.1 cinnamon (pretty much my plan before I even ordered the thing).  The install was pretty straightforward, following the instructions found on the net for enabling developer mode and legacy boot. I chose to overwrite the entire chromeos knowing I wouldn't use it again. I was wrong. After suspending the system overnight, I couldn't wake/reboot it the next morning because the dev_legacy_boot flag got set back to zero.  Thanks, ASUS.  To boot I had to edit a script inside a recovery image so that instead of rewriting chromeos on top of my fresh linuxmint installation it would simply set the flag back to one.  The E203 model is perhaps a better choice if you're going to run Linux, as it looks more like a normal PC. However, you're stuck paying the Micro$oft tax with the E203.",1,0

DELL,E7240,4,Great value!,2018-02-21,"Pros:- The laptop was shrink wrapped and packed in a large bubble sleeve, and shipping was reasonably fast (around 8 business days to Atlantic Canada)- For a grade B laptop, it's in pretty good condition - a few scuffs and scrapes on the lid and around the ports, and a tiny crack on the edge of the lid, but the screen is scratch-free and battery life is around 3 hours- 8GB of RAM and a SSD drive keeps everything nice and snappy - startup time is only a few seconds","Cons:- The screen seems to be very blue and washed-out, but to be fair, it's a 720p business laptop screen, not a high-end monitor. I was able to adjust the colour a bit closer to 'acceptable' by setting a different 'Color Management' profile- I occasionally get an error that there is a ""Power surge on the USB port"", regardless of what I have plugged in- A 128GB SSD doesn't leave you with a lot of space - after installing iTunes and a few smaller apps, I have 46GB free.- The volume was up all the way when I turned it on for the first time, and when Cortana started talking I nearly jumped out of my seat","Other Thoughts:Overall, this is a great deal for the money.

As the documentation included with the laptop instructs to contact Joy Systems for any issues, I attempted to do so by calling the included tech support phone number.  After waiting on hold for over 30 minutes, I was sent to a voicemail which looped its outgoing message 4 times and then disconnected me.  I called back, waited another 30 minutes in queue and reached a recording stating their office had closed 12 minutes prior to my call being answered.  Finally sent an email to their support department and am awaiting response.Gave 2 eggs only because the laptop is, physically, in very good condition for the price and having been pre-owned.  The (presently unresolved) activation issue, however, has made the overall purchase experience beyond frustrating.

I mean, this stuff should make my computer overheat less right? NOPE.  I'm running on a CPU temp of about 95 degrees CELSIUS.  To put this into perspective, computer's CPU's should generally not exceed 80 degrees.  My computer, in this sense, is astronomical.  I mean, if you could hear it now,  I can't even hear the keys while I type the fans running so much.  I've checked everything.  Idk what's going on, but it doesn't seem to affect the performance.  Only shorten the battery's life span to like 4 min.Every minute I fear that this computers going to 1) catch on fire, 2) melt, or 3) Shut down completely.  Any of those would happen and I would not be surprised.  It actually hurts to put my hand on the side of the computer.  Idk what's wrong, but even the members at Geek squad couldn't figure out how to fix it.  So, I guess take this into account.","Other Thoughts:If you get one that works, I would SUPER consider getting it.  Other than that thing I described it's an all around great laptop.",0,0

HP,8570W,5,Surprisingly good workstation!,2016-12-17,"Pros:This laptop is great. Needed an inexpensive temporary laptop to work from home. Was expecting to get a Grade C and it be falling apart. Very surprised at the usable condition. Laptop has had no issues running 4+ programs simultaneously for a full work day. No issues with graphics, or processor speeds. Also, I'm able to run graphics intense games on it which was unexpected.RAM is up-gradable from 8GB to 32GB. I guarantee you that most people do not have 8GB, let alone 32 and it will run most applications.Also, lots of ports is something I needed for legacy devices and peripherals.","Cons:This baby is less mobile than some of the smaller laptops. Heavier but great for mobile workstation.Some small dings, but for Grade C it was great!",Other Thoughts:Upgradeable 8GB SODIMM RAM only about $55 at the moment,0,0
HP,8570W,5,Very good condition for a C grade refurb,2016-09-28,"Pros:For a C grade refurb item I was a little apprehensive about this purchase.  But I needed a laptop just for use around home, not travel or office, and I needed a unit with ample processing power for my needs, so a refurb fit my needs.The only ‘blemish’ I can find on the unit I received is that the finish on three of the corners is rough and worn, but just at the very tips of the corners.  The rest of the laptop is clean and looks like new.  The operation is flawless, runs like new.  The OS is windows 7 and installs without ANY bloatware and has a re-install partition if ever needed.","Cons:No cons found, does not look like new but at the c grade cost, it looks very acceptable.","Other Thoughts:I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap, powerful laptop to use around the house.  If you're giving a laptop to your graduate son/daughter then you should shell out the extra bucks for a new unit.",0,0
DELL,E7240,5,Works great after nearly a year,2019-01-25,"Pros:Wonderful daily driver for someone that has a home desktop, but needs a small laptop that is fast and powerful enough to be able to operate for long periods of time without the home desktop. Great for office work, great for homework, wonderful for browsing the web and some really basic productivity stuff.","Cons:Gets a bit hot when running things like Bluestacks, but it's a Dell product. It does come with limited storage space, BUT does have the option to expand it with another mSATA SSD. Also recommend to get a external portable HDD for those that prefer having a lot of shows/movies/music on their computers.","Other Thoughts:I usually break my laptop when I hit the one year mark, but this one doesn't show any issues like my other ones have (hinge, battery, and shorting issues). So I am hopeful it is the first that will be able to stay with me for a lot longer than just one year.",0,0

DELL,E7240,4,Great value!,2018-02-21,"Pros:- The laptop was shrink wrapped and packed in a large bubble sleeve, and shipping was reasonably fast (around 8 business days to Atlantic Canada)- For a grade B laptop, it's in pretty good condition - a few scuffs and scrapes on the lid and around the ports, and a tiny crack on the edge of the lid, but the screen is scratch-free and battery life is around 3 hours- 8GB of RAM and a SSD drive keeps everything nice and snappy - startup time is only a few seconds","Cons:- The screen seems to be very blue and washed-out, but to be fair, it's a 720p business laptop screen, not a high-end monitor. I was able to adjust the colour a bit closer to 'acceptable' by setting a different 'Color Management' profile- I occasionally get an error that there is a ""Power surge on the USB port"", regardless of what I have plugged in- A 128GB SSD doesn't leave you with a lot of space - after installing iTunes and a few smaller apps, I have 46GB free.- The volume was up all the way when I turned it on for the first time, and when Cortana started talking I nearly jumped out of my seat","Other Thoughts:Overall, this is a great deal for the money. I'd definitely buy another laptop from this supplier.",0,0

I wanted something simple that I can use for school work and Netflix in between classes and for online classes I'll be taking. So far this works perfectly for my purpose. I also like how small and compact it is. Easy to carry and very light. Also extremely quiet. I would 100% purchase again!",0,0

DELL,E7240,2,"Nice laptop, poor service",2017-08-21,"Pros:- Aside from a few dings and dents and a single dead pixel on the screen, this appears to be a very decent piece of hardware.","Cons:- Wrong activation key for the installed Windows version- Very poor (thus far, non-existent) support from 3rd party refurbisher","Other Thoughts:Where to start?..FIrst off, the item description says ""Sold and Shipped by Newegg"" but the item I received says it's from a 3rd party called ""Joy Systems"", which is where this all falls apart.On first boot, when attempting to activate Windows using the product key on the affixed sticker, I received the error message, ""This key won't work with this edition of Windows, so try a different key.""  As the documentation included with the laptop instructs to contact Joy Systems for any issues, I attempted to do so by calling the included tech support phone number.  After waiting on hold for over 30 minutes, I was sent to a voicemail which looped its outgoing message 4 times and then disconnected me.  I called back, waited another 30 minutes in queue and reached a recording stating their office had closed 12 minutes prior to my call being answered.  Finally sent an email to their support department and am awaiting response.Gave 2 eggs only because the laptop is, physically, in very good condition for the price and having been pre-owned.  The (presently unresolved) activation issue, however, has made the overall purchase experience beyond frustrating.  At this point, if not for the fact that I made the purchase through Newegg (with whom I've been doing business for roughly 15 years without a single complaint, up 'til now), I'd be seriously wondering if I'd been scammed.",0,0
HP,8570P,5,Much better than I hoped for,2019-03-14,"Pros:The price was great, and the computer looked much better than I was expecting from the description.  All I can find is 1 tiny scratch on the keyboard face need the bottle right.  The screen is good, the case is good.  The specs are great. I7, 8 gig ram, SSD. Much better than I was hoping for.","Cons:I have only had the laptop a few days, so I haven't had any problems yet.  This laptop has an optical drive so the case is a little thicker than you might expect looking at the latest laptops in the stores.  There wasn't an instruction manual with the packaging so I am having to figure out how to use it and which buttons do what.  So this may not be the best if you have never had a laptop before.",Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a cheap laptop with a SSD this is a great choice!  I would certainly purchase this again if I needed another laptop.  My only real complaint is that there is no manual.,0,0
HP,8570P,1,video went out - Newegg replacement process is a fail,2019-01-09,Pros:slightly larger ssd than I thought I was getting.  Clean super fast workstation.,Cons:While it says that I can replace it - and I check the item and choose a reason - the only button is 'Cancel'  there is no submit.  When I try to open a chat queue I get 121 people in front of me.

Overall, this is a good computer and works well enough for a college student.

DELL,E7240,5,Very nice system for the price,2018-02-15,"Pros:Fairly lightweight, complete set of ports, decent speed, good construction quality, good quality of refurbishment",Cons:None really,"Other Thoughts:I'm a systems admin by trade and see my fair share of laptops.  For whatever reason this one piqued my interest when I saw it in a Newegg sales e-mail last week, so I (uncharacteristically) splurged and picked one up to use at home.  My home needs are fairly basic and my existing laptop is long in the tooth.  So far I'm very pleased with this purchase.The quality of refurbishment by Joy Systems is very good.  There are no obvious scratches or mars anywhere on the laptop...screen, sides, ports, bottom, etc. They did apply a type of vinyl overlay/sticker/decal on the trackpad, the ""primary"" keyboard keys and the top over of the laptop to give the most worn surfaces a new fresh look & feel.  However, the overlay is expertly installed (especially the top cover) and I don't feel it detracts from appearance or usefulness.  I did remove the vinyl overlay from the trackpad just to see what it was like underneath, and the wear on the actual trackpad was minimal, so they may be doing these overlays for every laptop they refurbish, not just the ones that show excessive wear.  They've obviously spent a lot of time refurbishing this machine and I give them credit for the quality of their work.The laptop itself works just fine.  The matte screen looks good enough for my needs and having the bulk of the ports on the back (like power, Ethernet, a USB port for a mouse, etc.)  is super-useful for a desk layout.  I've replaced Windows 10 with Linux Mint 18.3...no problems whatsoever installing it.  Given that this sports a 4th generation i5 processor, you'd also have no problem installing Windows 7 on this laptop if you were so inclined.Between the quality of construction, thoughtful layout of ports, portability, quality of refurbishment, versatility of OS choices, 1 year warranty, and cost (~$300 for a machine that cost nearly $2000 new), I fail to see any reason why somebody should NOT buy this laptop.  It's a fantastic choice for a solid, general use computer.",0,0

Lenovo,Flex 2 15D,4,NICE!,2014-08-15,"Pros:Fast, responsive touch, decent battery life, and looks nice !!","Cons:Dis-assembly  was difficult, but expected with the style of device this is. Knocked an egg off for the cheap keyboard tabs. Two broke on both of these I had during reassembly.","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these for a customer to use on a touch based medical database system. I swapped the hard drives out for SSD's. As expected, the thin 7mm drives were required. But, during reassembly, tabs broke off of both keyboards with just a little pressure, which was necessary due to assembly methods. I was able to secure them anyways, so no worries, but its unusual for a Lenovo to be like this. one of my favorite things about them is their ease of repair. It takes three screws on my G780 and EVERYTHING is exposed. I will still buy Lenovo, and more of this model. I just wanted to make others aware so they can be more careful than I was.",2,0

Acer,C710-2055,4,Love This Thing!!!,2013-07-15,Pros:- Small form factor- 6hr battery life with general use- Synchronizes with Google account- Full keyboard,Cons:- Slows with large number of tabs- Music streaming & browsing at same time = sluggish- Lowwer battery life than advertised when streaming,"Other Thoughts:I truly love this machine. It does all of the low powered surfing activities I could ask for. My Google everything is synchronized with it. Google+ hangouts are phenomenal with this. I also, really like the convenience of a full keyboard that you don't get on a tablet (one of the reasons I got it). A note pertaining to the music streaming issues I had while surfing; this issue may have been due to slow WiFi in my residence.Overall, I love this machine.

I have a desktop that is very high end and I use it for all my gaming and everything else you can imagine.  I really just needed a machine I could make documents and spreadsheets on and keep all my more personal stuff organized with.  It may not have a whole lot of RAM or memory but it doesn't need it. You can store your stuff on google drive which is great. The Chrome OS is basically like the browser expanded into an entire operating system. Its simple and easy to use.

Mine was a complete failure after 7 months, Black screen (this seems to be a very common issue) mine is not even able to boot to bios; green flashing diagnostic light.  I will experience a month of downtime unforgiveable.  ASUS had no reference for serial number, watch your paperwork.

ASUS,UX490UA-XH74-BL,5,"Amazing Laptop! Thin, Ridiculously Light, Fast, Sleek, Well Priced, Runs Linux Smoothly, ASUS has a real winner here",2018-05-10,"Pros:As the title says, Thin, Light, Fast. The unit is Gorgeous! And it runs Ubuntu 18.04 like a dream - no issues with Suspend, or Resume, or any graphics issues whatsoever. The unit just works. On Linux, there's a mild issue with ALSA and the volume keys, but that can be resolved with a quick 3 liner fix to a text file.This thing mops the floor all around overall to the Dell XPS that I had just purchased and had to return. While the display isn't as solid on this as the Dell, in every other way, it makes up for it. And as for the display - who the hell needs a 4K display on a 14"" laptop anyways? Besides, Linux struggles with the 4K implementation between device vendors, so why have the hassle and the impossibly tiny fonts that 4K brings?As for Coil Whine that another reviewer complained about, there's none on mine. Again, the Dell XPS 15that I just returned had a bad whine - this is quiet, other than the gentle sound of the fan when it's charging.","Cons:None.When you need something that's got great build quality and reliability, and 'Just Works' (particularly with Linux), ASUS is pretty well my first stop.","Other Thoughts:Some of the reviews on here are complaining about ""FN Play""; strange thing to dock a laptop for. Keyboard implementations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, even on full size desktop keyboards. IMO, that's not a valid reason to dock any eggs. It's not even anything I personally would have noticed nor cared about, this supposed ""missing key"". As for the Coil Whine, if it's really that bad, exchange it; it's obviously not a generalized design flaw as my unit doesn't suffer from the issue.If you're looking for a small, gorgeous, reliable laptop, this is the laptop. At least, it sure as heck was for me and my wife!",6,2

You can't do anything aside from log into the computer.Edit: Overall I'm pleased with the functionality of the laptop but not the experience. I had to spend the first several hours of ownership troubleshooting issues. Even with most of them solved, the biggest Con for me is the fan. It cranks up often even when the CPU is lower than 20%.

Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),4,Fantastic machine for everyday use,2018-08-27,Pros:built to last,"Cons:You should upgrade it, this will cost some money.","Other Thoughts:Contrary to the other review listed here, this is not a bad laptop at all.To address his concerns-1. ALL Core i3, i5, and i7  U series processors in laptops (until the newest stuff came out this year) were/are 2 core- 4 thread processors. They work just fine. The only differences between them is the clock speed and amount of cache you get.Word processing, spreadsheets, Matlab, all of the stuff you would likely be doing with this Thinkpad work just fine.2. Yes, it comes with a Yugo slow 5400 RPM drive. A new 256GB SSD costs $70 here on Newegg. Order one with the Thinkpad.3. Yes, the amount of RAM on this machine  insufficient. It is very easy to acquire and install more. Do like I did, buy 16GB worth of RAM and install it yourself.4. Why buy a cheaper thinkpad that needs an SSD and RAM upgrade? Because it is cheaper to buy it that way! This is exactly how I bought my E550 from Newegg.My advice to you, find the size you want with the screen and processor you want and buy the cheapest variant you can find with those parts. You cannot really upgrade the screen or processor.But you can always upgrade the battery, hard drive, and the RAM.I'll be honest, the base option screen is pretty bad. If you can swing it get one with the 1080 IPS panel. It is the ONLY thing I don't care for on my E550.The speakers won't win awards playing music, but they get loud enough to be heard in a conference room or for a class presentation and they are very clear.My E550 also has the fingerprint reader. I love having it. It is fast and works well.The TLDR here is you should understand that you are buying something that you need to upgrade, but that it costs less to buy this vs the same model that already has the upgrades. Thinkpads are fantastic. If you want a real laptop built for the real world, get a thinkpad. Almost everything else is just an expensive toy.",7,1
Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),1,The Low Grade Hardware Renders it Essentially Useless,2018-08-21,Pros:It looks sort of nice,"Cons:Look closely at the specs of this laptop, its not your standard issue thinkpad. Its on sale for a reason. It's not obvious but it only has a TWO core processor which is almost always at near 50% capacity just sitting idle. The 4 gb or ram it comes with are not enough to do most things including browse the web, since modern versions of windows and browsers are relatively memory intensive. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the hard drive is incredibly slow and renders the entire laptop all but useless. I had a solid state drive handy and swapped it out so it could at least boot in under 5 minutes, but the processor and ram are still insufficient to make this laptop worth buying. It literally cannot run on modern software at speeds that are usable for day to day tasks. If you need something simple, look elsewhere.",,4,4

I was honestly expecting that to be way bulkier than it was.-Good sound from a laptop! A little bass-light, but the treble doesn't get ""tinny"" when the volume is up. Warm sound profile.-The way the laptop lifts when opened is really nice for typing. Very comfortable.-Whisper quiet, haven't heard the fans run louder than a breath.-Quiet keyboard, well-spaced keys. Didn't take long to accustom to. Love the number pad!-Fingerprint reader (not my thing, don't plan to use it) doesn't get in the way of the rest of the trackpad - easy to ignore.","Cons:-Webcam is laggy and grainy, but it's functional enough.-Features sticker was lopsided, and all of the adhesive stuck to the laptop when I ripped it off. Had to get it off with baking soda.  :(-Screen is a little bit wobbly if something bumps the table you're working on.-The brushed metal finish on the top cover is susceptible to smudging.","Other Thoughts:I chose this laptop as a system that I could use for work and grad school, and so far, it has not disappointed. Wouldn't necessarily recommend for a gaming build, but for what it is, it's a fast, light machine, and perfect for getting work done. Opted for this model over the Vivobook S for superior engineering and construction, and it definitely has the look and feel of a laptop in which a great amount of thought and intentional design was invested.Pros way outweigh the (mostly cosmetic) cons. Super happy with this laptop! Would definitely recommend for a solid mid-tier workstation.",2,0

ASUS,S530UA-DB51,1,Not what I am used to from Asus,2018-09-28,Pros:It's a compact and light laptop with good battery life.,"Cons:It's flaky.-touchpad is not very responsive and goes wonky when afflicted by the tiniest bit of schmutz-Bluetooth is wonky. Sometimes it bluetooths. Sometimes it doesn't.-Have to reboot every time you want to plug something into the aux jack or unplug something from the aux jack.-USB problems. Usually have to reboot after unplugging and reinserting a U2F key. Annoying because I have to use at least 4 or 5 different U2F keys per day.-Pretty much just have to reboot continuously. I probably went months without rebooting my K501UX.-At least it reboots quickly, because I have to reboot 20 times every day. I would go insane if it took more than 20 seconds.-Screen isn't great. It says that it is 1080p, but it doesn't look 1080p.-No immediate feedback when you turn it on. Like nothing lights up or anything immediately so you just have to sort of wonder if you held the key long enough. About the time you think you didn't and repress it, the screen comes to life the second you mash the power key again... so it has to start over. Wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to go through that 20 times a day...","Other Thoughts:We have been buying Asus laptops at our office for the last 3 or 4 years. This is the first purchase from them that I regret. My last Asus laptop (that I loved) was water damaged and I had to replace in a hurry to get back to work and didn't have a lot of time to shop. Dunno if I will buy another Asus laptop after this. Might try something else...BTW, I only used it for a few days before doing a reinstall / upgrade to win10 enterprise.  Went to Asus and downloaded all the latest drivers. Had wonky problems before the re-rack and have the same wonky problems after. It's just mediocre hardware.",0,1
