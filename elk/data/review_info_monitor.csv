LG,38BK95C-W,5,Amazing Monitor as of 4 months in,2018-12-07,"Pros:It  is big. i upgraded from the LG 29UM67P Black 29. Adding 9 inches was well worth itI love the Ultra Wide. I use to wide screens at work and I have 1 ultra wide at home and i Prefer the 1 monitor over the 2.It comes with HDMI, USB-C, DISPLAY PORT cords. as well as an adapter from USB-C to USB -A (standard usb)I use the USB-C port to fast charge my Smartphone.",Cons:No cons,Other Thoughts:Buy this Monitor!!,3,2
LG,43MU79-B,1,Worked for 1 month or so.,2019-03-16,"Pros:Size, price","Cons:Newegg won't accept for return. LG said they would replace, then didn't. Said they would send a technician to repair, and didn't. I wish I would've looked intro LG service before I purchased. Monitor lost display after short time.","Other Thoughts:Run from this or any other LG display. Monitors fail prematurely, and they will drag their feet repairing or replacing.",0,0
LG,43MU79-B,2,best picture of year,2019-03-12,Pros:4k movies,Cons:8ms and 60Hz its not a gamming monitor,Other Thoughts:no no,0,1
LG,43MU79-B,4,everyone should just move to big screen,2019-02-22,"Pros:big screen, spoiled me, it's now difficult to like smaller monitors","Cons:a bit heavy to me, not the best image quality but good enough i guess. bezel is pretty small for it's size but would like it even smaller. a bit of motion blur i see trailing my mouse.","Other Thoughts:wish it had higher refresh rates or adaptive sync. hope they continue to work on developing bigger displays, make it more thin, lighter, prettier, better quality. i would totally invest in more when they do.",1,0
LG,43MU79-B,5,Great Addition,2018-12-16,"Pros:Don't use my second screen much anymore, exceeded my expectations.",Cons:Don't think I could ever go back to a smaller display.,"Other Thoughts:Try it, you will like it.",1,0
LG,43MU79-B,5,Great out of the box.,2018-07-11,"Pros:Out of the box settings looks fantastic for colors and contrast compared to my 2 year old Korean made 40"" 4k monitor.Stand is heavy duty sturdy and functions well.Works great for my flight sims, cad drawing and Youtube videos. I love it so far.Anti glare feature is a big huge plus for me.",Cons:So far no cons,Other Thoughts:I think LG did a good job with this monitor design and function. I do not run fast action fpv games so I can't comment about the performance on those.,3,1
LG,43MU79-B,3,I Returned Mine for Refund,2018-06-30,"Pros:1: ***** video output from up to 4 sources simultaneously!!!!! (aka PIP/POP/PAP)2: DisplayPort 1.2 input3: remote so powerful that it can be pointed in nearly any direction and still be detected4: 5 video inputs5: joystick control is ergonomically nice size6: pedestal stand (rather than four toes, any of which can fall off the edge of the stand and crash it to the floor when attempting to optimize azimuth or move for cleaning), which is a more pleasant design7: 4K","Cons:1: ***** Uses Vizio remote control codes (nixes ability to use in same room as a Vizio TV)2: no ATSC tuner3: remote so powerful that it can be pointed in nearly any direction and still be detected4: remote control too tiny for single hand use by an adult male5: lacks UHF and bluetooth remote control options6: Dull output, as if it had been in continuous use for over a decade7: frustratingly slow response to input selection/switching8: has no digital audio output9: headphone audio output level so low that using it for an A/V amp results in massive change in volume level required 10hen switching between this and other audio sources11: no DVI input12: remote lacks buttons to directly access several frequently desired actions: source select, PIP/POP swap, PIP size13: internal speakers cannot be enabled/disabled via software/remote control14: no voltage to USB ports unless ""quick charge"" is enabled15: Win10 with DisplayPort 1.2 enabled irrecoverably blanks screen post-splash if using fullscreen mode16: no ethernet port, thus lacks ability to control via web browser17: driver disk instructions obtuse18: only 5 video inputs19: largest menu text size selection is too small20: menu text size defaults to virtually illegible tiny size21: online support seems to be written for some other model, has no firmware update section, has sections that don't crrelate to any supported functionality22: physical control/remote eye on extended pod on bottom is subject to potential damage during assembly/installation23: location of remote eye not apparent for blocking its use","Other Thoughts:I bought it because it was the only TV or computer display I could find in 43"" size that has PIP/POP, which apparently has otherwise disappeared (regardless of size) from the TV/monitor marketplace in the decade since I bought my Vizios. I've been a PIP/POP user more than 3 decades. Not having PIP/POP would cause painful withdrawal. Given the SRP, the lack of features is disappointing.I bought with 10% off promo code and temporary price reduction. Less than 3 weeks after its arrival, it was offered with an additional 10% net cost reduction.Overlapping remote codes with Vizio were sufficient alone to outweigh the positives and cause the return and refund.",11,61
LG,43MU79-B,5,Very impressed,2018-06-14,"Pros:Great quality for the price.  It wound up costing $524 after the sale and coupon from NewEgg. Great Deal.... Excellent monitor. I use it for 3d Steel Detailing.  Nice to see all of my models and drawings on such a large screen.  Great for real time presentations and multitasking!  Black  matte screen is identical to any good 28"" monitor as far as glare... so don't believe the post about exceessive glare...it bull.... I was running a dual 28"" mon. setup before and really like this change.",Cons:none so far,Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend the product to cad professionals.,5,1
LG,43MU79-B,5,Great monitor,2018-05-22,Pros:Really big...but not too big on my desk.The 4K resolution along with the matte finish make text and graphics very readable.The stand is very sturdy.On sale the price was excellent.,Cons:None for me.,"Other Thoughts:I've been using multiple monitor setups for securities trading for decades.  One of these is so much better than two or three 32"", 27"", or 24"" inch monitors.",4,1
LG,43MU79-B,4,Unique features,2018-02-08,Pros:has remotedisplays up to 4 simultaneous inputs in 1920x1080,"Cons:as mentioned elsewhere,  the leftmost and rightmost pixel columns must be viewed straight on - in normal usage the mouse pointer seems to disappear on the left and right - it is possible to turn on underscan, but that creates other issues",Other Thoughts:I've never had a monitor with that con.  The remote is nice considering how pathetic the control buttons on monitors have become.,2,3
LG,43MU79-B,5,Love it!,2017-11-23,Pros:USB C (Thunderbolt 3) connection works to my Dell 9360 (early 2017)Audio acceptableGood brightness,"Cons:Tilt only, no height or swivel (but maybe that's for the best - could be easy to fall over)Doesn't provide PD to charge the laptop (but I can live with it)","Other Thoughts:Had a 3 monitor rig before, happy to have just one big one now.  Laptop drives it no problem - no expensive docking station or dongle required - just make sure you get a proper USB C cable, after trying several, I successfully got a 'chipped' one.",8,5
LG,43MU79-B,5,It's larger than you think - and that is awesome!,2017-11-21,"Pros:It's huge! it's very bright, gaming is awesome on it! it has speakers that sound very good!","Cons:not much,","Other Thoughts:absolutely recommended, but you will need to have space for this. it is HUGE! love it though.. replaced a 27""+23"" multimon setup and i'm not looking back!",7,0
LG,43MU79-B,5,Late 2013 15” MacBook Pro Retina 4K @ 60Hz WORKS!,2017-11-20,Pros:Used Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable Rated for 4K @ 60Hz. Apple says this GPU only supports 4K @ 30Hz but right off the bat it works at 4K @ 60Hz! super awesome display colors calibrated at factory which required only to make it a little warmer to match the color on the MacBook Pro’s built in display. It’s absolutely gorgeous and the speakers are pretty good.,"Cons:Not many, some slight shadow artifact along the edges when viewing from middle of display but it’s all good it doesn’t bother me one bit.","Other Thoughts:Yuuuuge I tell ya, it’s yuge. Nice monitor, very nice monitor trust me I know.",11,2

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,1,BAD PRICE,2019-03-03,Pros:NONE,Cons:HORRIBLE DEAL,"Other Thoughts:You can find much better monitors than this one, I've seen monitors for around this price that had 1920x1080p 144hz Freesync much better than this one which is 1920x1080p 75hz, Conclusion JUST DONT BUY THIS!!!!!",0,9

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Great monitor,2019-01-26,Pros:Great pictureExcellent priceThin bezel2 hdmiVESA mountable,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:Bought 2 of these for my recent PC build. So far I am very pleased with both. Great picture that's consistant on both and thin bezel makes for a nice dual monitor setup. The sync with my MSI rx570 works great. Could care less about the speakers but nice to have i guess. Back of monitor could be shallower but doesnt really make much of a difference. Newegg shipping was extremely fast. Would buy again,1,0

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Bought on sale,2019-01-21,Pros:Price was 110$ I believe and for that price you cant ask for a better monitor.I know the speakers aren't great but for me if a monitor doesn't have speakers it might as well be useless I plug a ton of devices into mine I NEED the speakers.Freesync works great with my RX 580Input lag is lowMany optionsLooked great out of the box2 HDMI ports are a godsend when you also have a console plugged in.75hz is nice compared to 60hz,Cons:Does not come with a HDMI cable but atleast it includes VGA....yay,Other Thoughts:Buy it.

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Wow - looks really great.,2019-01-11,"Pros:I just got this today, and the color is amazing.    This looks so much better than my other two monitors and the one it replaced.   I'm tempted to order a couple 27"" models to upgrade the rest of my workstation.",Cons:None so far.,"Other Thoughts:Have only had this about a half hour, so it may have problems down the road, but I really like it right now.",2,0
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,3,Issue with monitor,2019-01-10,Pros:- Was good until I got a second monitor of the same kind and it didn't work,Cons:-First monitor worked great but bought 2 more and the 2nd one didn't work and I haven't even tried the 3rd.,"Other Thoughts:-I loved the monitor, so I decided to replace my other 2 monitors with this so they aligned, but when I plugged in the first of the 2 additional monitors I bought the display wouldn't work it would fade between random colors and not display my computer. I loved the monitor, but this is a glaring issue that isn't okay, if there's a way to fix my monitor I would love that.",0,0
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Very High Quality,2019-01-10,Pros:-brightness is on point-colors are good,Cons:-joystick menu key is annoying but not over whelming-no DVI or Displayport,"Other Thoughts:-not a con, but I haven't figured out the 75hz mode or the audio in for speakers via 3.5mm but hdmi sound works-box shipped with shakey noise, do not be alarmed, it's the accessories to the monitor not the actual screen-2xHDMI 1xVGA",0,1
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Fantastic monitor,2018-12-06,"Pros:The colors are great. Just make sure you go to the Acer website and download their color file. It's super easy and there are tutorials online for how to set up an IPS monitor. Star Citizen looks amazing. While an IPS panel can't display true black, it makes space look as though there's some depth to it. It isn't just a curtain with pinholes like with my previous monitor. Deep space looks and feels deep.","Cons:Took a little bit to get used to it. Nothing truly bad to state, the menu is excellent, it just took me some time to get used to how bright everything is. I felt like my eyeballs were being boiled for about a day, but not everything is fine!",,4,0
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Amazing monitor for the price,2018-12-04,Pros:-Beautiful picture-Menu offers plenty of options and is easy to navigate-144hz and 1440p looks and feels great-Tiny bezels make for a clean setup-Mounted mine to the wall no problem so the stand wasn't even a bother-No dead pixels,Cons:-The VRB does make the screen very dark but not enough of an issue to knock an eff off since it is an optional feature,"Other Thoughts:-The wobbling stand others had mentioned wasn't actually that bad. If you have a wobbly desk, then you will notice it. However, solid desk shouldn't have much issue with it. Plus you can mount it on the wall and make the issue irrelevant.",1,0
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,4,"Fantastic 144hz IPS, but a few dead pixels",2018-12-01,Pros:-144hz IPS-Great colors and response time,"Cons:-Noticed one dead pixel in the upper left of the screen, a cluster of 2 or 3 towards the bottom right, and another one further towards the bottom right. The cluster is the most visible, and definitely in a noticeable place. Not a deal breaker, as most of the time I'm gaming and wouldn't notice, but I wanted to point it out for others. Took off an egg for it.","Other Thoughts:I still highly recommend this monitor. At the time of writing this, this is pretty much the cheapest 144hz IPS you're going to find from a reliable brand. I'm disappointed about the dead pixels, but based on the other reviews mine seems like an edge case.",3,2
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Phenomenal!!,2018-11-20,Pros:- excellent picture quality- nice menu navigation with lots of custom options + onboard profiles- great value at $300- comes with displayport cable- thin bezels- no backlight bleed,"Cons:- stand color may clash with some builds, it's a deep metallic blue- couldn't figure out how to activate VRB for 1ms response time, but it's no big deal, can't even tell a difference","Other Thoughts:This is an excellent monitor overall. I'd highly recommend it over a VA or TN panel, too.",2,1
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,happy with the monitor,2018-11-19,Pros:looks nice1440 144hz ips freesync is exactly what I was looking for,"Cons:VRB is useless as far as I can tell, it makes the monitor so dark even at night I couldn't see enough to play games. At this price range I didn't expect <4ms on an ips panel so I'm fine with this.","Other Thoughts:I got this monitor for $300 which seemed like a great deal but there was very little info on it. In particular there was a lot of debate as to if it was a true 8 bit panel or 6 bit plus frc. I will say that when I set up my frequency I noticed that the monitor can be set to 10 bit when the frequency is 120hz or less, but only at 8 bit if the frequency is 144hz. I pulled up a gradient to try to determine if it was rendering 6, 8 or 10 bit, and based on the number of bands in the gradient it looks like it is an 8 bit monitor. I could see no difference between the 8 bit and 10 bit setting so I'm not sure why that is an option. Setting the monitor to 6 bit showed an obvious and massive drop in the number of gradients. Obviously I'm no expert but my interpretation is that it is a true 8 bit color monitor.",5,1
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Looks great,2018-11-17,"Pros:So far it looks great, haven't noticed any dead pixels.  Colors right out of the box seem good, ill fine tune soon. Right away i would recommend this.",Cons:none so far,,0,1
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Excellent!,2018-11-13,"Pros:Great color, refresh rate, response time and design. Coming from a 1080p 75hz TN panel, this thing is amazing to me. Looks very classy and sophisticated besides the stand which looks a bit gamerish. It's easily replaced so this isn't a con for me.",Cons:Nothing,Other Thoughts:Some people are commenting on the quality of the stand saying it's wobbly. I do not have this issue at all. I intend to put it on a full motion arm but for the time being the mount it comes with works just fine.,4,1
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,High performance product,2018-11-02,Pros:I will start off by explaining that there is no point in spending a few hundred bucks on a motherboard when most graphics cards and games won't go above 1080P anyways. I get full 1080P with my gtx 1070 TI and run at 75Hz with no problem using HDMI. I play world of warcraft and have flicker free flawless gaming. I do get 120FPS and feel that I get that on my monitor.,"Cons:Screen size I guess, bigger is better and this is onl7 21.5"".","Other Thoughts:I also get good performance with battlefield 4, GTA V, and star trek online. I also like the 1ms response time it is flawless. I just wish the screen was bigger but for the price this can't be beat.",0,10
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Price - quality!,2018-10-31,"Pros:I like the rigorous and frameless design of this monitor. Includes displayport cable. But unfortunately on my gtx980 there is not even a hdmi and I had to buy a cable separately. The picture is clear and very rich. After the TN panel, it really looks cool! I would recommend to install it on the wall (vesa 100x100), since its stand in my opinion is not durable. Dead pixels are not found, and I am very happy about it)","Cons:The monitor has built-in speakers, but the sound that they make is unlikely to be liked by anyone. But this is a minus, I do not think so. In general, everything is good!",Other Thoughts:It is worth it!,6,1
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Great monitor,2018-10-31,Pros:-Image is high quality-Great colors after calibrating-144hz at 1440p looks and feels amazing,Cons:-Looks good out of box but would suggest a bit of calibration to get it looking amazing.-Others have mentioned speakers and stand as cons but I have used neither one because I personally have desk speakers and a vesa mount stand.,Other Thoughts:I purchased this when it was on sale at $370 and in my opinion it was very worth it as an upgrade from my older 1080p TN panel.  With my GTX 1080 I am able to keep my fps around 144fps on competitive games and stay above 60fps on the prettier single player titles.,9,1

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,happy with the monitor,2018-11-19,Pros:looks nice1440 144hz ips freesync is exactly what I was looking for,"Cons:VRB is useless as far as I can tell, it makes the monitor so dark even at night I couldn't see enough to play games. At this price range I didn't expect <4ms on an ips panel so I'm fine with this.","Other Thoughts:I got this monitor for $300 which seemed like a great deal but there was very little info on it. In particular there was a lot of debate as to if it was a true 8 bit panel or 6 bit plus frc. I will say that when I set up my frequency I noticed that the monitor can be set to 10 bit when the frequency is 120hz or less, but only at 8 bit if the frequency is 144hz. I pulled up a gradient to try to determine if it was rendering 6, 8 or 10 bit, and based on the number of bands in the gradient it looks like it is an 8 bit monitor. I could see no difference between the 8 bit and 10 bit setting so I'm not sure why that is an option. Setting the monitor to 6 bit showed an obvious and massive drop in the number of gradients. Obviously I'm no expert but my interpretation is that it is a true 8 bit color monitor.",5,1

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Excellent!,2018-11-13,"Pros:Great color, refresh rate, response time and design. Coming from a 1080p 75hz TN panel, this thing is amazing to me. Looks very classy and sophisticated besides the stand which looks a bit gamerish. It's easily replaced so this isn't a con for me.",Cons:Nothing,Other Thoughts:Some people are commenting on the quality of the stand saying it's wobbly. I do not have this issue at all.

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,High performance product,2018-11-02,Pros:I will start off by explaining that there is no point in spending a few hundred bucks on a motherboard when most graphics cards and games won't go above 1080P anyways. I get full 1080P with my gtx 1070 TI and run at 75Hz with no problem using HDMI. I play world of warcraft and have flicker free flawless gaming. I do get 120FPS and feel that I get that on my monitor.,"Cons:Screen size I guess, bigger is better and this is onl7 21.5"".","Other Thoughts:I also get good performance with battlefield 4, GTA V, and star trek online.

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Price - quality!,2018-10-31,"Pros:I like the rigorous and frameless design of this monitor. Includes displayport cable. But unfortunately on my gtx980 there is not even a hdmi and I had to buy a cable separately. The picture is clear and very rich. After the TN panel, it really looks cool! I would recommend to install it on the wall (vesa 100x100), since its stand in my opinion is not durable.

With my GTX 1080 I am able to keep my fps around 144fps on competitive games and stay above 60fps on the prettier single player titles.,9,1

Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,"Great monitor for the money, but go ahead and buy an after-market stand",2018-10-26,"Pros:I got this on sale for about $370 and after a few days of use I am very happy with the purchase. Coming from an Asus 24"", 1080p 60 hz monitor, the shift to 1440p 144hz on an IPS screen is very noticeable. The screen seems very high quality, although as mentioned I don't have much to compare it to. Bezels on the top and sides are almost non-existent, wider on the bottom. Set-up was easy, and it has a little joystick on the back to help maneuver through the menus. Comes with the Displayport cord.","Cons:The stand is pretty lame, with a weak connection where it plugs into the panel and a comparatively unstable base. I have it sitting on a fairly heavy/stable desk, but the screen wobbles noticeably while I'm typing. Playing games where I'm mostly using a mouse it isn't as much of a distraction. If you already have a VESA mount this isn't a big deal, but if you don't have one, you'll probably want to order one (and factor that into the cost).","Other Thoughts:I'm running it with a 1070 Ti, so can't make use of the Freesync, but with what I have played so far I've been getting maxed out framerate anyway, so not missing it.Would highly recommend as a great value to anyone in the market for 1440p/144hz, with the caveat that you'll want some sort of after-market solution for the wobbly stand.",15,0
Acer,UM.WV0AA.001,5,Nice Monitor,2018-10-24,"Pros:IPS, 75Hz, Freesync, 27"", 3 year warranty, ""Frameless"" display, a toggle switch on the back to change settings (why hasn't anyone else thought of this?!) and even the speakers are pretty good. Tastefully done black and red color scheme. Vesa mounting.","Cons:A bit on the heavy side (19 lbs) and although the base is sturdy, the monitor does rock a little when touched or the desk is banged on.  Tilt only no height adjustment but I knew this going in.","Other Thoughts:I've had Acer monitors before and had good experiences with them.  I've even had a warranty repair once where they just replaced the monitor outright... with a newer model.This monitor works well right out of the box.  The colors are spot on in ""Standard"" mode.  There are six modes. The toggle switch makes changing settings dead simple.I got this to replace an ASUS 24"" that was working well but for some reason my RX580 didn't seem to like.  It would get some sort of surge whenever anything graphics intensive was going on.  It looked like a fireworks show on my screen and even made popping sounds.  Well my RX580 is not doing any of that with this monitor.  Could just have been a driver update or the fact that this monitor has Freesync... either way, I'm very happy with my purchase.  The ASUS survived and is now on my backup machine playing nicely with a GTX1060.",1,0

MSI,Optix AG32CQ,4,Decently good,2019-03-09,"Pros:I have used this monitor for about 3 months now, and have to say i am quite pleased with it. It does","Cons:My only real gripe is the VESA mounting. I would love to ask the people who decided what this monitor shipped with, why they skimped out on a VESA adapter plate that this monitor REQUIRES for mounting. its one thing if the monitor just has the holes and needs no adaptation, but this monitor has a aluminum protrusion for the included stand that is right in the middle of the VESA bolt pattern.I have to take an egg off an otherwise highly recommendable monitor. not including hardware that is required for a function of this monitor is unacceptable.","Other Thoughts:If you need a good gaming monitor, and don't require VESA then buy this, otherwise look elsewhere unless you want to pay more money.",0,0

You can turn off the red leds on the back. Came with both HDMI and DP cables.","Cons:One dead pixel at the very top left corner. The overdrive setting locks out the brightness control. Overdrive settings turn off and reset to normal if the resolution changes or the power is turned off. Sometimes after a reboot Windows doesn’t list 144hz in the settings, just turn the monitor off and back on with Windows loaded fixes it. No usb ports, so updates are probably not possible.",Other Thoughts:Its good for the price but needs a few issues fixed with updated revisions.,0,0
MSI,Optix AG32CQ,4,"Great monitor, cheap stand",2018-12-26,"Pros:Colors are vibrant in game, 2k looks very nice, the crosshairs option is there if wanted.It's 144hz","Cons:The stand does not raise, tilt, swivel, nothing. It's as basic as it gets.",Other Thoughts:If you're ok with a stand that you can't adjust or plan on mounting the monitor to a VESA etc. it's a good monitor.,0,0
MSI,Optix AG32CQ,5,,2018-12-05,"Pros:Very crisp, 1440p is definitely worth it, got it for a great price($350) the curve does take a little bit to get used to but once you do it’s quite immersive","Cons:As said by other review, there is some slight ghosting using vanilla settings, there’s a FPS preset that sets the refresh rate to “extreme” whatever that does it makes a difference.","Other Thoughts:Overall I’m super impressed, went from 144hz 1080p to this bad boy and I’m quite impressed",0,0
MSI,Optix AG32CQ,1,More Ghosting Then The Haunted Mansion,2018-11-27,Pros:- Nice Hi-Res Panel- Curvature Is Sweet- High Refresh Rate Is Awesome,"Cons:- I can't believe nobody else mentioned this, but the ghosting is awful on this panel.

MSI,Optix AG32CQ,5,Excellent - I am a believer now in 2K and 144Hz refresh rate,2018-11-15,"Pros:Curved display takes a little getting used to I play StarWars BF series BLK-OPS 2, and Battlefield 4 and a few others... Gaming is incredibly clear and very HD like to say the least... Colors were good, but I need to adjust and calibrate it sometime down the road.Assembly was rather straightforward - and the red backlight behind the monitor adds a cool effect - very nice MSI.Honestly, I was a little skeptical before buying it and thought if it was a no-go I I would send this puppy back to Newegg in a heartbeat. Ordered on Tues and got it the next day - Kudos to Newegg for that. The Box is very big, bigger than I thought it would be.I did not think the 31.5"" would be a whole lot bigger than my 27"" - boy was I wrong. I thought the curviness of the display would rob me of real estate, but it did not. The games appear so much more clearer and the GTX1070 works fantastic with it.The price was right at $329 - Nothing at local BB boxed store or anywhere else came close to it.I did not buy a 4K because our eyes when gaming - especially PC gaming cannot tell the difference and really not worth the extra cost...I have an older 1080p Samsung with worked great for a long time - but compared to the MSI 32"" curved monitor, there is no comparison picture wise.",Cons:Screws seemed a little interesting - one of them was missing washers - which had a minor effect on insertion and it came close to scraping my wooden desktop...,"Other Thoughts:I was expecting a little MSI swag or some MSI stickers or Case badge or some other goodies, maybe even an MSI stuffed Red Dragon - IT would have been nice if some sort of MSI bling or swag would have come with this monitor, I mean come one MSI some sort of badge and some other MSI Goodies would have been nice to users like me that have been very loyal to you... I use an MSI Z170I Gaming Pro AC LGA 1151 Intel Z170 Mini ITX mobo with is great and works awesome!",1,1
MSI,Optix AG32CQ,5,,2018-11-04,"Pros:Solid stand.Doesn't wobble while gaming.  I game on the keyboard tray, not the top of the desk (if that matters).Nice price for the screen size and specs.","Cons:Can't figure out how to put the cable clip on the back of the stand for cable management.  Doesn't seem like it fits properly, unless I have to really press hard.  I'll have to look at it again, but this is definitely a con since you'd expect something as simple as this to either already be part of the equipment or at least easier to attach.Not too thrilled about the power cord.  I have to set the power brick on my desk and It just looks ugly to me.  I'd prefer one single cord like most TV's and monitors have, but maybe there's a reason it's designed that way...I dunno.","Other Thoughts:First 1440p 144hz monitor I've owned...moving on from 1080p 60hz.  Wasn't sure if I would like the curve, but I love it.  I'm used to using a 42"" flat screen TV as a monitor, so I was looking for the largest screen possible with these specs and within my budget.  I'm extremely happy with the size of the screen despite being smaller than what I'm used to.I had a few models on my wish list, but was undecided as to which one to buy since the specs were the same between them all, so I settled on this one because of the red stand to match my rig and the brand name.I plan on buying again if my son ever has a need for higher quality gaming.",0,1
MSI,Optix AG32CQ,3,"Nice Monitor, with questionable VESA mount compatibility",2018-09-05,Pros:- size-refresh rate-color,Cons:-VESA mounting,"Other Thoughts:My main issue with this monitor was when I tried to wall mount it.  The tilt adjustment on the rear interferes with the VESA mounting plate, and requires partial disassembly of the monitor to remove.  I imagine with voids the warranty, so be careful if your intention is to mount this to the wall or a monitor arm.",5,0
MSI,Optix AG32CQ,4,"Big, beautiful monitor.",2018-08-02,"Pros:-Feels sturdy, well made.-Colors are BEAUTIFUL.-On screen settings are easy to use and navigate.-Puts gaming on an ENTIRELY new level-Wasn't sure if I would like the curve, but I love it. No lie when they say it makes gamming more ""submersive""-Its enormous.

So much color & detail..-Achieves 144hz. Gaming at 120 hz, 2560X1440 (using DP port) in FPS games and its an entirely new experience.","Cons:ONE DEAD PIXEL  : (  in the upper right hand corner ..UGGGHHHH..Not going to RMA over this. Its a primarily a gaming monitor, and this is unnoticeable in gaming. Just wish it wasn't there.The other things I didn't like about this monitor, like lack of height adjustments, and the red color of the vertical stand were things I knew before I ordered it. I can live with it.","Other Thoughts:I didn't think my antiquated graphic cards (2x GTX 680 in SLI) would be able to do 2K resolution in games without going into meltdown. Maybe a 3-4 degree increase, and usually staying under 60 degrees in 2560X1440. But I have nine case fans, two of which are dedicated to water cooler for CPU. Fast, graphics intensive games like DOOM & Bulletstorm (~100 fps on bulletstorm at 2k, 120hz) literally FLY with no screen tearing. But don't worry-1080p gaming looks great on this thing!This should be a 3-egg review over the dead pixel, especially since I had to RMA the first one (which the review of never was published) The fist monitor was cracked down the middle-literaly. However the RMA experience was fast and relatively painless....Not trying to plug Newegg or anything, but after they received and verified my return, I had a new one  in about five days. I have only had to return two other items back to Newegg out of many, many items ordered over the years-their RMA process is the best-and you don't get this type of treatment from other vendors-trust me.I have seen other reviews of very poor text display on this monitor. My heart sank when I first set it up and and couldnt hardly make out the writing under icons, text in emails, and alot of websites. This can be fixed by adjusting windows scaling, and cleaned alot of it up with NVIDIA control panel-there is also another windows tool to clarify icons & text, cant remember what its called.  I have found that SOME web sites dont want to display as crisp as others at this resolution, thats just the way it is. But when you watch a video that supports this resolution, you will LIKE.Freesync? It would be nice to have the NVIDIA optiion of this, but its more expensive, and aparantly I dont need it.Price? Seems competitive, considering the specs on this monitor when compares to others. I would rather spend a couple extra dollars and get it from a quality vender such as this that stands behind what they sell. You get what you pay for.I am far from an expert on display monitors. Hope this helps & happy gaming.",6,0

I just picked up a gigabyte waterforce 2080ti slight overclock gets a boost to like 2055-2100 ~55-60c with a 7820x @ 4.8 no HT (I have bad ventilation in my pc) But the card makes the world of difference on this monitor compared to the 1080ti (oced on water).  I had a feeling of input lag when fps gaming on the 1080ti but not really much at all now. I think a 144hz version would cure that issue...I play games with textures set to highest, low/med AA and much of the other effect on low/med...   with the monitor at 120 hrz.. playing mostly pubg, bo4 blackout, overwatch.. all get well over 110/120fps-190-200 fps ranges with the 2080ti.... have not tried bf1 rtx, I have i but haven't fired it up yet.  I have run no benchmark.I still have had had no flickering. I've seen many posters saying that it's most likely b/c your gpu isn't strong enough or clocked properly.  I've also found if you use ""extreme"" setting in the osd overclock it taxes the monitor too much and washes images out.  I set to normal.I would like a higher refresh for fps but otherwise, it's been a year now since I got this, no dead pixels, no flicker same mild bleed but still running strong.As for color settings, I feel it's very personal so don't think posting my color settings matters as much... plus I like a little bluer world... I really got this for the curve and wide angles.Day 3...  IMHO perfect viewing for desktop gaming.  The curve fills the view just right imho.I was using the Acer Predator XB271HU 27"" 165hz monitor.  And it was so stellar I decided to upgrade.  I run the 34"" at 120 oc using a display port.. no problems getting it up and going.   been on a 120 hz for may years and went to the 165hz could not go back to 60hz.  I was going to by the 100hz version but frankly its worth the extra $ to get the 120 imho.My framerates only suffer slightly pubg still hits 120-144 mostly mid to higher settings, overwatch 280-300fps mid/lower setting .  bf1 100-120+ mostly ultra settings.  since this has so many pixels really don't need to keep settings high imho.Running a WC zotac artic storm 1080ti at 2050mz and have a 7820 8 core w/o HT on at 5.0gz.Color out of box is solid but I'm sure color-a-files might disagree.  I like a colder setting changed this.The track light under the bottom edge is easily changed by color, affect and can be turned off via OSD.There is a joystick that moved the osd screen takes a little getting used to but if you game .. it's a joystick :)In generally the games look better and run smoother that the oc 165hz.","Cons:Major CON is shipping.

However, I don't know if I'm even going to return at this point. I think I'm just going to accept that I can no longer customize my viewing and resort to buying a DP to HDMI adapter and a DP extension and just plug and unplug the units I am using with it so that I can bypass the Predator's flawed button control panel.

I have 2 minor items:While the stand is very sturdy, sleek and well built (metal) it is HUGE. My work Dell 3417 has a much smaller footprint of a stand/base which helps put the monitor further back on my desk. This one not only eats up almost a foot of depth space, but the stand legs also awkwardly take up room in key areas. I would consider the monitor footprint and size up your desk in advance :) Now I miss my huge desk! I am going to remedy this by buying an articulating monitor stand that will help move the monitor further back.As mentioned in the Pro section, I didn't have to build/screw/assemble anything. The built in handle helped me easily carry the monitor out of the box and onto my desk w/ ease and safety. However, the box is HUGE. I could not comfortably carry the monitor box into my car from FedEx. I asked for help. Box was a bit dinged up so I worried, but fortunately, (crossing my fingers) I did not have any dead / stuck pixels and backlight bleeding / color uniformity seems OK. Maybe not as great as my 3417 to some extent, but the colors are nicer and quite frankly I bought this one for gaming so the features are better of course :)","Other Thoughts:I went back and forth on the Acer vs the Dell Alienware. Read all the comments in the forums, on Newegg and other sites. While I did not buy an Alienware to test them side by side, I am more than satisfied with the X34P. Despite what it says on Newegg, this is the latest X34 P variant w/ out of the box 100Hz which overclocks to 120Hz and the matte plastic on the back & upgraded metal stand which moves up/down/left/right and tilts. Only time will tell how long it will last, but Acer's 3 year warranty should suffice. Given the price was at least $100 cheaper (on promotion & sale) vs the Dell, this was a great value.",0,0

That is why this review is a 2 star.If Acer had a fix for the 120 hz flicker this would be a 4 star panel.It is a nice monitor overall but there is absolutely no excuse for Acer to release these at 120hz knowing they will fail in less than 2 weeks.I had great results from all my other Predator products but this will make me rethink Predator products and wonder if acer is going back to their old ways.If you can't wait for the new x35 from Acer or Asus you could consider this product.However the fact this product will fails at 120hz after two weeks is really shameful.

The colors probably aren't 100% accurate but they're nice and vibrant, and I don't do any professional work on it anyway. The high refresh rate is glorious, having come from a monitor with only half this one's and gsync completely removes any hint of screen tearing. The stand is a little large for my desk, but that's not a problem anyway as I've gotten a monitor arm for it instead. It's a nice stand though, to be fair. Completely made of metal and plenty sturdy.

Acer,X34 Pbmiphzx (UM.CX0AA.P01),4,Very nice monitor with poor out of the box color performance,2018-05-31,"Pros:Before this monitor, I had also used Dell Alienware AW3418DW for three weeks before I had to return it because of a defect in the monitor body.The calibration aspect of Dell Alienware was almost spot-on right out of the box, and you do not have to worry about calibrating. However, this is not the case with X34p, and I was expecting that based on the few reviews already out for the monitor. In anticipation, I bought the i1 Display Pro meter. After setting up the X34p, I spent a couple of hours gaming and then I did my first calibration using 120 cdm with an almost dark environment, and it gave me terrible results. The contrast ratio turned out to be 850:1 instead of advertised 1000:1. Delta errors were all around 5, and RGB lines were not tracking well with blue line had its own curve. One thing to note here is that the i1Profile software, used by i1Display Pro meter, can automatically adjust the Contrast, Brightness and RGB colors of this monitor. So, it was not that I might have missed something.I did my second calibration the next day and results were not very different. Then I started playing Breaking In color slides available on YouTube. Just search for ""21:9 HD LCD Screen Burn In Fix / Stuck Pixel Fix 10 Hour"". I played those slides for almost 40 hours, and then I did calibration again. Viola, Delta Error comes down to less than 1 for every color, RGB lines started hugging each other as they had never left each other and the final contrast ratio was 980:1 which is almost equal to the advertised value. So, I highly recommend using breaking in slides for this monitor.I have been playing BF1 online with GTX 1080ti @ 120 HZ, no problem what so ever. It overclocks fine without any issue. One thing I LOVED about this monitor is the menu control stick. It is so amazingly easy to change any settings on the monitor which every new buyer will do a lot in the beginning. Compared to this stick usage, Dell Alienware, Acer Predator XB127HU seems like bad menu controls. So, all thumbs up to fix this small but very annoying problem.G-Sync works without any hiccups. The only reason I have given it four stars is the fact that you need calibration with this monitor otherwise you may never fully utilize the potential of this monitor although Dell Alienware and X34p use the same panel.Other than the out of the box calibration difference between Dell Alienware and this beast, there is absolutely no performance difference (as far as I have experienced).",Cons:Poor out of the box color performance,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this product to others.,8,2

However....","Cons:Gaming at 120hz is pretty amazing coming from a 60hz monitor. Unfortunately, after using it at 120hz, it began to blink/flicker. Sometimes only slight, other times it speeds up. I have tried everything from drivers to monitor reset. I have come to the conclusion it is the overclock, because if I disable it and go to 100hz, it's fine. So I am now packing it back up to send off to Acer for RMA. They paid for the shipping so THAT is pretty cool. But very disappointed at the fact I have to send it back, as it is the nicest monitor I have ever used. Wouldn't be so bad, but apparently, this is a fairly frequent problem. I hope this isn't a matter of ""monitor lottery""...lol.","Other Thoughts:I can't say enough good things about this monitor. Even the setup was merely a matter of pulling it out, plugging it in, and using it. But I will STILL recommend this monitor to my friends, because the only thing wrong is the blinking.

I just picked up a gigabyte waterforce 2080ti slight overclock gets a boost to like 2055-2100 ~55-60c with a 7820x @ 4.8 no HT (I have bad ventilation in my pc) But the card makes the world of difference on this monitor compared to the 1080ti (oced on water).  I had a feeling of input lag when fps gaming on the 1080ti but not really much at all now. I think a 144hz version would cure that issue...I play games with textures set to highest, low/med AA and much of the other effect on low/med...   with the monitor at 120 hrz.. playing mostly pubg, bo4 blackout, overwatch.. all get well over 110/120fps-190-200 fps ranges with the 2080ti.... have not tried bf1 rtx, I have i but haven't fired it up yet.  I have run no benchmark.I still have had had no flickering. I've seen many posters saying that it's most likely b/c your gpu isn't strong enough or clocked properly.  I've also found if you use ""extreme"" setting in the osd overclock it taxes the monitor too much and washes images out.  I set to normal.I would like a higher refresh for fps but otherwise, it's been a year now since I got this, no dead pixels, no flicker same mild bleed but still running strong.As for color settings, I feel it's very personal so don't think posting my color settings matters as much... plus I like a little bluer world... I really got this for the curve and wide angles.Day 3...  IMHO perfect viewing for desktop gaming.  The curve fills the view just right imho.I was using the Acer Predator XB271HU 27"" 165hz monitor.  And it was so stellar I decided to upgrade.  I run the 34"" at 120 oc using a display port.. no problems getting it up and going.   been on a 120 hz for may years and went to the 165hz could not go back to 60hz.  I was going to by the 100hz version but frankly its worth the extra $ to get the 120 imho.My framerates only suffer slightly pubg still hits 120-144 mostly mid to higher settings, overwatch 280-300fps mid/lower setting .  bf1 100-120+ mostly ultra settings.  since this has so many pixels really don't need to keep settings high imho.Running a WC zotac artic storm 1080ti at 2050mz and have a 7820 8 core w/o HT on at 5.0gz.Color out of box is solid but I'm sure color-a-files might disagree.  I like a colder setting changed this.The track light under the bottom edge is easily changed by color, affect and can be turned off via OSD.There is a joystick that moved the osd screen takes a little getting used to but if you game .. it's a joystick :)In generally the games look better and run smoother that the oc 165hz.","Cons:Major CON is shipping.  This box is huge, so newegg/fedex doesn't box the original box.  (sort of like buying a TV online..  I accidentally ordered the 100hz version and it came in a very damaged box.  I RMAed for the the 120hz and notified NE the box was damaged.   The rma was approved.  Just be there when your monitor arrives...Price - but you get what you pay for - as another mentioned you could wait till they push out a 144 or 165hz .. but I can barely tell the differnce from 120hz to 160hz.",Other Thoughts:Will report back if pixels die or issue happen.   but well worth the coin IMHO,1,1

However, I don't know if I'm even going to return at this point. I think I'm just going to accept that I can no longer customize my viewing and resort to buying a DP to HDMI adapter and a DP extension and just plug and unplug the units I am using with it so that I can bypass the Predator's flawed button control panel.

That is why this review is a 2 star.If Acer had a fix for the 120 hz flicker this would be a 4 star panel.It is a nice monitor overall but there is absolutely no excuse for Acer to release these at 120hz knowing they will fail in less than 2 weeks.I had great results from all my other Predator products but this will make me rethink Predator products and wonder if acer is going back to their old ways.If you can't wait for the new x35 from Acer or Asus you could consider this product.However the fact this product will fails at 120hz after two weeks is really shameful.

The colors probably aren't 100% accurate but they're nice and vibrant, and I don't do any professional work on it anyway. The high refresh rate is glorious, having come from a monitor with only half this one's and gsync completely removes any hint of screen tearing. The stand is a little large for my desk, but that's not a problem anyway as I've gotten a monitor arm for it instead. It's a nice stand though, to be fair. Completely made of metal and plenty sturdy. At the end of the day, I'm really happy with the monitor I just would have appreciated it if newegg spent a couple extra bucks to cover up what was in the box.",3,4

I read through the other reviews underlining dead pixels and what not, has not been the case for me. Would definitely recommend!",3,2
Acer,X34 Pbmiphzx (UM.CX0AA.P01),4,Very nice monitor with poor out of the box color performance,2018-05-31,"Pros:Before this monitor, I had also used Dell Alienware AW3418DW for three weeks before I had to return it because of a defect in the monitor body.The calibration aspect of Dell Alienware was almost spot-on right out of the box, and you do not have to worry about calibrating. However, this is not the case with X34p, and I was expecting that based on the few reviews already out for the monitor. In anticipation, I bought the i1 Display Pro meter. After setting up the X34p, I spent a couple of hours gaming and then I did my first calibration using 120 cdm with an almost dark environment, and it gave me terrible results. The contrast ratio turned out to be 850:1 instead of advertised 1000:1. Delta errors were all around 5, and RGB lines were not tracking well with blue line had its own curve. One thing to note here is that the i1Profile software, used by i1Display Pro meter, can automatically adjust the Contrast, Brightness and RGB colors of this monitor. So, it was not that I might have missed something.I did my second calibration the next day and results were not very different. Then I started playing Breaking In color slides available on YouTube. Just search for ""21:9 HD LCD Screen Burn In Fix / Stuck Pixel Fix 10 Hour"". I played those slides for almost 40 hours, and then I did calibration again. Viola, Delta Error comes down to less than 1 for every color, RGB lines started hugging each other as they had never left each other and the final contrast ratio was 980:1 which is almost equal to the advertised value. So, I highly recommend using breaking in slides for this monitor.I have been playing BF1 online with GTX 1080ti @ 120 HZ, no problem what so ever. It overclocks fine without any issue. One thing I LOVED about this monitor is the menu control stick. It is so amazingly easy to change any settings on the monitor which every new buyer will do a lot in the beginning. Compared to this stick usage, Dell Alienware, Acer Predator XB127HU seems like bad menu controls. So, all thumbs up to fix this small but very annoying problem.G-Sync works without any hiccups. The only reason I have given it four stars is the fact that you need calibration with this monitor otherwise you may never fully utilize the potential of this monitor although Dell Alienware and X34p use the same panel.Other than the out of the box calibration difference between Dell Alienware and this beast, there is absolutely no performance difference (as far as I have experienced).",Cons:Poor out of the box color performance,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this product to others.,8,2

Stand is set up in a way that gives you plenty of desktop, and is extremely sturdy. The controls on the back are wonderfully intuitive and simple. Absolutely beautiful monitor. However....","Cons:Gaming at 120hz is pretty amazing coming from a 60hz monitor. Unfortunately, after using it at 120hz, it began to blink/flicker. Sometimes only slight, other times it speeds up. I have tried everything from drivers to monitor reset. I have come to the conclusion it is the overclock, because if I disable it and go to 100hz, it's fine. So I am now packing it back up to send off to Acer for RMA. They paid for the shipping so THAT is pretty cool. But very disappointed at the fact I have to send it back, as it is the nicest monitor I have ever used. Wouldn't be so bad, but apparently, this is a fairly frequent problem. I hope this isn't a matter of ""monitor lottery""...lol.","Other Thoughts:I can't say enough good things about this monitor. Even the setup was merely a matter of pulling it out, plugging it in, and using it. But I will STILL recommend this monitor to my friends, because the only thing wrong is the blinking.

Acer,X34 Pbmiphzx (UM.CX0AA.P01),5,so far so good,2018-04-30,"Pros:-Little RGB lights below the monitor that you can set. Allows for a few color choices plus various settings like ""breathing"" and ""ripple"". You can also turn it off.- Overclocking was simple and straight forward. Just had to overclock it in the monitor settings and then update Nvidia drivers.- Colors are great.- Resolution is nice for the size. It's a step up from my 1080p 27in"" 144hz monitor.- No issues on arrival.-Stand has a handle on it.",Cons:- The stand sucks. It's good quality in and of itself and I like how there is a handle on top but the way they designed it means it takes up a metric of valuable desk real estate. It pushes the monitor forward far too much when you have your desk up against a wall.,"Other Thoughts:-You'll like this monitor if you are in the market for an ultrawide and can afford to buy another mount if you don't use something like a dining room table for a desk. I ordered some wall mounts for this and my older monitor and I look forward to having my desk back when I get a chance to put those up.- I'll update if any issues come.

Acer,X34 Pbmiphzx (UM.CX0AA.P01),5,Ultra wide 21:9 is the real deal!,2018-04-28,"Pros:Size! Size does matter! At first I was skeptical of the ultra wide format. But productivity on this thing is tremendous. I still play alot of games as well and most of the newer titles support 21:9 format which is just awesome. 3440x1440 res is a good to game at as my 1080 Ti performs just fine. So its not near as taxing as 4k res but is a bit more demanding than a regular 16:9 1440p monitor.The curve of the panel is actually quite nice as it keeps most of the surface area of the panel within your field of view. So if you sit quite close to your monitor this actually adds an element of being right in the action for the gamers out there.Actual screen surface area of this 34"" 21:9 screen is comparable to a 32"" 16:9 screen.","Cons:After about 2-3 weeks my unit started to get some flickering and artifacting at the 120Hz overclock. I backed the overclock back down to 115Hz in the osd and have not had any further issues. But just know I do not believe the 120Hz overclock is guaranteed by any means.The box this baby comes in is absolutely enormous. I bought my unit at a local store but for everyone that orders this online, hopefully theirs arrives unscathed....",Other Thoughts:Obviously expensive but this is a premium product. Again keep in mind that the 120Hz overclock is not guaranteed. Mine seemed to do fine but after a couple weeks I started to get weird flickering that was indeed traced back to the overclock.,5,0

Acer,X34 Pbmiphzx (UM.CX0AA.P01),2,"Excellent display, defective speakers.",2018-04-21,"Pros:I've heard horror stories about the panel lottery, but my monitor came with no dead pixels, and barely noticeable back light bleed on the bottom corners.I previously owned an ASUS PB328q, a 32-inch VA monitor. It was great, but at 32x16 inches it was hard to see the entire screen. Even though the X34P is two inches wider, the steep curvature leaves the impression that you can view more of the screen.I haven't had much opportunity to game on the monitor as I've been attempting to solve the problems listed below, but my experiences with Dragon Age Inquisition and Wolfenstein 2 were butter smooth. I've had to lower graphics settings from what they were with the 2560x1440 PB328q, but the tradeoff is well worth it.","Cons:The speakers are defective out of the box. I've heard of some owners getting speakers that produce no sound whatsoever; mine produce sound but their is audible crackling that makes it essentially unlistenable. I've attempted a few software solutions but none of them have fixed the problem. I haven't decided whether to return or keep the monitor, as I'm sure I got lucky with the panel, but I'm pretty irritated regardless that QC issues like this exist for a 1000+ dollar product. I will update the review and score if I find a software solution.","Other Thoughts:On a more minor note, if this is the first ultrawide you are considering purchasing, be aware that not all software completely supports this resolution. Dragon Age Inquisition for example supports the resolution in game, but not in menus, which display with an ugly black border.",2,6

The monitor is huge and beautiful. The display is extremely sharp and smooth when calibrated. Games look absolutely stunning and are incredibly immersive. I was worried about the curve but it is great, you don't even notice it when gaming and it actually enhances immersion.It didn't take long to get this calibrated and configured, I read a few guides and tried recommended settings then I tweaked to my preferences. It comes set at 100hz and you have to set it to 120 with the OSD if you want to use that refresh rate.The biggest drawback here is cost. This thing costs as much as GTX 1080 TI right now.

(stand too)-Easy to set up-I won the backlight bleed lottery with none","Cons:-Nothing really except the price, but for me, it was definitely worth it.EDIT: Dead Pixel Middle of Screen - Read the edit in the ""Other"" section.","Other Thoughts:I originally wanted to get the Alienware equivalent of this monitor, but it was always sold out. One day, Newegg had it, but it was in the Marketplace and for some reason, it wouldn't take my preferred account, so I couldn't do the awesome 12 months of no interest. That's what originally sent me this way.My system isn't the greatest all around, but it works really well for me:i7 6800k32 gigs of DDR4-2800SLI GTX 780 TisI was worried that my GPUs weren't new enough to power this beast of a monitor. I was wrong. I can play many of my games in high settings at 3440x1440 at 100hz. The OC for 120hz works flawless on the monitor, but my gpu actually can't handle 120hz at this resolution. Found multiple threads after I got the monitor on a few sites with others having similar issues. I was afraid that going from 144hz TN panel to this IPS 100hz, I was going to notice a significant decrease. Honestly, I have seen an increase in clarity (from TN to IPS) and the speed difference from 144 to 100...I haven't actually noticed a difference yet. Most likely, the GSync is helping out too.I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone that has the computer power, money, and is looking for a gaming monitor. BF1, Destiny 2, FF XV (Demo), Star Wars BF2, and many other games just look amazing. I can't believe I went this long at a 23"" basic monitor. This is a massive improvement and won't be going away from ultrawides any time soon.EDIT AS OF 03/31:Seriously, just after my 30 days to return to Newegg comes up, my monitor ends up getting a dead pixel square in the middle of my monitor. I hear a small popping sound come from my monitor (no the built in speakers weren't on or plugged in for that matter). The middle of the screen got dark, then lightened up.Now, there is a black pixel right in the middle of my screen, and around it almost seems bruised. It's all darker around it by about a quarter inch. I tried contacting ACER but the warranty is supposedly needing 5 pixels dead before they will even fix the issue under warranty. It's sad paying 1k for a monitor, then have an issue and not be taken care of :( Honestly, if the dead pixel was even on the side, I would be okay, but being right in my line of site continuously...you can't even overlook or try to forget about it. I honestly wish now I saved a little extra to go with a different brand that would've taken care of this issue instantly.Don't get me wrong, the rest of the monitor is working well. I just don't understand why a high end monitor can't have a great warranty like the Alienware equivalent.",18,1
Acer,X34 Pbmiphzx (UM.CX0AA.P01),5,Great all-around performer,2018-03-22,"Pros:This has made working drastically easier. I work with two monitors, top/bottom. Top monitor has file browsers and a Matlab command console open. Lower monitor has graphics (data plots) and code editors open. With two 1080 monitors, I had to switch constantly between graphics and code. The ultra-wide, 2k has really opened up my available workspace to where I can get everything visible at once. Priceless.Arrived in perfect condition. No dead pixels. No physical damage. Brand new.Recently built a threadripper custom water block monster, and this was a great addition to that. Messed around with assassin's creed origins at 100fps and it was worlds better than my old 1080 v-sync. Ultra-wide is awesome when the game supports it. Literally, I couldn't go back at this point. I know, 100hz (haven't tried overclock setting yet) isn't as good as some of the 144hz monitors out there, but when faced with the UWHD constraint.... this is still hands-down awesome.Wide-screen movies without black bars are incredibly more immersive and unbelievably fantastic.","Cons:There's a back panel which covers the inputs which can be a little hard to snap in and out. I tend to just leave it off since the monitor is backed up against a wall and I never see the back.I can see how some would complain about the light leaks around the edges. Honestly, I've only ever noticed it when the monitor is on and not connected (full black screen). With any imagery being displayed, I never notice any light leak.Slightly disappointed at the bevel-less design since the pixels end about a quarter inch from the frame (leaving a black strip anyways).","Other Thoughts:This probably isn't the best gaming monitor out there. 144hz or higher is available. But dedicated gaming performance is a one-trick pony. This monitor may be slightly less impressive in the gaming realm, but blows away competition in all other respects. If you are looking for a monitor to do more than play games on, I'm convinced this is the best on the market.",0,1

The monitor is fully assembled inside, which along with packaging, makes it huge.-There is a faint but noticeable ""fading dark edge""  at the top of the monitor. You can only make it out on web browsers. It's very light and uniform so there isn't much to get upset about and in no way detracts from the ""experience"".-Despite being 8Bit+FRC, there is some very minor banding during certain games. This is not a true 10Bit panel, so don't let it fool you. Lots of things can be attributed to this but just know that it doesn't bother you while gaming and is in no way distracting (at least on my panel). Often times this can be solved by doing a bevy of setting changes and sometimes its the game itself.-Needs serious graphical horsepower to run games at max settings. (GTX 1080 or higher)","Other Thoughts:Despite the expense I would do this all over again. The experience has been nothing short of sublime. I lost my passion for games a few years ago. Growing up in the 80s/90s I was there for the PC Gaming revolution and this has breathed new life into that passion and ""made me a gamer again"". I'm totally convinced  there is no better gaming experience besides VR. Just make sure you have at least a GTX 1080 or higher in order to take advantage of this mythical beast.",3,0

I actually don't feel like i need an adjustable mount.,"Cons:- Calibrating- The panel on this does need a little calibrating to get a satisfactory image but with a little research of recommended settings and  you can calibrate easy, Although if you've got a buddy with software and a physical screen calibration tool i's always suggest going that rout.- LED Ambiance - Don't expect the LED strip to add to your experience, i use mine for lighting up my phone, wallet and keys. It works but isn't much of a selling point.","Other Thoughts:Overall i went from a Sony xbr 43-inch 4k tv to this. This was a straight impulse buy after working 58 hours overtime.  I must say i'm not disappointed at all. 4k is great and although i cant tell much of a difference. Right out of the bat this display is terrible. The whites were blinding and the blacks washed out. A little research goes a long way. If you have an AMD i still suggest going a different rout, but since this is the only good 34 inch G sync ultra wide its well worth the money if you can afford it. I may be a little bias since i really couldn't afford it and  i spent almost the same amount on it as my tv, Its still in my mind the best Monitor out there when games choose to support it. If you are a big fan of Overwatch i wouldn't suggest this until they get there head out of the ""competitive scene"" and add a full 21:9 setting.

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent Value Gaming Monitor,2016-11-22,"Pros:1. Ideal size at 27"" diagonal. If you went any larger it would have to be mounted further away from typical desktop viewing distance.2. AH-IPS panel displays beautiful colors. Noticeably better than the cheaper TN panel monitors I've used in the past. I cannot compare it to the latest, more expensive TN panel gaming monitors, but I suspect it is at least on par, if not better, simply as a function of the technology.3. While the GTG value is 5ms, as opposed to a TN panels typical 1 or 2 MS, I do not see ghosting while playing games.  I have played Fallout NV, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Dying Light, Diablo 3, TOR, Civ 5/6, and a few other common games without any distraction--unless you consider how great the color and contrast are as a positive distraction. And I definitely know ghosting and blur when I see it. I owned a VA panel monitor for about two hours before returning it because while the color was even better than the MX279H, its ghosting was extremely noticeably! Even Civilization 5 had ghosting.  I have not played extremely fast shooters, so I cannot speak to that.4. The super narrow bezel is really nice. It makes the monitor seem even bigger than it is.","Cons:1. The refresh rate is only 60hz. Remember when about five or six years ago 120Hz was a big deal and pretty much every LED/LCD monitor had that as a feature? Whatever happened?2. The buttons on the bottom of the screen are touch sensitive and it can get really annoying when you're making adjustments.3. The stand is pretty wobbly. This thing doesn't instill a huge amount of confidence in its stability. Every time I bump my desk it does the shimmy-shimmy-shake. It has never, however, fallen or seriously tipped.","Other Thoughts:At the current prices I'm seeing ($249 to $269), far less if refurbished, this monitor is a great value. Optimally, it would have a higher refresh rate, but for me its fine if I top out at 60 FPS playing a game that wants to tear with VSYNC off. There is a slightly brighter, 2K version that still only has a 60Hz refresh rate but they want a lot more for it.",2,0

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Awesome monitor!,2016-09-10,"Pros:So I'm writing this review after 2 years of owning the monitor.  It looks amazing! Has two HDMI ports on the back which is something I was looking for and very few other monitors have. The built in speakers are great, but don't expect them to get very loud. The different display modes are nice, the scenery mode on this monitor is one of the most beautiful I've seen. Pretty decent for gaming even though its a 5ms 60hz monitor.This monitor has even impressed some of my friends to the point that 3 of them went and bought one each. I'm now saving a bit to buy a second one to complete my triple monitor setup.",Cons:Can't think of any other than I don't remember it coming with any HDMI cables.,"Other Thoughts:This one is just personal preference, but I think a matte back would have been nicer over the gloss finish only because the glossy surface collects dust and marks. With the way my desk is set up, people can see the backside of the monitor and I'd prefer if it stayed dust free.",0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,So many pixels,2016-08-31,Pros:The colors on this monitor are so juicy! And the monitor itself looks amazing.,"Cons:There is some slight glow around the edges, and it gets a bit hot.",,3,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Everything I was looking for,2016-08-23,"Pros:- flawless IPS panel:- no dead pixels,- no background bleed,- great viewing angle,- highly adjustable;- very thin and light;- thin bezel;- sturdy stand with adjustable angle;- external power supply (no rigid cable);- connectivity (adjusts to everything unlike Qnix);- extra HDMI sockets instead of obsolete DVI / VGA- surprisingly good speakers;- unobtrusive 'on' light indicator;- normal pushable (not touch-sensitive) buttons",Cons:None as I know,,2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,3,"Great display, only issue was the bezel came with a few scratches on it",2016-08-12,Pros:1440p is awesome and the matte finish on the display is great. No dead pixels and no noticable backlight bleed.,"Cons:I bought this monitor as new and it came with 3 distinctive scratches, around the bezel for 400 buck i think this shouldnt be shipped out that way.",Other Thoughts:I would reccommend an ASUS 1440p monitor to my friends but not sure about this model...,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Disappointed,2016-07-23,Pros:- Good size-Thin bezel-bright,"Cons:the worst thing about his monitor is the backlight bleeding. The viewing angles are horrible because of it. Even if you only slightly move your head a couple inches, the screen becomes unwatchable, when watching dark movie?tv scenes. The blacks are also pretty bad, probably mostly because of the backlight bleed, but still they aren't great. I will try to get a refund or an exchange, because guessing from all the other positive reviews, I probably just got a defective one. What i thought was weird, is that it came in the actual monitor box, not in a shipping box. Maybe this has something to do with damage to the screen causeing backlight issues. I honestly have no idea. Im just disappointed.",,1,3
ASUS,MX32VQ,3,,2016-07-14,"Pros:Modern design, very good lookingPanel quality seems good. No bad pixels","Cons:After the base is assembled, the right side of the monitor is 1/2 inch higher than the left. This is VERY OBVIOUS, pretty annoying. I have to stack 2 small cards beneath the left part of the base, to make it even!No HDMI cable in the box although there are two HDMI interfaces on the monitor! Only a DVI-HDMI cable is provided.",,1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,,2016-06-26,Pros:Louder than you would expect for built in speakers and very clear. Excellent display and great overall features. It looks very clean and thin.

ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Refreshing take on a modern monitor,2016-06-21,Pros:-crisp clean picture with amazing black and whites-looks amazing on gaming use and even better with text-line out on the back of the monitor-small bezels,Cons:-small amounts of light bleed but acceptable,,4,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent so far,2016-06-14,Pros:Great image quality.Thin bezel.Very sleek and stylish.Built in speakers.No dead pixels or any issues so far.Buttons are easy to find and use.,Cons:No height adjustment on the stand.,"Other Thoughts:I am highly impressed with this monitor. I recent just built my first gaming computer and I was pretty scared of buying a monitor because it seems like no matter the monitor or how much you spend, there seems to be 10% of monitors that have significant issues. I hate that the industry has come to this but I suppose I won the monitor roulette with this one. Would highly recommend, the image quality is awesome and I am totally fine with the 60Hz refresh rate, no overclocking as of yet. The only bad thing is the lack of a height adjustable stand so I have to put my monitor up on something to get it to the correct height. I think it was a great value for the quality and price. But I most definitely bought the extended one year warranty just in case.",0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,"Bad backlight bleed from bottom right and left, unusable. Advertised as 1 billion color support and is only 16.7 Million.",2016-06-08,"Pros:Looks amazing as a package, the base is well made even though it only has tilt adjustment ( I knew that ordering it) The colors do look great after some adjustment but when using a darker screen or image, it is unusable for me since I do photo and video editing.",Cons:The backlight bleed is bad. Guess I lost the monitor lottery this time.,Other Thoughts:I will try one more time with this monitor. if it has the same backlight issue I will follow up with another review and will be getting a different one.,1,4
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Not as good as you'd hope.,2016-05-31,"Pros:Great size, great design.","Cons:1 .It is virtually impossible to find the color profile for it - the ASUS website doesn't have anything on it.  I wasted hours trying to find the proper profile, and nothing... so II still use some generic driver profile which is killing the quality.  I guess it will be great, once I find it or some poor soul from Asus App support will chime in with their ""dear valued customer, we're here to help"" routine.2. A HUGE pain are the touch-sensitive buttons on the bottom.  Some idiot mapped the leftmost button to the 'Real-size Paper Alligment' feature, so when you try to adjust display brightness in the dark, you often hit that leftmost button which goes through several cycles of A4 / A5 and other paper sizes on the screen, in full brightess, killing your night vision.  Real Genius.3 Speakers are junk, but that's livable.",Other Thoughts:There you have it.,1,2

ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Great product and wonderful display,2016-05-01,"Pros:The screen is  beautiful.  It's also, light, and easy to set up. I've had it for a year now and it's been trouble free and just as bright as the day I bought it. It might not be 4K; but, it's great nonetheless.",Cons:It's not 4K. It cost more when I bought it.,"Other Thoughts:Yes, I'd buy it again.",0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,"Fantastic display, color, and clarity",2016-04-22,"Pros:I got this screen as an additional third monitor to a pair of small TV's I had been using beforehand. All I can say about this monitor is wow, everything about it is darn near perfect. The vibrancy and saturation of the colors is astounding, and the screen size itself is perfect for gaming, photo/video editing, and whatever else you can throw at it.","Cons:Haven't experienced anything negative about it. Only wish was that it had more of a tilt angle, but other than that there is nothing wrong with it whatsoever.",Other Thoughts:Would highly recommend this monitor.,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Hidden Gem!! Incredible Monitor,2016-04-12,"Pros:- Can play any role for your monitor needs:  Excellent color-critical work, gaming, document editing, and movie/TV watching- Superior build quality and craftsmanship- Setup is a breeze- Worked even with my old 580gtx at native res- Bright enough to give you a severe sunburn- Many configurable and changeable options",Cons:- Some very minor backlight bleed...not a deal-breaker or of major concern- No adjustable height....again not a huge problem....just surprising b/c the design/build quality is amazing- Not 144hz.... (maybe not a con b/c I hear its quirky for all games to handle that at max),"Other Thoughts:My old 2006 Samsung 226bw finally kicked the bucket and I needed a replacement that could not only match toe-to-toe with its drool-inducing imaging, but exceed it as well.  After MANY days of reading, researching, and doing it all over again, I took a chance on this monitor.  Like others stated, 144hz sounded in theory to be what I needed (I'm a gamer) but too many ppl having issues deterred me (plus my machine is kinda old...got to have beefy hardware for that refresh rate).  What a major amazement to me when I hooked this beauty to my aging 580GTX!! I was actually able to play my games at 2560x1440 without a sweat!  What! How!  Amazing!! I totally thought I would have had to lower res or game settings, but this ASUS monitor took it all on! I only had to make slight adjustments to the monitor to get it to match the color saturation of my old die-hard 226bw.  What is great about this screen is it really can ""look"" however you want....seriously! If you are looking for a new monitor or another addition, look no further than at this Asus MX27aq.  You will not be disappointed!",4,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Absolutely Perfect,2016-04-06,"Pros:I love the look of these monitors. I purchased 2 and they look amazing. The attention to quality with ASUS products never disappoints. No blemishes or no dead pixels at all on both monitors. The metal exterior is a welcome design decision, as I am sick of cheap plastic products these days.",Cons:The color and dynamic range of these monitors are so good that I can no longer use any of my old monitors because they now look washed out.,,4,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Amazing Monitor!,2016-03-10,"Pros:This monitor is beautiful!  My old monitor was a 1080p 23"" Samsung.  When I have them next to each other, my old one looks like garbage (Dull, blurry, etc..).1440p IPS and 27"" has so much real-estate!Didn't adjust anything out of the box and it still looks amazing.",Cons:I have no cons to report.,"Other Thoughts:I would absolutely recommend this monitor.  After I plugged it in and saw the quality, I immediately thought about buying a second one, which I still might do! I did a lot of research on monitors before buying this one.  Anyone who is worried, as I was, about the 'slow' 5ms response time, compared to some TN panels at 1ms, do not worry.  I have been playing Tom Clancy: The DIvision on this monitor without any issues.  Everything is smooth and beautiful!",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Amazing,2016-03-08,Pros:1440p is perfect. The scaling is great with windows 8.1. Couldn't be more happy. The aesthetics are stunning as well. No dead pixels. No blemishes everything is perfect.,Cons:The box wasn't double boxed. Nothing against the product but come on newegg how are you going to ship a 500$ monitor with no protection or even a fragile sticker.,,5,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Beautiful Monitor,2016-03-06,Pros:The absence of a bevel makes it really nice to look at. The display is crisp and the color quality is excellent. The input buttons are all touch sensitive which is a great for reducing wear and tear and allows you to be gentle with it. The tilt angle range is wide so if you like for your monitor above eye level it will tilt down to accommodate that. I like the 2 hdmi setup. It comes with a hdmi to dvi cable to accommodate older gpus or ios which is nice. The ring style stand is solid and easy to attach. No tools needed to attach it. Easy setup. Wonderful monitor. Solid buy and worth the price.,Cons:They can't be placed side by side without having a bit of dead space between them. The the speaker housings protrude a bit from the rest of the bottom panel sides so you'd have to pull the tops of the monitors together to eliminate the gap they create.,Other Thoughts:Highly recommended.I'll update after some heavy use.*Update*: Bought a second one and have some backlight bleed at the bottom of the display. Can't seem to get the display to match the 1st one in terms of contrast and color saturation. Have to play with it some more but each monitor looks different from one another at default settings. Still happy with them so far but might RMA the second one due to the bleeding issue. Didn't have any such issue with the first.,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,ASUS MX279H - A great value!,2016-03-06,"Pros:I purchased two of these to replace my aging Samsung 226CW monitors which have served me well for the many years I had them. This ASUS monitor is truly a great value. The images are crisp, colors are accurate, and text is sharp. Also, the actual physical design of the monitor is very clean and kills other brands in the aesthetics department. These monitors feel very solid so I know these will last me a long time. The touch sensitive on screen control buttons are a nice touch as well. The security of ASUS's three year warranty also gives peace of mind instead of most other brands only offering a one year warranty.","Cons:No cons thus far, but only a suggestion which has been mentioned before- the film over the screen should be marked as ""do not remove"" in some way. The instructions call it out, but if someone does not read them out of the box, they may think it is a protective film that can be removed.",Other Thoughts:These monitors are a must have for someone who is looking for a solid monitor at a great value. ASUS again has made another great product!,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Beautiful Display,2016-02-28,"Pros:Bright, rich colors, sharp text.Very Stylish, no bezel/border displayDisplay Port and HDMI connectionsSturdy stand",Cons:No height adjustment. No big deal for me.Could be cheaper as some 4K displays are in this price range.DP cable way too short.,"Other Thoughts:Very nice upgrade over my old Dell 20""  4:3.   Had to turn down brightness as it is very bright.  Didn't do any calibrations out of box and it still looks good.  Games look great, no ghosting that I have noticed.Very satisfied with this monitor.",4,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Rough Start,2016-02-27,"Pros:The display is definitely an upgrade from my older ASUS LCD, but…","Cons:... the first monitor I received had defective power button and the second monitor I received began to flash ON and OFF. My first reaction was to blame the graphics card, but that wasn't the problem. I turned the computer OFF and then back ON, but it was still flashing. I switched from one HDMI connector to the other, still no change. The flashing was irregular and would stay ON for several seconds, and then OFF, then other times it would just flash real quick. I switched the monitor power button to the OFF position and then back ON, and voila, the problem went away. Since I can't do without a monitor for another 2 weeks, I'll see how it goes with this one. I'm very disappointed to say the least!","Other Thoughts:Newegg should allow attachments, because I've captured some video of this thing flashing.",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,"27"" @ 1440p = The Sweet Spot",2016-02-25,"Pros:+Design just looks really clean+Solid Construction, (Metal and Matte surfaces)+IPS panel, colors are glorious+27"" @ 1440p seem to be a sweet spot in pixels per inch+Gaming is smooth even at 60hz (using the game Dying Light)+Viewing angles paired with the anti glare screen cover","Cons:Note: Mounting options are limited, you have to use the provided mount. That being said the ""sun dial"" mount they provide is very good but might not be elevated enough for some users.",Other Thoughts:I compared this with several TN panels that had higher refresh rates. I am so glad I went with this one. IMO I think the IPS colors are much more valuable than a higher frame rate while at a similar price point.,2,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent Monitor,2016-02-20,"Pros:I received this monitor in perfect condition, no dead pixels, no backlight bleeding. The color is amazing, a little calibration was needed. It took my eyes a couple days to adjust to the difference between this and my old 1080 TN panel. I didn't realize how bad my old monitor actually was. I got this for gaming and I couldn't be more pleased, everything is so sharp.","Cons:I did a lot of research beforehand. I knew exactly what I was getting, so can't really nitpick features. I haven't encountered any flaws so far. So I'll just say there's no vesa-mount or height adjustment, but it fit my needs.",Other Thoughts:Now I need another one of these to replace my 2nd monitor.,5,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Nice Product But there are issues,2016-02-20,Pros:Bright screenWell designed productNice controls,Cons:Adjustments are to wonkyNot enough control over OSD functions,"Other Thoughts:Worked very well for 10 months turned it on today and my screen seems to have shifted on the right side. Its actually dipping to the right, cant seem to access the screen position controls if that will even work. I've never had issues with any of my Asus products before 2 Laptops 3 Mobo's currently running, External DVD, 2 other LED screens, Many other old Asus tech items laid to rest. I'm starting to wonder if the gift was worth the trouble.",0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Disappointed for Now,2016-02-10,Pros:Will update after Asus fixes my monitor.,"Cons:- Not a year has passed since I purchased this monitor and it is already having horizontal line noise in the lower third of the screen.- I did nothing out of the ordinary, all I did was turn the monitor on as I started up my computer.- A point of information: I am a system builder and I take proper precautions in protecting my devices through surge protectors and back up batteries.",Other Thoughts:I want to recommend this monitor but I am holding off to see what my experience will be when I send it in for RMA.I have read the reviews about the customer service of Asus. I am hoping my experience won't as what I have read. I know things happen to electronics is just a fact but the difference is how the customer service deal with the problem.I will update my review after I have dealt with the customer service.,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great 1440p monitor to start with,2016-01-23,"Pros:IPS panel has amazing colors with some tweakingBezel is thinGorgeous design, looks slickSurprisingly sturdy standComes with a DisplayPort cable",Cons:None that affect me,"Other Thoughts:I got this after playing the panel lottery on a Qnix brand. And needless to say, I've learned my lesson. This is a fantastic monitor, and while its no 144hz gsync. It still performs well for the price. I use it for many things from gaming, photoshop, and audio recording. The higher resolution is definitely worth it. Looks amazing and sharp. The higher end ROG monitors have the 144hz and gsync, but the QC isnt worth the price tag on those. I'm only running a single 980Ti so i couldnt take advantage of the higher refresh rate anyways. This will be a great monitor for a few years till technology advances and we see 4k take center stage.",6,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Beautiful monitor. The frameless design is a great selling point!,2016-01-20,"Pros:Great Design, image quality is great for 1080p, no dead pixels! Stand is sturdy! I don't care for 1440p or 2k monitors at this point in time. so this does the job well!","Cons:Nothing I can think of, this monitor was fairly priced!","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this monitor if someone wants a great 25 inch or less monitor, I did some research and decided not to go with the 27 inch, because 1080p isn't good enough when you get that big. Would need 1440p!",2,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Great monitor for the price!,2016-01-01,Pros:- Nice design- Clear picture,"Cons:- First one I received had a dead spot in the backlight, but Newegg promptly replaced it and the second one is perfect.",,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,I own multiple units of this model and the latest version (new features in menu) .. audio is horrible.,2015-12-25,"Pros:Good specs, good picture.","Cons:The audio sounds terrible compared to my other (4 units) 1.5 year old models. The dialog is extremely low (high frequency issues w/ monitor) and the bass (low end frequency) seems overexagerated. Using the headphone out represent the same issue on power speakers or headphones.Again I own 4 of these monitors and the latest one, newest firmware, I purchased a couple of weeks ago sounds really bad.",Other Thoughts:I will look into LG monitors. I read another review where the consumer said the speakers sound blown out and I have to agree. I hope Asus isn't selling refurbished units as new.Note: This is not my first purchase of an Asus MX279h.,0,3
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Worked for about 1 year.,2015-11-25,"Pros:Worked good at first.  Good resolution, sharp images, etc.",Cons:Stopped working after about 1 year of fairly light use.  Image problems that became increasingly worse until it was un-useable.I never bothered to RMA the monitor.  It's been sitting in it's original box for over a year or more now.  I have many ASUS products and have had good luck with all of them except this monitor which was not cheap and wasted my money.,"Other Thoughts:I build PC's and recommend ASUS products to folks that I build machines for and cannot do that after this experience with confidence without reading reviews on everything before recommending anything ASUS.  I've bought and recommended ASUS boards, laptops and just about everything ASUS but this monitor opened the door for me to to take a much closer look at other competitors products before recommending anything to my friends and colleagues.",2,4
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,"25"" ASUS MX259H",2015-11-05,"Pros:Size, thin bezel, great picture, speakers!","Cons:Size, stand, buttons, instructions!","Other Thoughts:Okay, I had for less than a week...never owned an ASUS monitor. Had to try one out. Great size, never expected 25"" to be big as it is. Picture quality is great! Graphic card: had to a tweak it a bit...very bright. Speakers are not as bad as you think. Not an audiophile. Not the speakers to play music on or watch a movie unless you want it on low. But you can watch anime or hulu or Netflix & be satisfied. I never expected the speakers to be great but hey, I can say they are better than other built in speakers out there. And if you don't like them then just connect external speakers and be done with it. I just don't want to deal with all the clutter of having external speakers out there. If I had to take an egg off then it would have to be the placement of the buttons underneath the screen on the bottom right. So cumbersome? What a pain!? That's my big complaint. But I only paid $209 on sale & free shipping. Diablo 3 runs great on it! Rich color!~A huge step up from my 17""  4:3 Acer monitor from 2005! You would be stupid to pass this up if you just looking for a new monitor. Or try the 23"" ASUS...it will not disappoint! I will update in 2 months!",2,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Good One,2015-10-28,"Pros:Beautiful design!  I like the silver. IPS panel is good. Brightness is good. I have a vx239h  also, compared to it  this mx239h has a slightly better speaker(not bad but do not expect too much) and unique silver version rather than simple black or white for vx239h","Cons:get it by 170 bucks, I think if the price could be 150 people will buy it without any hesitation. Although it has  so-called good speakers, but asus did not provide relevant software or driver for doby or dts sound effect.",,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Was great then...,2015-10-05,"Pros:Really big, nice viewing angle. The speakers are not bad if you have nothing else to use. Great color and picture quality.","Cons:Well I have owned this for a little over a year, and within the first 4 months of owing this monitor it started to burn the image(s) into the screen. If Im playing a game which has a stay in place bar (i.e health bar, action bar ect.) the image will burn into the screen in little time at all (less than 5 minutes). The background burns into the screen as well, after trying to play a game for 30 minutes the screen becomes so disgusting looking from all the burn imaging and it makes it extremely hard to play games, watch movies ect.","Other Thoughts:I am not sure if I just got a ""bad egg"" but when the monitor was new it was working amazing; shortly after using it (less than 300 hours) it began to ""act up."" I purchased this monitor when it was still relatively new to the market and now I no longer use this monitor anymore so now it is just collecting dust in the box it came in. I purchased another monitor. I would love to keep using this monitor if it did not burn the images into the screen. If I were able to I would send this monitor back in hopes of being able to switch it out with a replacement one. Anyways I hope this review does not make people not want to get this monitor as it is a GREAT monitor (when mine was working properly).",3,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Thinking about getting a 2nd one,2015-09-10,"Pros:Beautiful crisp IPS displayGreat sound, for in-monitor speakersSimple plug and playSharp styling, thin and looks great",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Bought this for my office where we don't play computer games but we do run CAD/CAM like AutoCAD and REVIT where the IPS does seem to make things easier on the eyes. We also write, edit and otherwise produce a lot of documents. We occasionally watch streaming video and it does that without problems as well.For the price (which has come down) this has been a great monitor which has run perfectly (knock wood) since I first powered it up.And since this is in my office where people can see it, I appreciate the sharp contemporary styling.I have been thinking of getting another one while they're still in the channel to make a nice dual-monitor setup.For the person who said it was too bright, note that there are several settings such as dynamic, reading, night, and so on that will let you pick the mode that your eyes like best.",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Look elsewhere.,2015-09-06,"Pros:Regardless of what other reviews said, I still liked the speakers a lot. You have to be realistic with your expectations of the built-in monitor speakers because the speaker driver is usually very small. I'd say great job Asus on the speaker and great job on the overall design of the monitor. Looks absolutely stunning.","Cons:Since this is supposed to be a computer monitor and not a toy, then this product unfortunately completely fails in its category. I am a big fan of Asus products but I consider this the worst buy of my life, without any exaggeration. The screen has terrible color reproduction, text is very blurry and it will give you headache. Whether you are watching a movie, editing video or photos, or playing games the screen is too sharp and does not reproduce visuals to any reliable accuracy.  If you are using this monitor just for steady images, then you might be ok with it. Otherwise, it will just give you pain. Do yourself a huge favor and stay away from this line of Asus monitors. They are gorgeous but they are useless.",,4,5
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,"Great monitor, but not perfect.",2015-08-24,"Pros:* No dead pixels and no major light bleeding* Great color and contract* Not bad for casual gaming and great for movies* Great for photo, video, and graphical renders* Buttons are smooth and awesome, and the setting menus are pretty straightforward","Cons:* Not ideal for fast paced gaming such as competitive fps games but this is a no brainier.* Although it is amazing for graphics, photo, and video editing, if you are using this professionally I recommend getting a display color calibrator for color accuracy.* Although ghosting is super duper rare to notice in games and videos, there is some noticeable ghosting for other things. Most noticeable is using a browser between white space and bright colors, there is some ghosting when scrolling. Nothing to ruin my experience though.",Other Thoughts:All in all I do love this monitor despite some short comings and it provides me a great viewing experience. Good job Asus!P.S. There is a lot of things I did not add to the pros due to it being mostly standard on IPS monitors.,1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,ASUS MX27AQ - 1440p IPS on a budget,2015-08-24,"Pros:- 27"" with 1440p resolution- Beautiful Design- Fantastic colors- 4 inputs! (3 HDMI, 1 DP)- Semi-glossy screen surface","Cons:- Speakers are over-hyped. They're crystal clear, but lack any sense of bass.- I noticed what looked like weird ghosting/shadows on text at first. Had to turn off ""VividPixel"" in the Image settings menu of the OSD to fix.","Other Thoughts:I kind of wish the screen would actually reach closer to the outer edge. The ""thin bezel"" design still has black bars around the screen. I would definitely buy another one or two of these if I had the space on my desk!",6,1

Doesn't come with a HDMI Cable, I had one in preparation for this product so no eggs off.","Other Thoughts:Hands down, best monitor I have ever own... full 1080p @ 60Hz....

The screen real-estate difference is unbelievable, and the picture quality is fantastic.I use this monitor for gaming and i see no tearing or refresh problems in the games i have played so far (LoL, Skyrim, ESO, Diablo3 and watchdogs all plays great in 1440p)i run this on an i5-4590 and r9 280x","Cons:the OSD is a little confusing, but you get used to it.it came with the brightness set to 100 out of the box, but after fine tuning the settings the picture was perfect.","Other Thoughts:the price seems to fluctuate some on this monitor. since i bought it it was gone up about $75If I could afford it i would replace my other 24"" with a 2nd one of these!",5,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great Monitor,2015-07-12,"Pros:Great picture and color. Thin bezel, could be thinner, but makes this monitor fairly decent for multi-display setups. Having the buttons on the bottom of the screen also helps. A lot of complaints have been about the touch sensitive buttons, I've never had an issue with them and i find them sleeker than push buttons.","Cons:No back-mount, but I knew this when i bought it as it's not necessary for me. If you wanted this back-mounted you'll have to create something yourself.",Other Thoughts:Overall great monitor. I have always been pleased with ASUS products.,1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Good over all,2015-07-12,"Pros:Good quality, Works beautifully.","Cons:At the bottom of monitor the front and back piece isn't connected right.I have tried to snap it back in place. Still works, and has no issues. but makes a pop sound when adjusting the angle or moving it",Other Thoughts:Would buy another.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,"SUPER bright, but very sharp",2015-07-05,Pros:*Uses physical OSD buttons for controlling the menu.*Very bright*Very sharp*No visible light bleed anywhere*No dead pixels*Fantastic response time,"Cons:*OSD menu is very difficult to navigate*VERY bright. Even with the brightness turned down, it's hard for me to make it bright enough to be pleasing but not too bright for night-time use. I probably need to mess around with it more, so not going to subtract an egg.",Other Thoughts:Buy this monitor... It's worth every penny.,3,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,ASUS MX27AQ Space Gray,2015-07-04,Pros:High Resolution in 27'' -thus higher dpi yielding better quality.IPS panel -so good viewing angle.Thin bazel - looks pretty coolBeautiful design overall.,"Cons:Speakers are not as good as advertised, or maybe I just had too high hopes from it.Colors are good and better than any TN panel I have seen but its not a huge leap from my previous Samsung S22C300. Just looking side by side the only thing I can see is the saturation and dark level is higher in this monitor. Well, I was really expecting more than that.Oh, and no height adjustment! I guess that much can be expected from a almost 500$ monitor!Also, if you are planning to play games on this then better be sure that your system can handle push this 1440p display at playable frame rate.","Other Thoughts:Overall I like the monitor and thus the 5 egg rating. This is the first 2k or IPS monitor I owned so I guess my expectation from this was too high and not practical. In any case this is a really gorgeous looking monitor, both design wise and display quality wise.",2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great Monitor,2015-06-30,"Pros:The color on this is great, with various modes depending on how you like your displays. Looks beautiful overall, very nice design. I use this as my main monitor for my pc and play my PS4 on it also.","Cons:I hate the heat sensor buttons. If you are in the dark and cannot see exactly where the buttons are, get ready for a lot random button presses you did not intend on. At one point I turned on some editing feature and had some boxes locked on my screen for a couple hours until I figured out what I did....","Other Thoughts:Overall I love this monitor, just wish they would do away with the heat sensor buttons....not very many people like them anyway.",2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Colours went out,2015-05-14,Pros:Looked great on the desk.,"Cons:A few months after I got it, the blues on the right half of the monitor stopped working, making everything reddish. Sometimes it would go away and look fine. Eventually, the whole thing lost colour and looked pretty terrible. RMA process was so terribly difficult I just decided to throw it in the trash and buy another monitor.",Other Thoughts:My second Asus monitor to die an untimely death. I'll stick to Asus for mainboards and the sort and stick with LG or whatever for the monitors.,1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Beautiful picture,2015-05-12,"Pros:Absolutely beautiful picture! Very bright, clear and easy on the eyes. Love the frameless design, but the image does not go all the way to the edges. The sound is very good, much better than normal flat panel displays.","Cons:Image does not go all the way to the edge of the frame, except for on the bottom. Does use a power adapter.","Other Thoughts:Very nice display, was a little disappointed when the image did not go to the edge, but (got over that pretty quickly) otherwise excellent.",4,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Amazeballs,2015-05-06,"Pros:I was putting a pc together part by part as I saved up the money and I had left the monitor for last because I was not sure what to buy. I was aiming for the pb278q from Asus but I did not like the way it's housing looked. That lead me to look at Asus' Mx series but sadly they didn't have a 1440p monitor in the Mx series which really sucked. Until the day I was roaming the lonely planes of pcpartpicker and I saw this baby. It didn't have many reviews since it was brand knew but knowing Asus' reputation I took a leap of faith and bought it. It came in a surprisingly thin box, it was in perfect condition and assembly was a single screw on the base. Once assembled I noticed how small it looks compared to other 27"" monitors and I realized it was because of how small the bezels were. The image is pretty sharp but the real benefit is the fact that it's is such a large screen with that sharpness. It helps a lot when working on a model in AutoCad or Inventor because it makes one forget that you are looking at a piece of metal glass and plastic and more like looking into a magic portal into virtual reality. It sounds a bit silly but makes sense once you see the appeal of a 1440p monitor.As for gaming, I do like it a lot. It is no 144hz monitor but it makes up for the fact with the rich colors coming from the IPS panel it's got. I have no complaints from this monitor at all. It impressed me with its bezel, resolution and surprisingly it's speakers. They aren't as good as a dedicated solution that has full and rich sound, I admit it lacks any real base but it is far better than what I expected from tiny speakers built into a thin monitor. So yes I do recommend this monitor if it will go into a work station, gaming station or anything else for that matter. Hell, if you are a narcissist slap a photo of your self and enjoy because I do!",Cons:Why wasn't it out sooner?,,16,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Decent picture... from far away... for two weeks... then it died...,2015-05-05,"Pros:Nice Colors, great picture from a distance","Cons:I bought 2 of these for a dual setup.  Both have vertical line noise... a lot of it!  I set the sharpness to 50 and vertical line noise is obvious on some colors.  Set the sharpness to 70 and vertical line noise is obvious on other colors.  I'm running DVI to HDMI.  I think I will try running it through VGA.  Also, about two weeks after receiving them, my right monitor flickered and had an image burned in, the flickering and image burn gradually went away after like 2 hours.  2 weeks after that, the left monitor did the same thing!!  Not sure what that's all about.  Maybe someone a bit more technical can tell me???  I'm not sure if it's just bad quality monitors OR i have bad noise from another source...",Other Thoughts:Menus are cumbersome because of the touch buttons.,0,1

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great monitor at a stunning resolution,2015-04-16,"Pros:- Great Resolution - 1440p is vastly superior to 1080p- Decent for gaming - man not bbe 1ms but it is still a great gaming        monitor- Colors are indeed splendid, typical; of IPS","Cons:Doesn't have a lot of gmaing features i.e. G-sync, 144hz, etc., but for the price it cant be beat.",,1,3
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Great Monitor,2015-03-12,Pros:The ultra wide 2560x1080 resolution is great for multi-tasking. You can have multiple windows open at the same time without compromising the size of the windows.The screen is crisp and bright.,"Cons:The sound isn't the greatest through line-in, but I have a separate sound system so it's not a huge issue. I haven't tried the audio through HDMI, but would assume it's the same.","Other Thoughts:The arm that connects to the stand is pushed flat in the box and requires some pulling to move it from it's initial position. I was worried that it was either broken or that I would break the monitor by pulling on it too hard, but once I got it loose I haven't had any problems.",2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Awful customer service,2015-03-05,Pros:Great monitor in generalSounds decent for built in speakersLooks good,"Cons:Worst customer support I've ever dealt with. It would take an incredible long post to list all the times they've fvcked me over during my RMA. Recived the monitor with 4 dead pixels and many that had dead sub pixels. Sent it in almost a month ago and still have not received it. I have been lied to by numerous support representatives about receiving a new one and have to deal with their Indiana facility being closed due to ""acclimate weather""- which has a reputation for awful customer support. These are only a few of the things I'm having to deal with. 2 stars for the monitor itself 3 off for awful support and getting dead pixels which many others have reported",Other Thoughts:Give me a monitor! i spent nearly $300 and only had it for a day,2,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,All good but...,2015-03-01,Pros:Very nice monitor with setting to adjust to your liking.,"Cons:Mine has had a problem with a vertical line about one inch from the bottom logo going all the way to the top.. It comes and goes. Tried the usual fixes but it seems that its the monitor.  Trying ASUS support, cant do a case number(always give me a undefined rejection) Tried to leave a call back name/number(always full and hangs up on me)",Other Thoughts:Finally got a case number by calling a different number.  Nice guy though-he will make sure I don't have to explain all again and escalate to maybe allow an exception for the 90 day thing since I've had the problem off and on for months...we will hope so.,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,3,"Good panel, poor case",2015-01-27,"Pros:Excellent LCD panel. Bright, clear, with an amazing amount of work space and lots of options for managing color, etc. 2560X1080 is the way to go if you use lots of screen space when working.","Cons:The buttons on the front are not mechanical in any way - just brushing them with your finger will activate them, which can be very frustrating in a tight work space. It happens alot, enough to make me wish I bought this from another manufacturer.There is a metal trim strip at the bottom of the monitor that fell off a few months after I got it. It was just tacked on with cheap glue.","Other Thoughts:ASUS doesn't actually manufacture the panel itself, so you can get the exact same screen with all the pros without the poor construction.Additionally, the back of the monitor doesn't seem to be compatible with third party multi-monitor stands and wall mounts, so keep that in mind if you are thinking of getting one.",2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,"Yes and NO, but merely so so",2015-01-23,"Pros:Color depth is amazing while having very little bleeding. Very thin bezel, but I'd still not recommend it for a multi monitor setup side to side.  Extremely bright (also a con though) mine had no dead pixels and I've owned it 11 months. I didn't buy it from newegg, it was in a local box store, and it being ASUS, I figured it must be good.","Cons:Every setting is so bright!! It reminds me of the dynamic mode on newer TVs. I dislike that a lot! Things just don't look right. Do NOT bother trying to read text. By far the worst monitor I've ever owned when it comes to the text. Not only are they blurry, but you can see colors surrounding the black text. It really just looks horrible. No display port, and it didn't say that on the box. Nobody at the store knew if it had one either. If I hadn't been called out of town for 3 weeks after I bought the monitor I would have returned it. Unless you want really bright colors, and just an overly bright display in general I'd steer clear of this one. Unless you like gaming with sunglasses on. (I actually may try this now just to see if it makes it more tolerable)","Other Thoughts:Overall I'd not recommend this monitor to my clients, or friends. I am amazed ASUS released such a poor quality piece of equipment. I'm usually completely satisfied with ASUS. This one fell far from the tree. Then fell in a hole where the floor gave out, and fell some more.",2,8

Ive never seen one like it and Ive used many monitors over the years. Im a pure hard core gamer and for that it is performing great. Everything Ive played so far.....even older titles from mid 2005 or so....have supported the 2560x1080 res. It is very bright and has amazing colors. The design of it is very futuristic too. Glad I bought it...thanks to my wife. :)  I very much recommend giving it a look if you're in the market for a new monitor.I went from an Asus VW266H 1920x1200 to this one and was worried very much so about losing that extra inch of viewing space in the verticle. But after using this one a few hours I didn't miss it at all. Thank goodness. So all and all a great buy at $400. Thanks Asus.,3,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Great...until it dies,2014-12-31,Pros:Beautiful and elegant monitor...until it crapped out.,"Cons:3 months and 1 day after purchase, the monitor started to flicker uncontrollably - like a fluorescent light with a bad ballast.  Doesn't matter which input I use, which computer I connect to, or which wall outlet it's connected to.  So now I get to start the process of trying to return something for which I no longer have the box for (and will likely be forced to ship it back on my dime). Thankfully I still have the receipt.",,1,5
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great monitor,2014-12-31,"Pros:Sharp picture, very accurate colors, excellent viewing angle (basically what you expect from an IPS). Speakers built in are nice convenience but by no means amazing. Similar to laptop speakers. Control buttons are hidden underneath front and touch sensitive.",Cons:Response rate at first seemed poor - like scrolling through websites or whatever you could notice the refresh rate lag but I can honestly say I do not notice any longer and would take the sharp picture that's easy on the eyes over a monitor less sharp and clear with faster refresh.,,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Great until it dies,2014-12-29,Pros:Great image. Great monitor. Then it dies.,"Cons:Monitor died in just over a month. It suddenly started to flicker horribly and then appeared to have a burned in image while flickering. I have dual monitor setup, and the other monitor is fine (Samsung, which is 5 years old by the way).","Other Thoughts:I am in the process of RMAing this monitor, which will cost me shipping and handling, plus packaging to send it out. Then of course I must wait 7-10 business day, in which I will receive a refurbished monitor instead of a brand new one I just paid for.",1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,pretty darned decent,2014-12-28,"Pros:IPS screen, minimal bezel, DVI-to-HDMI cable in the box, speakers in case you want them.","Cons:No VESA wall/arm mounting holes, and a silver bottom-edge bezel; this defeats most of the good points about the mostly bezel-free design.  No DVI in port, no HDMI-to-HDMI cable in the box.  Control buttons trigger on contact, not on push, so feeling for the button you want means you've touched several neighboring buttons you didn't mean to.","Other Thoughts:27"" monitor with all the features specified, and as little else as possible (tilt-only stand, no mounting options, no USB hub, power supply is a separate box), to keep the price down.  Bought it locally so I could return it easily should it not work out, but it looks fine so far.  Big Box had it in the gaming section only, not with the rest of the monitors.",1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Superb Asus Monitor,2014-12-27,Pros:I like the design of this 27in. Monitor. This one is a upgrade from my Asus 22in monitor. The picture has superb color and Monitor looks very professional on my desk. I like the solid stand. I used this monitor about 7 months so far with no problems. I use the default settings and had to adjust my screen size from 24 to 26 3/4in. This is the largest and best Monitor I ever owned.,"Cons:My video card with adjust the screen to 26 3/4in. or smaller. Don't move monitor when it's on. I did it one time to check the model number. The monitor turned off. I had to reboot the computer. Then I checked all connections, were fine. I had to wait about 3 minutes before it turned back on.",Other Thoughts:I have to be careful with these new age monitors. The old crt monitors can take a bump or a drop on floor. I don't think this monitor would take any drops or good bumps with out breaking. I recommend this monitor if you don't need to wall mount it. I still use my Asus vs228h-p.,0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Wonderful image,2014-12-20,Pros:This monitor has the best image of any monitor that I have owned in 30 years. Works well with games as well as applications. I have had no problems with the workmanship on mine. I bought this after researching the best computer monitor on the internet (C.R.) and I have not been disappointed.,"Cons:After reading the reviews at this time, it appears that others are having trouble with the build quality of their monitors. I would suggest sending them back and getting a new one. Possibly spotty quality control but mine has been perfect. Quality control is not typical of Asus.",Other Thoughts:You will get used to the odd aspect ratio quickly and after a while prefer it. You can easily do side-by-side documents or internet or whatever.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,"Amazing Display, Annoying Interface",2014-11-30,"Pros:The image quality and color depth is amazing, and stays vivid at every comfortable viewing angle. It has several preset color modes and a solid set of options for tuning the display just how you want it. The included HDMI-to-DVI adapter was nice too since my video card only has DVI connectors. Recommend it to anyone who values image quality over refresh rate.","Cons:The menu buttons are small, touch-sensitive and placed on the underside of the bottom bevel, all of which makes it annoyingly easy to hit the wrong button by accident.The 0.8mm bezel is not much thinner than most newer monitors these days. If you plan on do a dual-monitor setup you will still have a noticeable gap between screens. Listing this as a con because they market it as an ""edge-to-edge frameless screen"" and it's not.","Other Thoughts:I haven't used the built-in speakers so I can't comment on them. Two things I'd like to note though:1) This is a desktop model and isn't designed to go on a wall or a stand, so it has no mount points.2) Be aware this monitor uses an IPS screen that essentially sacrifices refresh rate (it's only 60Hz) for more vivid colors. 95% of the time I don't notice it, but the low refresh rate can cause tearing in some videos or games that don't let you adjust the FPS. If you want something faster, look for a TN monitor with a 1-2ms GTG. They are the most likely to have the 120Hz and 144Hz refresh rates.",1,1

ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Exceptional monitor,2014-10-06,"Pros:- Beautiful image with vivid color and contrast- Aesthetically pleasing nearly frameless monitor- Absolutely wonderful minimalist design in a nice cool silver color- Some don't like it, but I really enjoyed the push-free buttons!  It even senses how much pressure you exert on a button and will either go one-by-one or very quickly to your desired numeral setting.Just an all around tasteful monitor with classic appeal and the chops to impress anyone.","Cons:ok SO this monitor is incredibly fragile.  I have found this out the hard way, unfortunately.  I hate to list this as a con, but I am honestly so surprised that my monitor has gone from receiving a small fissure (hit something when being stored for renovations in my home) in the picture to losing picture in one hdmi input, and to now losing all hdmi input picture across both inputs.  All trainwrecking over the course of 24 hours.Oh and of course there's no VESA which I thought was a bit odd, but was not a necessity for me, but may be for you.","Other Thoughts:Overall, I would recommend this monitor due to it's great picture and tasteful design.  I broke my own monitor, but I am really upset that the whole thing has just gone haywire over 24 hours..  How does one crack lead to BOTH hdmi inputs failing?  Unacceptable.

(-2 eggs),"Other Thoughts:I've owned this monitor for over five months now.  For the majority of the time, I've thought the quality was pretty decent, and that others that had posted about shoddy quality had gotten lemons.  Then today, I walked into my office, and found that the faceplate/bezel on the bottom of the monitor had fallen off.  FELL... OFF....  OVERNIGHT.  WHEN I WASN'T EVEN USING THE THING, AND IT WAS IN SLEEP MODE.  I was able to stick it back on, and will probably just fix the problem with superglue... but this is honestly the first time in thirty years of purchasing computers that I've *ever* seen parts just falling off of a monitor.  And it's not like I'm a heavy gamer or anything - I'm old!  I don't even use the speakers in the monitor most of the time, so I can't conceive of any possible vibrations  loosening this faceplate.

It has been doing this for about 2 weeks and I have been hoping it would just go away, but it hasnt. I have also tried using different cables and monitors and the issue seems to be exclusively the monitor. And it has progressed to really bad screen burns every so often that just make everything look terrible!And now it seems like the speakers are rattling a lot when listening to movies and bass-heavy music, as if something is not secure in the monitor. But when I press to hand against the back the rattle stops, its really weird.I love this monitor, and want it to work perfectly, but it just hasn't. I am going to attempt some sort of RMA but honestly I am scared that it will take months to get a new monitor and ASUS will charge me to ship or something.

I use this monitor for a majority of gaming and I don't see any streaking or screen bleeding. Just a sharp fast picture with deep darks and vibrant colors.","Cons:I don't see this as a con ,but the only con I can think of is that the monitor does not come with any DVI connections, its 100% HDMI with 1 VGA. It does come with a DVI to HDMI cable, but my cards all have HDMI so I just used that.","Other Thoughts:Some reviews Blast the speakers on the monitor, though they do not sound like a surround sound setup (sarcasm), they are OK.

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Nice IPS LED LCD Monitor,2014-05-18,"Pros:Excellent Clarity, Stylish Design, No Dead Pixels on Arrival and Setup. Very Light Monitor (You can pick up with one hand).",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Speaker sound quality is the equivalent of your standard non-gaming Notebook computer.

Some DP splitters have rescan button that forces DP splitter to recognize the DP attached to it again after shutdown of computer. Didn’t try other DP attached screen but it is what is happening with this screens and my DP splitter.",1,7

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great Monitor,2014-03-16,"Pros:This monitor is almost perfect, I assembled my new rig 3 months ago, i5-4670k and SLI gtx 780, and I had bought Samsung S23A560H Plus for my monitor. Unfortunately having lived with CRT monitors for over a decade, I was not able to live with that TN panel for more than a week. So after doing some research I decided to buy VX239H, and because the VX model didn't have the Tracefree technology, I ended up with MX239h.... ""WOW!!!"" I said right after I turned on the monitor... no dead pixel, no back light bleed, amazing colors, ok speakers, everything was excellent. Unfortunately two things started annoying me one was the left bottom corner ips glow, and the other thing was that I wished blacks were a touch or two darker...I SOLVED the IPS glow problem, by adjusting my seat, and putting the monitor a a hand further from where I was sitting and wow it is no longer there....only if the blacks were darker!!! although this is common for all IPS panels and yet its blacks are far better than some of the Ips panels I have seen out there1: Amazing colors2: No Ghosting (Just finished playing BF3, Call of Duty Ghosts, Max payne3 and PES 2013) make sure to adjust tracefree based on your own monitor not reviews, my monitor trace free works best at 20. I bought the same model for my sister and hers is ok at 40, just download some of those ghosting tests online, and adjust the tracefree accordingly3: Excellent looks4: loud/ok speakers5: Ultra sharp, battlefield3 on ultra settings on this monitor made my other monitors/ and plasma TV feel only they are at medium settings in the same game at the same settings ( to get better sharpness go to Nvidia panel, and change the color output to ycbcr444 and just say WOW!!!)","Cons:1. IPS glow on left bottom corner (easily can be fixed by adjusting your seat, just lower your seat until the glow evaporates)2: Only if the blacks were a touch darker, but still blacks are better than 80 percent of monitors I have seen out there3. Doesn't wash my clothes",Other Thoughts:Overall: EXCELLENT MONITOR,3,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Meh,2014-03-13,"Pros:Slim Design, decent picture","Cons:unreliable.

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great place to buy as always,2014-02-26,"Pros:The color is amazing, sleek and stylish design. I took risk to buy monitor online, because its cheaper and chances of exchange for back light bleed, dead picels etc. But the monitor was in perfect condition. The monitor and other stuff i bought shipped within one business day. Free shipping didn't thought itll arrived so soon.",Cons:NONE,"Other Thoughts:I called newegg just to let them know how satisfied i am with their's business, but didn't expect free gift from them. I always shop at newegg, eventho sometime i have to pay few dollars more which is rare. But it worth it, because i can have peace in mind that they value their's customers at top priority.",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Nice Monitor!,2014-02-19,Pros:Backlit LED with super high resolution! Brought whole new life to my High Def Photoshop work I did on normal LCD's. Starcraft 2 looks great everything looks great no complaints! This thing will emulate to whatever native resolution you have hooked up to it automatically.,Cons:None that I can think of. This is just what I am looking for. Extra wide makes it so you can have more windows open and view more scrolling horizontal so decreases needs for multiple monitors.,,3,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great monitor,2014-02-14,"Pros:Very bright display with a lot of options to dial it in the way you want it to look!Great picture quality for gaming! Been playing quite a few different games on this including WoW, SWTOR, Defiance, War Thunder and The Secret World. The games all look amazing on this monitor.",Cons:I had some issues trying to get the picture to take up the entire screen with Win 8.1 Pro 64bit. I did end up having to download the AMD Catalyst Control Center and adjust the scaling options to get it to fill the entire panel. Was a bit of a pain to figure out though.The manual really offers no direction. The online manual is much better.,"Other Thoughts:I have owned the monitor less than a week but am very impressed with the quality so far. I was not sure if I would like this monitor, but then I saw it on display locally and decided that I wanted to try it out. I am glad that I picked it up as part of my new gaming build.",2,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,3,Good monitor but has some flaws,2014-02-04,"Pros:Great image quality, overall design is very modern, sleek, looks great.  Has 2 HDMI ports, 1 VGA, Aux-in, Headphone jack.","Cons:B&O branded speakers are awful, you can barely hear anything out of them at 100%, I used this on my xbox one to watch tv, little bit of netflix etc.  The speakers are so bad that my 15in macbook pro is louder.Second is the DVI-HDMI.  Most people connect their monitor from the computer with DVI, and usually use the supplied audio cable for sound like listening to youtube and itunes while working.  Nope, no sound since HDMI ports automatically disables aux-in.  WHAT?!?!  such a design flaw, there is no option to enable aux-in using HDMI.","Other Thoughts:Just get this straight up as a monitor, don't try anything fancy.",2,3
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Works Good,2014-01-23,"Pros:Just Like having 2 monitors , but no SEAM in the Middle .","Cons:WARNING !!!#1. You must have a Video Card that supports 2560 x 1080 Resolution .#2. You must be plugged into the right input or it will not work . After You get it to work , You can change the input selection from the menu .","Other Thoughts:I always put Glass on front of All my Monitors & TV , I am going to do that with this one too . I Like the 2560 x 1080 Res , but I think 29"" is just a little too small , I would Gladly pay an extra $100 for a 39"" , Also this one is only 5 ms , I think they could have done a better job & made it 3 ms  And yes I would gladly pay another $100 for a 1 ms",3,14

ASUS,MX32VQ,1,no longer a fan boy,2013-12-19,"Pros:I own arrays of asus products as I am a big asus fan.  Never had any issues with any of there products till I came across this particular monitor.When it was working as intended it did what it suppose to do.  Sleek looking monitor with vivid contrast with bright colors.  I was quite satisfied with the purchase.  Then few months later monitor itself started to act strange. It wouldn't go to standby mode, power would just turn off by itself, and grid function kept popping out for some weird reason.  So after speaking with the customer service they told me that I may have received the defective product and RMA it.  This is where the bigger problem lies.  Upon receiving the package, less than 24 hours for the repair, I get tracking number stating the monitor is being shipped back to me.  So i contacted the customer service again, and asked if the repair dept. was able to identify fix and test the product in less than 24 hours and they couldn't give me a confirmation if my monitor was repaired or not, and they told me to re-ship the monitor back to them when I receive it.Do Asus think if they receive the lemon and send the lemon back we won't know it's a lemon???? Frankly as much as I love the asus product, and loved this monitor when it was working, this whole ordeal is appalling, and insulting as a fan and a loyal customer.  I would stay away from this product and perhaps other range of asus product as well.","Cons:When it was working as intended it did what it suppose to do.

ASUS,MX32VQ,3,No VESA,2013-12-16,Pros:beautiful monitor,Cons:No VESA Mount. Seems standard now days... why are we limited to desk mount only on this?,,0,3
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Good IPS mon,2013-12-01,"Pros:- Great color and contrast.  Very clear and crispy.- Slim size, save some space on my desk- ""Frame-less"" (or borderless) design, looks modern.","Cons:- No DVI port (and display port).  Almost want to take out one egg ....- ""touch"" buttons, took some time to get used to and a little bit too sensitive but not too bad.- Sound of the the built-in speakers is barely 'ok'.- A little bit pricy  (yes, i know it's 27"")","Other Thoughts:Have been using it for 6 months, still have no problem so far.The first 1 I got had 1 dead pixel.  I returned it for replacement.  Thanks newegg for processing replacement request so quick.The default setting is too bright, so as in other modes (theater, gaming, RGB ... etc).  I managed to adjust the contrast and brightness and color level to low level like 30 something which makes my eyes feel lot more comfortable for long time usage.Some people complain about the response time.  I have no problem at all, no ghosting at all when playing any fps games so far.",1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great for the price.,2013-11-26,"Pros:- Sleek design gets many compliment.- Great viewing angles.- Great picture quality from the ips panel.- I've experienced no  issues in gaming, although I value color over response time.- Perfect size vs pixel density tension.",Cons:- Buttons are frustrating.  I'd much rather have physical buttons rather than the touch sensitive ones.- Stand feels a little cheap.  Not a big deal though.,Other Thoughts:Great value overall.  I use this mostly for word processing and gaming.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,,2013-11-25,"Pros:Clean, elegant design. It looks more expensive, feels more solid than most of the monitors I was comparing it to. The screen is matte, non-glaring which is a nice change for me. It can get VERY bright so I keep it turned down to about 70% brightness at the highest to suit my needs.There are a slew of settings that can be adjusted to suit your preferences.","Cons:I was expecting more clear, full sound from the unit. It can reach loud volumes without typical distortions but no matter the volume it always has a somewhat hollow, overly bass/mid range resonating sound to it. I've updated drivers on my soundcard and tweaked the settings to make it sound as good as I can. I finally decided I need separate speakers to enjoy music the way I want to hear it.Also there is a strange fuzzy crackling noise that comes from the monitor at times when I use the mouse to scroll or re-size windows. It's not terribly loud but it's noticeable. Maybe that's part of Windows 8.1 I'm not used to, or a shielding issue between the devices. Still, it only happens when scrolling or re-sizing windows... weird.The settings menu and adjustment buttons feel quite unatural and can be confusing at first... I'm getting better with them but still feels overly sensitive with no physical response to let you know you've pressed something.","Other Thoughts:I got this monitor on sale ($65 off msrp) which was still a bit over my set price point. I figured better components usually have longer lasting appeal and balance out the expense in the long run.Also I had to set the screen on my video card settings to fill the entire usable space, it left an inch or so all around on automatic detection settings. Even when filled to max capacity there is a 1/2 inch black border from the actual edge, which is fine for me. Although it would look really cool if that was even smaller or closer to non-existent. I'm sure it serves it's structure purposes.All in all it's a good monitor, almost worthy of it's price. If it was $300- $280 to begin with I would give it 5 eggs.",2,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great monitor !,2013-11-21,"Pros:I was looking for a monitor to plug with the PS4. I had heard of MX279H. Since I have it, I fell in love with. The colors are very bright, no dead pixel and product quality in general is excellent. For FPS games, a monitor is the best thing a player can get. You can buy it. I highly recommend it.","Cons:The only fault I find is that there is only one screw to hold the screen in place, but it seems solid. Otherwise, everything is perfect.",Other Thoughts:I highly recommend it ! Trust me,3,2

I had to go into the control center and set the overscan at 0 to fix the picture.",1,1

One of them has a full line of dead pixels, from the top to the bottom.The dead pixels show up randomly and will go away if you slightly tap the monitor, only to randomly return.ASUS - Please help me by contacting me to fix this!",,6,7
ASUS,MX32VQ,3,Looks nice. Build quality is lacking.,2013-11-12,"Pros:The screen is beautiful. Viewing angles are great. Colors really pop out at you. The emersion with this screen is super nice, especially when playing an FPS.","Cons:The stand is a bit wobbly. The buttons are located in the worst possible position, bottom right of the screen. The buttons are all touch based so my hand would sometimes just barely touch the screen when moving the mouse around on the desk. this causes the screen to shut off. really annoying. the plasticky covering left a residue on the stand which had to be cleaned off.",,1,3
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,,2013-10-13,Pros:I got three of these for  a 2d surround setup on my pc. They look good and have the smallest border I could find on a monitor. The touch sensitive controls are something to get used to but work fine.I didn't find a single dead pixel across three panels.,"Cons:other than no vesa mount, none that I can see","Other Thoughts:Others have their opinions about size and such for a triple monitor setup, I personally think these are great for such a setup but with no vesa mount you need a large desk or get creative to mount these to a wall.",3,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Work Horse,2013-10-10,Pros:Beautiful colors and contrast. Perfect for gaming and internet browsing. I play many games and have not seen a single instance of ghosting. When it comes to color reproduction or crispness for drawing in photoshop this monitor is very sexy.,Cons:There is one con but nothing too serious which seems to only happen in photoshop with the stock grey background. There seems to be a line running down about an inch from the center and about an inch thick of slightly brighter pixels and can only be seen from the corner of the eye as weird as that sounds. It only happens if there is no picture. Not really a deal breaker because it never really shows up in anything but a blank canvas in photoshop and even then you kinda have to be OCD to see it.,Other Thoughts:When I got this monitor I really had no idea that IPS had burn in which thankfully was only temporary and has since faded away from when it was brand new from the box. I run this monitor 24/7 with no sleep settings for about 5 months now and I must say this monitor has not disappointed. I am a professional digital illustrator as well and the color reproduction is one of the best I have seen.,1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Great Image Bad craftmanship,2013-10-01,Pros:The quality of the IPS panel is great. Colors are true and Movies on it are amazing. Didn't suffer any ghosting while playing BF3 at 2560x1080.,Cons:The way the screen was put together shows signs of it falling apart over time. I had the screen for about 2 weeks used it 9 hours a day and the front silver bezel unglued it self from just the heat the monitor was producing. It was such a major disappointment as the quality of the image was amazing. But having a high end monitor start falling apart within 2 weeks is so wrong. I just hope asus reads this and steps up there Quality control or revises the monitor bezel to have clips instead of being glued.,Other Thoughts:Would by again if its revised.,11,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Annoying Pixelated Line,2013-09-30,"Pros:Beautiful display colors, nice thin bezel and easy setup.",Cons:Very annoying pixelated line starting from the bottom then it goes up about three quarters to the top and goes across the rest of the screen.  Was very excited to get this monitor because i was upgrading from a very old monitor and was disappointed when i hooked it up only to have to unhook it and send it back because of that line.  I've been a happy Asus customer for years and never got a bad product till now.,,3,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Do not buy,2013-09-29,Pros:...,"Cons:1st monitor was changed because ot the dead pixel and permanent vertical black colored line at the right side of the panel.2nd monitor was changed because of the color corruptions both left and right side of the panel and panel deficiancy  after 3 months.Panel changed but it was scratched  !Thus, I didn't take it and  wating 4th monitor approximately for 1 month!This product quailty and technical service (in İstanbul) gave me only problems.

Now this greenish-blue tint has progressed to the full height and width of the screen. Also  the viewable area has image bleed through /ghosting (you can see a partial older image of whatever was last on screen).As a college student; this will be problematic for me. I can only hope this will be a speedy process for either repair or replacement.If there are ASUS Representatives  viewing these feedback pages, a little help in this process would be greatly appreciated. I have purchased many other ASUS products for myself and my family; 2 ASUS Laptops (G53SW-XN1/G72-GX), ASUS Crosshair V Formula Z motherboard,  ASUS Radeon HD-7950 graphics card and an Asus TF-300 Tablet.",1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Surprisingly Solid,2013-09-27,"Pros:Cheap, 8 bit panel, low/no FRC or other dithering, low input lag, okish response time, ~20ms lag.","Cons:Good bit of overshoot/overagressiveness on the response (darkish halo left behind) no DVI-D or even DVI-A input, touch sensitive controls annoying","Other Thoughts:Really a surprising little monitor.  Decent for gaming at ~20ms input lag.  Short of an expensive upgrade to the absolutely incredible Eizo Forris 2333 you aren't going to find a IPS or a native 8 bit panel that performs as well, and especially not at this price.The overshoot in ghosting response is a bit of a disappointment, and the lack of any inputs other than HDMI was almost a deal-breaker for me, but it's a solid little unit.  I bought it with the intention of upgrading, and it's a good little monitor for the price.If you want an 8 bit (might be 8 bit native) panel without the godawful dithering TN panels exhibit with reasonable gaming performance for a cheap price, this is an excellent choice.",2,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,"Great, but panel is off?",2013-09-24,Pros:Very good qualityGreat IPS panel.Very sharpEverything pops out at you.Great for gaming mostly MMO's.,Cons:None so far but other thoughts may be of importance to consumers.,"Other Thoughts:Ummm the monitor i got is a bit weird. The top corner of the panel has a bit of space left inside where if u press against it itll move inward. Its sort of popping out a bit i guess. If you look at it from the side you will see the panel lined up perfectly until you slowly move towards the top.This may be a quality issue. I have not experienced a monitor that does that but it might be based on how it was designed. It doesnt stick out like a sore thumb, but i noticed it stuck out a bit as i was checking out the monitor. The pictures provided by newegg also shows it too.",6,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Awesome Monitor,2013-09-13,Pros:Very Good ColorNo Input LagEven runs at 120hz (overclock)very nice FOV in games that support it,Cons:Not all videos and games are 21:9,"Other Thoughts:The design of the monitor is very nice. Picture quality is good too. I was really surprised that the monitor was able to overclock to 120hz. The only drawback would be the content available. If you are watching movies on bluray with 21:9, it looks REALLY nice. Pictures pop up etc. But if you are watching or gaming with 16:9 content, it can be a little distracting with black bars on the sides. (4:3 content too) Streaming movies or tv shows will show black bars on both sides. Still a very nice monitor with good design, picture.",6,4
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Great Monitor But No Sound,2013-09-11,Pros:Great image and design.,"Cons:Speaker Issues.  The first one arrived - no sound at all.  Just some clicking noise.  Ordered a replacement - came in fairly quickly (four days) plugged it in, the sound came on for about a minute then - half way in the song = dead/nothing.  There has to be some kind of production issues with these monitors.  I did not read all the reviews prior to purchasing but now see that a lot of people are having issues with the sound.  I've installed many speaker and am a pro with sound and tested everything with the first unit.  The second one I just gave up when it went dead for no appearant reason.",Other Thoughts:The Bang and Olufsen speakers were one of the main selling points for me with this monitor but having two DOA is troubling.  I have two Asus Zenbooks with the B&O sound and love them but what happend with this product?  I feel bad about sending these back so I'm going to ask for a refund after the second one.  Newegg has been great with their RMA process.  Asus should stop producing these and figure out what's wrong because having two dead ones back to back is clearly an issue.,4,4

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Everything I wanted,2013-08-29,Pros:Amazing quality in every way. I wanted to get a monitor with good color but not have much delay because I'm a gamer so input delay is bad but to my surprise this gives me amazing color detail and at no noticeable delay. The sound quality of the built in speakers aren't the best but if you had to use them they are at least pretty loud.,Cons:The sound card isn't that great so you are pretty much always going to want to plug you speakers or headsets into your computer.,Other Thoughts:I use this monitor for both my PC and my  PS3 and it works flawlessly for both.

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent so far,2013-08-16,Pros:No dead pixels that I have found yet.Overall a solid monitor and build quality seems good.Colors are vibrant and sharp.Don't notice any input lag or issues when playing Battlefield 3 or Crysis 3.I have not used the built in speakers since have a 5.1 setup so cannot comment on those.,Cons:Just the smallest amount of backlight bleeding. (normally only notice on solid black background when windows is loading)Notice the pixels on grey colors. (see other thoughts for more information regarding this),"Other Thoughts:I bought mine from a local store so I could return if needed. I first bought LG's 27"" IPS the 27EA33V which had a horrible red tint in both bottom corners. No settings on either the monitor or video card would get rid of it. Also moving around at different angles of the monitor would cause the whole monitor to look red. Probably a bad panel on it. Anyways returned it and picked up this Asus ($100 more than the LG I got) however the build quality seems to be much nicer and the base is a lot heavier so hitting my desk it doesn't seem to wobble around. Being slightly lower and having basically no bezel does make it seems smaller than the 27"" LG I had before.CONS Explained:So this is probably a thing with IPS monitors but first time I saw one with a straight white background (webpage) it was like you could see giant white pixels. On this monitor I can still kind of see them but not as bad as I can with the color grey. Some people I know don't notice it, however I myself do. I does not bother me and normally only notice it when looking for it.",1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,,2013-08-12,"Pros:great size,good price","Cons:IPS (my first IPS screen and I'm personally not impressed with this technology),pixels number could have been better","Other Thoughts:This is really a good monitor, if I had the choice I would go for a non-ips monitor but I still love it with good color reproduction.",1,6
ASUS,MX32VQ,3,Not worth the price,2013-08-09,Pros:This monitor produces a good image. The speakers are just ok. I like the 2 HDMI ports.,Cons:The menu buttons are way too sensitive. I don' t know if the one I got was defective but the screen is slightly darker a few inches around the edges. It was really noticeable when I played Diablo III at the bottom of the screen where all the options are for that game.,"Other Thoughts:This monitor is a disappointment compared to my other monitor which was much cheaper, and better display. I had high expectations from this monitor considering the price and specs. If my monitor was defective than disregard these comments.",1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent decision,2013-08-06,"Pros:- Excellent picture for computer output or TV.- Extremely thin edge.- Nice array of control options built-in.- With some simple and quick adjustments, the colors appear reasonably close to ""what the camera would see"".  Ability to quickly make these adjustments, because of configuration options, is impressive.- Switching between inputs is reasonably quick with minimal flicker/lag during switch-over.- Modern design and stand minimize overall desktop space consumption.- Did not see ghosting or blurring during motion/video.","Cons:- Buttons can be ""overly"" sensitive.  Would have preferred the buttons along the front bottom edge for clarity and simplicity.- Manufacturer's packaging could result in damage during shipment.  Box should be sturdier and have more styrofoam to protect it.","Other Thoughts:- Speakers could be louder - but this wasn't purchased with the intent of using the speakers.- While assembling, the stand may seem ""awkward"" or incorrect until you have it on a desk.  Initially, tilt action may seem ""stiff"" until it is worked a little.- Would like to see this same quality and feature set for a 1920x1200 monitor from Asus.  Excellent 1920x1200 monitors in this price range are very hard to find.",3,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,"Listen, don't buy it, or you'll regret paying for this expensive monitor !!",2013-08-06,Pros:None.,Cons:I brought two of these monitors and both of them have a very annoying ticking noise !!  I contacted their customer support and this person named Harold ended my chat session after suggesting that I should reset my monitor settings.  Horrible experience.  Don't buy Asus products such as their motherboards which require a specific memory cards ... you will just have nightmare and frustration with their products and their service.,,2,11
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Gorgeous monitor.,2013-07-09,"Pros:Looks amazing, unique in style, amazing colors, different settings that makes it easy to switch from standard mode to nightvision mode.","Cons:The touch sensitive buttons, they are not bad but not the best and they can be pressed accidentally when you are adjusting the monitor easily.",Other Thoughts:I'd recommend this product.,2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,First (hopefully lasting) impressions,2013-06-29,"Pros:An exceptional esthetic-industrial art at it's finest. Affordable IPS tech. It's one of the few silver fascia monitors out there, it goes well with my aluminum Gigabyte Poseidon case and all my old platinum/beige periphery. The image quality is astonishing-no reflections, intense, vivid colors, perfect whites, great viewing angles. Text is dead clear-my old monitor had me swapping reading glasses to combat eye fatigue. No annoying inconsistencies in the illumination-its perfect throught the screen. Warranty coverage-any truth to the rumor that it includes free shipping/cross-swapping in the first two years ownership?","Cons:With all consumer goods, there are compromises. In this case, it's the relative lack of adjustability built into the otherwise gorgeous stand. Which I am adjusting to, but I DO wish it were taller. At 6'4"", and in my chair-it's a mite low-lying and doesn't quite make the eye-level-to-the-top-of-the-monitor standard. I'm building a translucent acrylic stand to bring the height up a bit. Should be a beautiful combination :) Price: relative to what I consider to be this monitors close cousins, the AOC i2367Fh and the HP Pavilion 23xi. It doesn't have the tremendous screen real estate of my ASUS VW266H, but overall it's a far better monitor.","Other Thoughts:All things considered, I am very pleased with this monitor. It's light-years from the utilitarian 19"" 5:4 workplace monitor it replaced. And it's silvery goodness is a joy to behold-within a sea of charcoal or black generic designs. Great job, Asus.",3,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great monitor for the price.,2013-06-23,"Pros:Sharp video, nice colours, good angles of view, Much better than a good TN panel. IPS panels are a lot sharper. Totally satisfied.The sound is good ....for what I was expecting to be.","Cons:No cons, we pay for what we get and in this case, we get more. About the the menu: well all monitors have some weird menu to deal with ...  once.","Other Thoughts:very nice looking monitor, the design is modern, if you use the inboard sound, you won't be ashamed.  I'm happy with my purchase.",0,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,"Great, but a bit expensive",2013-06-06,"Pros:Thin, looks great, sharp, colors are vibrant  and speakers are actually really good for being on a monitor.","Cons:Bezel or neck is lose, there is some wiggle.  Button layout is a bit off, the touch sensors are nice but can sometimes be mistakenly hit.","Other Thoughts:I ordered two of these monitors to use for primary building a website, work purposes and gaming.  Now I know these are not gaming monitors so to speak, but I have had no issues with them so far.  I don't really know much about monitors refresh rate, but I believe the 5ms is enough.  The colors are great, sharp and vibrant.  However the price of these monitors was too much, I do believe I could have picked something similar in size and still got a good picture quality and maybe even a 1ms refresh rate for at least $100 less. The speakers are fantastic, I enjoy them BUT it would have been nice to have this monitor without them.  Cost would be less and majority of us are going to go with other sound options anyways.  The monitors look amazing but I have a bit of wiggle in both of mine where the neck of the bezel meets the monitor.  Now a huge deal but I notice little things like that.  Buttons on the monitor are touch sensitive which is a cool idea, but sometimes when trying to just feel for the button in a darker room will cause you to change settings.  Also could just be me but I would have rather had the volume buttons near one another rather than to be separated.  Overall you pay for what you get, and in my opinion these monitors will last.  You also can't beat ASUS 3 year warranty, and that right there is why I spent the extra money on these rather than 2 cheaper models.  Yes somethings could have been left off this monitor to drive down the cost like the speakers, but overall if you have the cash and you don't want to question the purchase get these!",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,LCD Monitor,2013-05-25,"Pros:NIce matted screen, clear no dead pixels, stylish","Cons:It gives a full screen appearance when it's turned off, however, when lit there is a 3/8"" border when turned on.  The internal speakers, presented a very small hum. I played with all sorts of volume settings and and could get rid of it. Nice monitor could be just me.",Other Thoughts:I used the headphone it the back which worked out great. Makes me think why did I order a monitor with speakers in the first place.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Sexy,2013-05-06,Pros:Looks awesome and haven't had a single problem yet. I own two and it looks great with multimonitor gaming.

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,,2013-05-03,"Pros:Beautifully designed monitor with a matte finish on the screen.  Excellent colour and contrast, with the ability to change preset schemes and switch them on the fly.

The first one I got new which was great. The second one I bought an open boxed one, It came with an internal problem rather than missing accessories as advertised. Tried to RMA but they wanted to charge me a $50 fee for shipping and restocking.Nevertheless, I still recommend the monitor, as long as you don't mind the small details",1,1

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Wow Factor,2013-04-19,"Pros:This is a superb monitor that deserves all the praise that it has received.

They are beautiful side by side and provide a tremendous viewing area.","Cons:For the life of me, I can't think of one!","Other Thoughts:Newegg continues to be a terrific source for my computerneeds.  Excellent web interface, quality products and quick shipping are their hallmark.",1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Beautiful and no glare!,2013-04-16,Pros:BIG. Bright. Beautiful. Thin bezel. Stylish. No glare.,"Cons:Controls take a bit of getting used to.  Really annoying at first. The only minus.  Oh, and while the built-in speakers are Bang-Olufsen, they are still a bit thin on sound...better than most built-ins, but they don't take the place of a good set of external speakers.  I don't use them, but listened to them out of curiosity.","Other Thoughts:Wow, I absolutely love this monitor.  It's a 27"" viewable monitor that fits in a 24"" space! Almost no bezel at all.  The styling is amazing and so is the screen.  I have large windows behind me and with this monitor, I can work in daylight with minimal glare.  My last monitor reflected everything back at me and really bothered my eyes. Newegg had the item to me the next day (I live pretty close to the NJ warehouse). Newegg is the best.",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Led monitor with futuristic design,2013-04-10,"Pros:-Nice looking, elegant, sleek, and modern-Great Picture contrast-Slim Form factor saves space on desk-Contrast/Picture Presets are solid for gaming, movies or productivity-frame-less design(Flush panel frame in better words)-The led lighting really brings images to like life; Makes bright colors really pop and intense-IPS panel; The images are very clear and crisp!",Cons:-The touch buttons are simply put not practical. Too sensitive and hard to make precise adjustments. Though they are functional.-Doesn't come in black!,"Other Thoughts:Overall, The monitor is designed very well and is a great 27 IN LED monitor. Wished It came in black!",1,2
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Not worth the price or the frustration,2013-04-01,"Pros:Nice design, matte finish over the lcd (=no reflections), ASUS support actually has live people in the US.","Cons:No sound, picture is dark, controls are too sensitive, not really a true ""frameless"" design.","Other Thoughts:The first monitor from Newegg arrived with no sound and the picture was dark even at 100% brightness.  ASUS support couldn't figure out the sound issue so I exchanged it for another one.  The second arrived with the same problems - no sound and a dark picture.  I'm sending this monitor back today.  If you do any kind of graphic design this monitor is not for you, I found the colors to be too dark and too intense to be accurate.  I guess I should have known better than to think I could find something better than my current Samsung monitor.",2,5
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Beautiful monitor but not for gaming,2013-03-26,"Pros:- IPS Panel- 250 cd/m2 (I prefer 300+ but this was suitable)- 27"" :)- 80,000,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio- 311mm pixel pitch - though anything greater would be a con IMO- Hardly any backlit bleeding but still noticeable - comes with the territory of IPS panels however- Dual HDMI- Minimal bezel - awesome for multi-monitor setups!- No dead pixels","Cons:- 1920x1080 (this size is suitable for me and for many I talked to but I do feel that a screen this size would be better paired with a tighter resolution)- 5ms (GTG) and 60Hz - real world response time averaged 16ms. That and coupled with a 60Hz refresh rate, ghosting was apparent (yes I know of Tracer Free) and was very apparent while gaming which was a deal breaker for me- No DVI support- No DisplayPort - so much for future proofing- Controls are extremely sensitive!!","Other Thoughts:I ended up sending this monitor back to Newegg (at a restocking fee hit of just over $50) because while I thought the monitor was very beautiful I couldn't endure the response time and refresh rate working in tangent negatively for anything fast-paced. I thought I could really learn to deal with it because I really wanted a high-quality display monitor (IPS in particular) while not breaking the bank but I obviously couldn't. As mentioned in the Cons section the actual response time averaged 16ms which I could not accept for gaming. While that may be good for an IPS panel - it is not for gaming if you are particular like me.I ended up going with ASUS's VG series - VG278HE. I have to admit, while the color reproduction is not close to the level of the IPS, it still is very good! So if you are into gaming (hardcore/fast-paced) I recommend the VG series monitors over the MX! 2ms GTG (average 6ms actual) coupled with a 144Hz refresh rate - flawless!~). Added bonus is watching/playing in 3D also.",3,4
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Great monitor!,2013-03-21,"Pros:It is bright, beautiful, crisp, and the colors are outstanding.  It's also light, thin and incredibly stylish.  The monitor speakers are nothing to write home about, but as far as monitor speakers go they are alright.","Cons:After a few weeks I noticed 6 noticeably dead pixels, and about six or so more that are only really noticeable on white screens, but over all not a HUGE deal.  That is the reason for leaving one egg off.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is great, and I'm extremely pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone.  I do wish that I didn't have any dead pixels, hopefully this is a one time deal with these monitors.  I'll be sending this one back for a replacement.",0,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Monitor is AMAZING But.,2013-03-20,Pros:Quality constructionBeautiful PictureVibrant colorsNo Dead PixelsNo Red lines,Cons:Controls are too sensitiveASUS customer service/support stinksSpeakers are just OK,"Other Thoughts:It is a good thing that ASUS has quality products because their customer service and support stinks!  So I downloaded the INF file for this monitor and just tried to install it from the desktop.  That did not work so I got on IM chat with an ASUS rep.  It took her 20 minutes just to understand my problem. All I wanted to know was how to install the INF color profile; I understand now that you have to do it manually from the Device Manager.  The ASUS rep did not have a clue how to help me and kept on asking questions that I already answered.   So do yourself a favor and do not call or IM customer support.  Trust me. But all that being said you will love this monitor. Also, speakers..you will have to use stand alone desktop speakers if you want true quality sound.  The speakers on this monitor are OK at best.",1,1

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent ASUS monitor,2013-03-13,"Pros:Amazing color accuracy; this monitor has a very wide gamut of color reproduction and is able to replicate colors that other monitors can't.AH-IPS Panel (Advanced High Performance IPS, the most recent variation of IPS technology refined by LG)Excellent contrast ratioVery bright screenPanel has uniform brightness/backlight/color throughoutQuick response time with no noticeable blurring/ghostingNot a hint of light bleedingWide viewing anglesVery nice aesthetic designThin bezel, not truly without a bezel, the screen surface extends past the viewable panel to a thin layer of plastic bezel. Its a very unique look, but still a 1/4"" of non-screen surfaces surrounding the panel.Touch ""buttons""Built in speakers could suffice, but a stand-alone set is highly recommended",Cons:Speakers are unnecessaryMonitor cannot swivel or adjust vertically,"Other Thoughts:My primary use for this monitor is programming, gaming, and watching movies.I purchased this monitor as my primary screen along with another Asus 21.5"" IPS. This monitor puts the other IPS to shame, it’s just that good! I'm thinking I should have bought two of these.I don't do any graphic design/artistic work but I have always been very sensitive to color accuracy. I am now a convert. The newer IPS monitors are really worlds apart from TA/VA panels. Some may or may not notice the difference, but for those that want/need a very color accurate monitor, this is it.Side note: to get the most out of this monitor, head over to lagom.nl/lcd-test/ and calibrate the screen. I set mine on sRGB and it passes all the tests with flying colors. Be sure to use DVI or HDMI. Also be sure to set ""trace free"" to 0 to avoid artifacts for moving scenes.BIG SIDE NOTE: The first one I bought had an eyelash sized hair on the left side of the screen with a cluster of dark pixels on the right side. I RMA'd it and received the current unit (much better!) I didn't take off any eggs, figured it was just a QA anomaly.",9,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Solid Asus product,2013-03-12,"Pros:I was in a market for 27inch+ monitor for sometime and stumbled upon this beauty, decided to pull a trigger on it.  Beautiful looking display, great viewing angles / color display, as well as enough real estate to get your work done if you are not using dual or tri monitor setup.  Monitor resolution at 1920 x 1080 / lack of display port may not be future proof, but for the price you are paying I believe it is a very solid product.When watching a movie, streaming videos the color production is superb, and the wide viewing angle makes it so that I can watch things on a couch or even on my bed without any trouble.I have not encountered any color bleed others have stated.","Cons:Coming from asus vs24inch 2ms monitor, I do notice bit of delay when playing fps games.  It is not significant however if you are a hardcore gamer, this may have negative impact on your gaming.","Other Thoughts:Another solid product from asus! I will be making another purchase of the mx series, when the mx299q is released.",1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,GOOOOOOOD,2013-03-11,Pros:This is the coolest looking monitor I've ever seen! It is gorgeous!I love everything about it,Cons:The speakers are not a good option if you are looking for surround sound but who would expect that from a monitor...,,0,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Too good.,2013-03-11,"Pros:Massive display is all screen, no bulk. The previous Samsung that served this home for 6 years was a beast, but had it's flawed viewing angles and lacked depth. All those flaws are made up here, the viewing angles and adjustable stand help.This screen is perfectly lit with a massive range of colors. In a well lit room and natural light there is no matte glare.Major space saver!","Cons:Being that it's a wider display, and primarily uses HDMI, you do not have as broad a range with PC display resolutions. The 1920x1080 can take getting used to if you're coming down from 1920x1200.Things you thought looked good before, look bland due to the massive difference in detail.If you need speakers in the monitor these are the best I'm sure, but compared to stereo sound or 5.1 and 7.1 surround it's nothing to talk about.","Other Thoughts:Solid for the price, even better if you catch it on a special.",1,1

ASUS,MX32VQ,4,Excellent Monitors,2013-03-08,"Pros:Good IPS technology. Matte finish. Colors are very nice. Scored very well on a monitor test where I looked at different shades of color and contrast/black levels. I was able to distinguish between each shade easily. Price is reasonable.Response time is adequate. I was worried since I have only used low response time panels in the past for gaming. I have a 2ms panel, a 1ms panel and now two of these 5ms IPS monitors. I was going to primarily use them for working and watching movies. However, I did test them out on some games and found no problem gaming on them. I've played Crysis 2, BF3, SC2, XCOM, and a few others so far. They all played perfectly, and I did not detect ghosting. In fact, the colors were better and I prefer to use them for games now.","Cons:Backlight bleed along the corners at off-center viewing angles. Only really noticeable on an all black screen. It spreads the worse the viewing angle (from the corners). It's a bit different than standard bleed from an TN panel (explained below). I assume that's because of the new IPS tech.For example, to remove the bleed from the lower right corner you'd have to position your eyes directly in front of that corner (wouldn't do anything to a TN panel's light bleed, but works here), which worsens the bleed from the rest of the monitor. Overall, It has wide viewing angles for which an image can be identified with some light bleed on the corners. Not much of a downside considering the price. Doesn't impact my use at all.The bottom silver strip that adds style to the design prevents using eyefinity for gaming. It is taller than the rest of the bezel making it impossible to do multiple monitors in portrait configuration. The fact that the silver part is also a little wider than the bezel leaves a small (1mm) gap when doing landscape configurations. I didn't have any intention of using it for this purpose.The ""alignment grid"" ""feature"" is freakin annoying. I mean, seriously ANNOYING. The buttons are along the bottom of the monitor and very touch sensitive. I accidentally hit them all the time when moving something on my desk or adjusting the volume for my speakers. I seem to hit the ""alignment grid"" the most. It is a 15+ second ordeal to get rid of it. It's meant to be used for making 3x5 note cards and the like. Nifty idea. It overlays onto the screen, with some transparency. It also has several ""pages"" that all have to be flipped through to get it to turn off. But, ALL the pages have to be flipped through and it takes a few seconds for it to flip between pages. Meaning, after you accidentally hit the button you're sitting there spamming the button through each of these pages to get the overlay to go away. And there's no way to skip it and just turn it off. It would be fatal during any kind of gaming. Worst Software Design Decision. Evar. I mean, when is it ever a good idea to not have an 'esc' button? 1 Egg down!","Other Thoughts:I have two of these monitors and this is my second review. I verified everything I said above with both. Originally I couldn't because of the color difference I noticed between them. However, the color problem was fixed when I switched to ""active"" adapters on my Radeon 6970. I recommend investing in these adapters if you plan on using multiple monitors. The difference was night and day. There is still a very minor color difference, but easily correct with adjustments.The ""trace free"" feature cases artifacts! At first I thought my video card was dying. Pixels would go bright solid, r,g or b. This turned out to be the ""trace free"" feature that Asus included to lower response time for games. It is set at 60% by default and causes no artifacts at that setting. At 100% artifacts occur due to rapid on-screen movement.I would recommend this over the 27"" version as the light bleed phenomena would probably be worse.",7,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent Picture Quality,2013-03-07,Pros:Excellent picture quality -- great contrast and definition.  Crysis 3 looks fabulous with no signs of lag or ghosting.  Very uniform screen brightness from edge to center.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I don't really see an advantage of this IPS display for viewing angle over my other conventional monitors.,1,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,1,Second RMA,2013-03-05,"Pros:Gorgeous displayNot truly frameless, but closePhenomenal color reproductionGood response time","Cons:I received my first one and it was great for a couple of weeks. However, then I started getting a random red line a pixel wide going the entire width of the screen from top to bottom. Sometimes this line was blue or green as well. Pressing gently on the back would make it temporarily go away. ASUS support told me it is not an uncommon issue, so...I submitted for an RMA. I just set up the new one...and it has the red grid mentioned in other reviews. I expect more from ASUS and I am incredibly disappointed.Of course they can't control this part, but the UPS store is not convenient for me and now I have to make TWO trips.","Other Thoughts:Unfortunately, I would say stay away from this monitor until ASUS improves their quality control. Absolutely unacceptable for a $350 monitor; especially from a company with such a strong reputation.It's heartbreaking because it really is a beautiful display.",3,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,2,Going with something else,2013-03-04,"Pros:Actual monitor is aesthetically pleasingComing from a TN panel the colors were exceptionalBig 27""Dual HDMI is nice","Cons:No DVI, DisplayPortLight bleed was noticeable, but expected from a IPSI had the red grid problem other reviewers have noted",Other Thoughts:RMA due to red grid problem and some funky issue with red and green lines blinking in and out when watching videos/games. I already knew about the red grid so I didn't put much effort in finding out what could be causing it. Does not happen with older monitor plugged in.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,It gets the job done,2013-03-04,"Pros:- The monitor itself is sexy. The bezel is pretty thin.- Over HDMI (I'm using a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter), the colors are vibrant and the display is still pretty bright despite the anti-glare.- The packaging was nice.","Cons:- The speakers are mediocre. My 13"" laptop speakers are better. In particular, from the audio in, there is hardly treble (which is the opposite of what you'd expect), and there's no way to adjust it. The HDMI seems to have more balanced audio though.- There's no way to select the audio input channel. So even if you want to use HDMI with the audio in.. you're out of luck. For the most part this shouldn't be a problem.- Beyond that, the audio out has very low volume. If I plug my headphones into it, I have to turn the volume way up to have the volume level be equivalent to the speaker volume.- This may be the fault of the adapter (though none of the 300+ reviews of it mentioned), but over VGA (from mini-displayport), colors look more washed out and everything seems less bright (grayer) than over HDMI. So I have to turn the contrast up while using VGA to make it appear similar.- The viewing angles aren't amazing. In particular, the bottom left corner appears brighter/bluer than the rest of the screen from where I sit at my desk. This is only noticeable with dark backgrounds and if you're within a couple feet of the monitor though. I program with a dark background at my desk, so it's a slight nuisance.","Other Thoughts:- The touch menu buttons are odd, but you get used to them.- Though there are a lot of them, the negatives mostly pertain to audio issues, which are of course not that important to a display. it's cheap, thin, and looks good over HDMI. So as a display, it meets my expectations. My main qualm is with the lack of settings for the audio, especially given the advertising / branding of it. If you have a separate audio system, then this doesn't even matter. The other problem is with the VGA in, though that may just be the fault of the adapter. And the reason I use VGA in in the first place is because the mini-displayport out from my laptop doesn't support audio. If you're just using HDMI, it looks great.",1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great monitor!,2013-03-02,Pros:Huge display compared to my old 19in hp monitor.The screen looks really good (even when turned off).No ghosting to be seen.,Cons:The monitor's buttons feel a little too sensitive for my taste but for most it shouldn't be a problem.,Other Thoughts:For to the $230 range of monitors this has to be one of the best I've seen.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,4,,2013-03-02,"Pros:- High quality build- Nice colors. Pleasing to look at after adjusted.- Minimal ghosting- It's rather thin and light, I like that.","Cons:- I personally find the 'touch buttons' that allow you to adjust the settings far too sensitive -- it's annoying to change the settings and bothers my wrist holding it in the position under the monitor after a while as well.- The monitor is very bright and when dimming it with the brightness setting, the colors become a bit washed out. So it's hard to balance between good colors and not being overly bright. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like my monitors being intensely bright.- There is some minor ghosting that I mostly see while scrolling fast through a web site for example, but I found that leaving the ""trace free"" option on 20 instead of the default 60 makes it less noticeable. I don't notice ghosting in games, however, so that's good.","Other Thoughts:I used to have a Hanns.G 281DJB, and the colors on this monitor as much more accurate and diverse. I feel like I was missing something when I compare to my old one.With an ATI card I had to override a registry editing to stop it from overscanning and displaying the 1920x1080 / HD resolution with black borders around it on the screen. But this does not appear to be a fault of the monitor; it seems ATI drivers detect it as a TV instead of a monitor or something. But now it works great.",1,0

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great Monitor,2013-02-22,"Pros:IPS, matte finish, stylish design.  I didn't notice the higher response time when playing Crysis (I have a 2ms panel to compare to). Resonable price.","Cons:It's not a perfect display, but it also doesn't have the price tag of one. Definitely a good buy if you get a decent one. One of the monitors I bought seems defective (see below).","Other Thoughts:I ordered 2, and the colors looked pretty different (I did factory resets and made sure they were both configured identically). I ran some image tests. One of the monitors was significantly brighter with 'white' having a yellowish tint. It was painful to the eye to use at full brightness - wouldn't have been a problem if turning the brightness down hadn't made 'whites' even more yellowish.The other monitor wasn't quite as bright, but whites were purer and weren't painful. It did better overall on the tests I did, especially contrast. Definitely a fantastic monitor.I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't bought 2. I knew that 2 identical monitors would be a little different, but the difference is obvious, especially when looking at my desktop.",4,0

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Awesome Monitor,2013-02-20,Pros:BIG and great colors!  HDMI and the sound is a bonus if you don't have speakers otherwise its not worth using.  Sexy looks and small form factor.  No dead pixels or weird bar of red pixels people have commented about.,Cons:Always can be cheaper but this price was pretty reasonable for the size.  When the screen is ALL black you see a little light bleed but its minor and not a big deal to me.,Other Thoughts:If you plan on using 2 of these make sure you have a LARGE desk... i was considering it but with 2 of these I'd need to buy a new desk and look side to side to view the whole thing.,0,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Beautiful Monitor,2013-02-20,"Pros:Thin designThin bezelBuilt in speakers2 HDMI portsThis monitor was a great buy. Replaced 2 ASUS monitors that did not really need replacing but I needed more space on my desk. The colors are very rich and bright, and comes with many built in settings.The bezel is not razor thin, but it is thin. Using 2 or 3 of these would still be better than one with a thick bezel.The frameless design looks really cool, makes the monitor very unique.IPS lets you view it from very good angles, although I will most likely be viewing from right in front, its nice to have it that way though.",Cons:None I can think of so far.,"Other Thoughts:Would be nice if it was 2 or 1ms response time, which ASUS makes a monitor with 1ms response time and still a thin bezel for cheaper than this one.",2,0

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great IPS for the price,2013-02-19,"Pros:Great color, contrast and nice blacks, if you're NOT using the provided DVI to HDMI cable. Really an amazing monitor for the price and definitely a step above the average ASUS LED monitors (I own several). Great for graphic design.","Cons:Not a huge con, but the provided DVI to HDMI creates washed out colors and blacks. I was very disappointed until I found the issue. Use DVI to VGA. I haven't tested HDMI to HDMI.",,2,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Great Display,2013-02-18,"Pros:The monitor looks great, and the thin bezel is nice (sort-of). It is very sturdy and it easily adjusted. Its IPS. It has good sound (for the size and being a monitor) if you choose to use it. Colors and contrast are great.",Cons:I do like that it has a very thin bezel but dont let this fool you. It still has a border. It is a thin border but from the description it makes it sound like there is almost no border because of the thin bezel but there is. It is still a great monitor and not worth the subtraction of an egg..,Other Thoughts:Already have one I got locally and cant wait for the second so I can use a 3 monitor setup.,1,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Beaut,2013-02-18,"Pros:Everything looks great on this monitor. Games, movies, applications you name it. I play Starcraft II, LoL, Guild Wars 2 and it just makes everything pop.Has 2 HDMI slots which is awesome.The monitor is so light weight. Usually with these bigger monitors they have some heft to them, but this weights practically nothing. It is also ultra thin. I was surprised when I received it.The monitor goes almost all the way to the frame. There is maybe an inch of thin bezel. This monitor just looks awesome. I have it in the middle of my Asus 24"" monitors. Now I may have to pick up two of these to replace the 24s!",Cons:No DVI just like everyone stated. It does come with an HDMI to DVI cord.No mounting holes at all. Kind of a bummer as I was planning on setting up a mounting system.

ASUS,MX32VQ,3,Some issues...not sure if it's just a random issue or not,2013-02-15,"Pros:Beautiful looking displace. I replaced my iMac and this is what I chose to at least make a suitable replacement aesthetic wise. Looks great, love the anti-glare coating.","Cons:Something I noticed as soon as I took it out of the box, is that in the bottom middle (on the screen, above where the ASUS logo is positioned), is a grid of red dots. I assume this is a result of some light source behind the screen, or something, as it is quite uniform. It's a half-circle, where the rounded edge is above the bezel.I thought maybe it was just random, and then I Googled it, and there is someone on YouTube with the issue actually on video for this exact monitor (just search YouTube for ""MX279H red grid"").Still weighing my options. It's not overly noticeable in bright environments or scenes, however, if you have anything dark (dark grey, black, blues, etc.) there is red points all over the image.","Other Thoughts:It has some blooming/flashlighting in the corners, but, I'm used to such things with my LED television I basically ignore it.",5,0

ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Pretty darn good monitor,2013-02-14,"Pros:Matte Screen, Thin Bezel, Attractive monitor and stand, AH-IPS (newest ips technology), thin, decent speakers (i also have a sony $200+ sound bar which emulates surround, so obviously that's better but these speakers are decent for a thin panel, I wouldn't mind using them as a primary source of sound)","Cons:Can't swivel left or right, no vesa mounts (doesn't matter to me at the moment though), hdmi only but comes with hdmi to dvi cable (which strangely transfers sound, not sure but everywhere i looked said this shouldn't be happening) also for me, maybe for me only, touch buttons can be a bit annoying at times, the power doesn't always come on when i touch it, sometimes I do a tap dance in that area with my finger to get it to register, although it works fine most of the time","Other Thoughts:Pretty good IPS panel for the price. No bleed as far as I could tell and no dead pixels. Played a bit of Dead Space 3 on it, didn't really notice any ghosting or lag. Watched a couple of videos on it too, looked pretty good. After buying this I don't really see why people go gaga over IPS though, I work with a TN panel and my tv is a VA panel, and IMO, there isn't a large difference between them. I have this and my tv for a dual monitor setup, and by comparison, my tv (lg 37"" led/lcd) has better blacks, TN is the cheapest, and IPS is mildly better than the other two at color accuracy and sharpness but has a VASTLY better viewing angle. So yea if those three things are MUST for you, and what I really mean is if viewing angle is important to you, go with IPS, otherwise, go with TN for a cheaper price. And considering this is AH-IPS, I would go with this over the dells which cost considerably more.",5,0
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Amazing..,2013-02-14,"Pros:Amazing design, the overall feel of the monitor is quality and not some cheap product.The picture quality is fantastic as was expected.

It might just be me.Doesn't change my opinion on the monitor at all, I'm still in love.",0,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Nice!,2013-02-10,"Pros:B-E-A-utiful Screen. No light bleed. No dead pixels.No noticeable ghosting when playing fps games, but then again I'm not a pro gamer. Perfect for what I needed/wanted. Great viewing angles. I came from a 22 inch 2ms 16:10 Samsung Syncmaster and I am a huge fan of the extra real estate you get with that aspect ratio. I initially purchased an Asus PA248Q for roughly the same price. Gorgeous monitor too, but I am glad It had dead pixels because I wouldnt have returned it and found this monitor. It has a slightly better framerate and has an IPS screen as well, though it can't be rotated like the other one but that wasn't a deal breaker for me. The MX279H has an aspect ratio of 16:9 compared to the 16:10 of the PA248Q, but it's a 27 inch screen as opposed to 24. Aesthetically the monitor looks so clean compared to others. None of that boring matte or over glossed black. The accents and finish are tasteful and the only glossy finish is on the back of the monitor. The base is solid but doesn't rotate which might be a factor for some, for me not so much. All in all wonderful monitor for its price/features/size.",Cons:No DVI input. But comes with a DVI to HDMI cable anyway. Looks just as great.Buttons are not physical. They are nubs that are touch sensitive. I got used to them quick.,"Other Thoughts:I've played around with the settings, and personally I think the factory set the brightness a little too high.I set it to sRGB mode and prefer that as my default setup because of the more accurate colors.Would probably pick up two more, but I would need a bigger desk, oh and a new video card or two!!!",0,1
ASUS,MX32VQ,5,Excellent!,2013-02-08,"Pros:First, the overall design of this monitor is striking. From the sundial inspired base to the frameless screen, it looks more like a work of art. When turned on, there is only about a 1/4 inch of black around the edge of the screen. The colors and vibrancy were perfect right out of the box. Images just seem to ""pop."" I've seen other monitors that were a bit shaky. Monitor tilts to adjust the viewing angle and is still quite stable.","Cons:I utilize a separate sound system, so it does not matter, but I did try the built in speakers to see how they were. Given the slim design of the screen, what can one expect? They sound a bit thin, but for their size, if you had to use them, they are okay.","Other Thoughts:Bottom line: I am completely satisfied with this purchase. The Newegg price was great. I cannot imagine how I could be any more pleased nor could I really point to anything that I would improve. This monitor also has a companion 27"" just like it. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone. Also, Newegg's service was great! Shipped fast and it actually arrived a day earlier than originally projected. Thank you!",4,0

ASUS,VG245H,4,"Great Monitor, but needs configuration first",2019-02-08,"Pros:The image on this screen is very bright and clear (once you have adjusted the settings).  While the adjustments and power buttons are on the back (to reduce frame width), they are intuitive enough that I did not find myself needing to check which button I was using.  The little joystick for the control is also a plus.The image is also very clear compared to my previous LG display; I had to find a better background image for both my Windows and Unbuntu PCs as I can now see any flaws in the images I was using previously.  Video playback is also very nice...I'm not using the speakers (I have a nice external setup already), so the options in the menu to turn the volume off is appreciated.","Cons:Did I say this display was bright?  Out of the box, it is actually way too bright; the first thing you'll want to do is to change the mode and adjust the brightness/contrast, otherwise it'll appear washed out.  It took me 20-30 minutes to finally find the settings I was happiest with (mind you, I can be a little OCD...) but the settings you want will be there.I also ran into an issue getting this set up with Windows 10; ASUS has not created a driver for this display, and the Generic PNP only allows for a max of 60mhz.  Trying create a custom profile using the Radeon drivers didn't work either.  My display is on a KVM with a second PC running Unbuntu, and I was able to set the display to 74.99mhz and use all the features on that PC, which leads me to suspect this is more of a Windows/driver issue than an issue with the display or my current cabling setup.","Other Thoughts:As mentioned, I have no plans on using the built-in speakers, so I can't really give any feedback regarding that.  Also, I haven't run any games yet either (I just replaced my main PC so only my productivity apps are installed so far), but will be planning to do so soon.Overall I would recommend this display, but only to someone who either is savvy enough to configure the settings out of the box, or has someone available that can do it for them.",0,4

It has decent colors, great response, better refresh rate, the speakers don't sound like a dollar store headset from 5 meters away, not that you should ever use either of them in the first place, and the overall quality is pretty high.I haven't had a single problem with it, other than the colors right out of the box. None of the presets look even remotely good but within a minute I had it set up as close to realistic as possible. If this is your budget and micro center doesn't have some ridiculous deal going on, get this one. It's surprisingly well worth the price. Bought Nov 2017 and not a single dead pixel yet.",1,1

However, so far so good because of the following:- The monitor was delivered earlier than I expected.- Lots of options to help optimized the clarity or brightness you want.- The stand that it comes with is such a relief. I can adjust and tilt the direction of where I want to watch.- Easy to set up and connected with my laptop no problem via HDMI- I can finally compare two word documents within the same screen area and still be able to read.",Cons:- The speakers are not that great but it is an added bonus if you don't have any source for sound.,"Other Thoughts:I am really happy with this monitor so far.

ASUS,VG245H,5,Go ASUS!,2017-02-24,Pros:I am beyond satisfied with these amazing ASUS monitors. I was going to originally get IPS monitors but I'm Glad I went with these. This is the first item I've ever purchased from Newegg and selected the free shipping option that mentioned about 5 business days and my shipment came in the next day! I was blown away at how fast my shipment arrived. I highly recommend these monitors.My favorite thing about this monitor is how it is able to be positioned any way you won't which is super convenient and I purchased 2 of these bad boys!,Cons:Nothing that I can think of. Great product for a great price. I got them on sale for $169.99 ea.,"Other Thoughts:If you are checking out this monitor, look no further this will fulfill all your needs :)",3,0
ASUS,VG245H,4,"Great Monitor, but needs configuration first",2019-02-08,"Pros:The image on this screen is very bright and clear (once you have adjusted the settings).  While the adjustments and power buttons are on the back (to reduce frame width), they are intuitive enough that I did not find myself needing to check which button I was using.  The little joystick for the control is also a plus.The image is also very clear compared to my previous LG display; I had to find a better background image for both my Windows and Unbuntu PCs as I can now see any flaws in the images I was using previously.  Video playback is also very nice...I'm not using the speakers (I have a nice external setup already), so the options in the menu to turn the volume off is appreciated.","Cons:Did I say this display was bright?  Out of the box, it is actually way too bright; the first thing you'll want to do is to change the mode and adjust the brightness/contrast, otherwise it'll appear washed out.  It took me 20-30 minutes to finally find the settings I was happiest with (mind you, I can be a little OCD...) but the settings you want will be there.I also ran into an issue getting this set up with Windows 10; ASUS has not created a driver for this display, and the Generic PNP only allows for a max of 60mhz.  Trying create a custom profile using the Radeon drivers didn't work either.  My display is on a KVM with a second PC running Unbuntu, and I was able to set the display to 74.99mhz and use all the features on that PC, which leads me to suspect this is more of a Windows/driver issue than an issue with the display or my current cabling setup.","Other Thoughts:As mentioned, I have no plans on using the built-in speakers, so I can't really give any feedback regarding that.  Also, I haven't run any games yet either (I just replaced my main PC so only my productivity apps are installed so far), but will be planning to do so soon.Overall I would recommend this display, but only to someone who either is savvy enough to configure the settings out of the box, or has someone available that can do it for them.",0,4
ASUS,VG245H,5,Pleased overall,2019-02-06,Pros:Price pointControlsVESA MountOriginal Stand75hz Refresh RateDecent colors,Cons:Stock Color Configuration,"Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor because of my budget, it was the only monitor (at the time) that fit my needs. It has decent colors, great response, better refresh rate, the speakers don't sound like a dollar store headset from 5 meters away, not that you should ever use either of them in the first place, and the overall quality is pretty high.I haven't had a single problem with it, other than the colors right out of the box. None of the presets look even remotely good but within a minute I had it set up as close to realistic as possible. If this is your budget and micro center doesn't have some ridiculous deal going on, get this one. It's surprisingly well worth the price. Bought Nov 2017 and not a single dead pixel yet.",1,1
ASUS,VG245H,5,GREAT STARTER MONITOR,2019-01-06,"Pros:I've been mostly using my monitor for watching Netflix, browsing the internet, office work. However, I haven't really played any games to test the game visuals. However, so far so good because of the following:- The monitor was delivered earlier than I expected.- Lots of options to help optimized the clarity or brightness you want.- The stand that it comes with is such a relief. I can adjust and tilt the direction of where I want to watch.- Easy to set up and connected with my laptop no problem via HDMI- I can finally compare two word documents within the same screen area and still be able to read.",Cons:- The speakers are not that great but it is an added bonus if you don't have any source for sound.,"Other Thoughts:I am really happy with this monitor so far.

ASUS,VG245H,4,Good monitor,2018-05-08,"Pros:Good looking monitor, gets the job gone for someone on a budget. 75hz wich is still better than 60hz.

A wide screen is also the great part too, it has a smooth simple appearance besides the back it has some cool engraving that I will never see because it's facing my wall.

ASUS,VG245H,1,Contrast changes dramatically at any viewing angle,2017-07-16,"Pros:Overall build quality, like the stand.  The menu navigation works better than any display I've used.","Cons:The picture quality is overall pretty terrible due to the high variation in contrast across the screen. It's about 1.5 feet from my face in portrait (vertial) orientation.  The left of the display is lighter than the right of the display, particularly when I have dark images (e.g. my code editor using a dark color palette).  When white page with text is displayed, it's even worse since the right side looks orange'y.  It's barely tolerable; I mostly want to use it to edit code.  AFAICT the display options don't make this any better.As anticipated, the speaker is terrible too.","Other Thoughts:I would not purchase this again, and I'm debating returning it.",2,12

ASUS,VG245H,5,ASUS VG245H,2017-01-21,"Pros:I have had these screens for several months now and I love them. I was just going to pick up 3 cheap 1080p screens for my Nvidia surround setup but I saw these were only a couple bucks more so I opted for them. You wouldn't think there is a huge difference between 75hz and 60hz but its very noticeable on games you can push that high. They are light so they were east mount.However, the best part about buying these and the main reason that inspired me to write this review was Newegg. I don't know how they ever sell expedited shipping because each time I ordered one of these with the 5 to 7 day shipping it arrived in 2 business days. I live in an apartment building and each time they brought them to my doorstep instead of the front of the building. I have yet to have a bad experience with Newegg.",Cons:The only cons for these are typical TN panel issues. The colors aren't great next to an IPS but if its not there for comparison you don't notice.

ASUS,VG245H,5,Excellent for PC gaming,2016-12-11,"Pros:I bought this strictly for PC gaming. I do have a PS4 and it does work with it using the second HDMI port but I hooked it back up to my TV (I use my PS4 for couch gaming). This review will be strictly based on my gaming with an AMD RX480 paired with this monitor.AESTHETICS AND BUILD:Very sturdy monitor. I build computers for people and include a monitor when I do so I have seen a number of different monitors. This monitor has the most sturdy stand I have seen. It is very tightly built and doesn't wobble whatsoever. The ""tightness"" does make the swivel a little difficult to push side to side but I would much rather have that then a wobbly monitor stand. The screen also tilts both directions unlike most monitors only turning one direction. I never use this feature but it is there. The design of the monitor is also very nice with the back of it having a rugged futuristic looking style to it. It also has a nice thin bezel around the screen which makes it look sleek.One thing I don't like is the cable organizing hole on the stand. It's strange and hard to explain but the wires are tough to get through. It's not that big of a deal though.CONTROLS AND FEATURES:The on screen menu and settings are pretty good. Doesn't have the most settings in the world but it does anything most people need it to do plus some extra gaming features. There is a nice FPS counter overlay built into the monitor which I like. The menu is controlled with a little joystick on the back which is fantastic and quick to use unlike having multiple buttons instead.FreeSync is easy to turn on and works fantastic with my AMD RX480. Screen tearing is eliminated entirely and looks super smooth. The RX480 will also power any game out today at this monitors resolution. This is good because if you go below 40fps the monitor no longer does freesync (freesync range is 40-75hz).SCREEN:This is a 1920x1080 TN panel screen and as such doesn't have the greatest color accuracy. However, having used many TN panels in the past, this is one of the better ones, if not the best one, I have used in regards to color. The out of the box colors aren't spectacular so I suggest adjusting those though. If you are not using this monitor for gaming, I recommend getting an IPS display.Also, the brightness is SUPER bright. I have it set at 35% brightness and it's still pretty bright. I like a bright monitor though. The screen also has a refresh rate of 75hz unlike most monitors which are 60hz. That means it's slightly faster in regards to displaying images (can display 75 frames a second).PERFORMANCE:I currently use this monitor for Overwatch, Fallout 4, Battlefield 1, and Battlerite. Freesync is great for gaming and makes everything smooth. It works flawlessly with all 4 of these games that I have played on it so far. Also, the monitor has low input lag.OVERALL:Fantastic monitor for gaming but not so much for anything else. 10/10 for TN panel monitors and gaming. Highly recommend.",Cons:See above,Other Thoughts:See above,11,0

Color was all crazy strange so I had to fiddle with the settings but got it to a comfortable spot. Runs smooth and looks good for a TN. 1ms is awesome and I can tell coming from a 5ms 1080p IPS screen. The unit itself looks amazing, Bezel is slim and flush within 1 millimeter of the screen and the 75hz helps smooth out the games you can get 75+ fps on.","Cons:If you're coming off a IPS like I did then I would get a better IPS monitor and not go with the aging TN tech. Its noticeable enough but does not bother me. viewing angles are noticeable but that is to be expected. Other then playing with the settings for color, contrast and brightness through the monitors options and Nvidia's options I got this thing looking better then out of box. -1 Star.",Other Thoughts:I grabbed this on sale for $179 USD.

ASUS,VG245H,5,Fantastic Gaming Monitor for the Price,2016-09-23,Pros:-Bright clear screen-No perceptible input lag. Twitch FPS like Doom will run like a dream-Host of extra features of varying value. You probably won't use all the extra options but the addition of so many has great cumulative value.-75hz refresh is great for gaming and regular use.-Much better than expected viewing angles for a TN panel.-Much better color representation than most TN panels.-Outstanding ergonomic options. You can set this thing up in every conceivable position.-Free Sync works as well if not better than advertised.-No ghosting no artifacts-OSD controls are laid out well and easy to access.-Packaging was fantastic and it took 5 seconds to assemble-Solid construction and looks like a premium monitor.,"Cons:-Out of the box settings are pretty terrible. Reducing the contrast, brightness and some of the color calmed things down a lot.-Enabling Free Sync was not covered in the quick guide in fact nothing was provided in the guide at all. A quick search on the web provided the results but something letting me know where to find the option in the sub menu would have been nice.",Other Thoughts:Love this monitor. Coming from a Dell S2415H ISP monitor that had a brilliant picture and was amazing for work but lagged so much it made gaming impossible. The VG245H doesn't have the brilliant picture of a solid IPS but is better in every other way. At the sub $200 range there aren't any other monitors even close to this one and I cannot recommend it enough. Best TN monitor I have ever owned by far.,6,0
ASUS,VG245H,5,Amazing monitor for the price. Buy it...,2016-09-15,"Pros:- Anti-glare coating just right.- No shiny plastics, all matte black- Solid construction, very good height adjustable stand, similar to Asus higher end ROG series. No wobble during heavy gaming.- Control stick to make changes to monitor is intuitive and easy to use. OSD isn't laggy. All features easy to access.- Can create four separate profiles and easily switch between them- Speakers actually pretty decent (loud and clear).- No dead or stuck pixels.- After calibration image quality excellent, very good contrast- No noticeable input lag (I'm a quake player and sensitive to this), very responsive during gaming.- No noticeable ghosting. Default overdrive of 60 is adequate and doesn't cause noticeable image trailing.- Runs at 75Hz over HDMI natively. No hacks or tricks needed. Just select from control panel. Freesync does not need to be on.- Freesync over HDMI- Viewing angles surprisingly better than expected where you can sit back a bit and play with an XBOX controller with friends.- Typical TN washout reduced due to viewing angles.- Gaming is a pleasure on this monitor. Tried a variety of games and for a TN panel the colour and contrast really surprised me.- Almost half the price (when on sale) of a decent 24"" 144Hz Freesync monitor.- Thin bezels and small footprint. Fits in tight spots and great if you don't have a lot of desk space.- Multiple blue light filter adjustments, no tired eyes after lengthy gaming sessions.- 75Hz surprisingly much better than 60hz, even in Windows doing mundane tasks.- Freesync range larger than most monitors in this class at 40 - 75hz.","Cons:- Out of box image settings are terrible. Brightness and colours all wrong and washed out. Why monitors are shipped this way I will never understand. Luckily 10 minutes in the control panel you can easily fix this if you make the correct changes.- Minor backlight unevenness near the bezels. Not noticeable mid game but can see it if you look for it.- IPS displays definitely have better colour, but not as much as I expected. Don't use for colour critical work.","Other Thoughts:Yes I recommend this monitor, especially if you're a gamer on a budget and can catch it on sale. I also own a much more premium monitor.The 144Hz IPS Freesync 27"" MG279Q which is 3x the price but not really worth 3x more if you're just a gamer. 24"" at 1080P is the sweet spot for TN. Any larger and the TN viewing angles start to rear the ugly side of the technology. 1080P is relatively easy to drive with a budget card like the new Radeon 460 on medium to high settings but I would recommend at least a 470 if you can afford it for the extra VRAM and the ability to max out most games. However a Freesync range of 40 - 75Hz does not require the fastest CPU. That's the beauty of Freesync at lower refresh rates, spend a little more on the monitor and can get away with a cheaper processor. You can build a budget PC around this monitor and still have an extremely good gaming system with no tearing.As a former competitive Quake player *you can play competitively on this monitor* which surprised me TBH. 75Hz with no perceptible input lag (10ms on average out paces the max refresh rate) and no ghosting allows you to play very fast paced games such as CS:GO or Quake or Rocket League. This monitor will not hold you back. Playing Quake Live between this budget monitor and my 144Hz MG279Q I didn't feel like I was at any kind of significant disadvantage due to the reduced refresh rate. This could be due to the TN vs IPS differences (1ms vs 4ms) but either way the VG245H is perfectly serviceable for competitive gamers.",29,2

TWO HUGE CRACKS OUT OF THE BOX!,2018-09-10,Pros:None,"Cons:Product arrived with two gigantic vertical cracks as well as a smaller horizontal one, rendering the monitor useless. I am unable to return it for some reason even though it is covered by the 15 day return policy and I recieved the product only today. What a horrible experience it has been!

Acer,UM.UE2AA.A01,2,Decent value but nothing amazing,2018-08-30,"Pros:-144hz (though flickers above 120)-VA with ok colors-Overall looks nice-Price, very cheap ($160)","Cons:-Must press button for 5-6 seconds to turn off monitor-Cannot run at 144hz, have to turn down to 120 to prevent screen flickering-After waking up computer from sleep the resolution occasionally gets set to something like 480p or 240p instead of 1080p, must power cycle monitor to resolve-Does not seem to have great drivers for Windows 10","Other Thoughts:Overall it is a step up from the 60hz TN panel monitor I previously had. Color quality does not seem that much better(if at all) which is disappointing but partly expected. It is very annoying that if settings get reset for any reason the screen starts to flicker and I have to set the refresh rate back to 120hz to resolve. Additionally a few times a week the resolution gets messed up and requires turning monitor off and on to resolve. I have tried updating drivers, firmware, etc but cannot resolve these two points. Only thing I have not done is buy a better quality DP cable to see if that is the cause of some of my issues.If I were to buy a monitor again I would probably not get this one as my goal was to get something nicer than my previous monitor. While this is a slight upgrade it is not a very noticeable one and for a little bit more $$ I could have found a higher quality monitor that would make a bigger difference. This was Very cheap when on sale(and goes on sale every other month) but I would never recommend this monitor when not on sale.For those looking into this, I would say go for it if you really don't have a large budget and you want 144hz VA. If you want nice 144hz I would spend a bit more for a higher quality VA/IPS monitor or do some research and get a nice 144hz TN panel for same price or less. I don't feel the screen quality is a selling point so if that is at all important to you then I recommend looking elsewhere and know that this monitor does not seem plug and play friendly as many others have pointed out issues getting the screen to behave.",0,3

The difference between the two wasn't too noticeable, colors were great. At the time I got this monitor for 169.99 it was a good deal for what it was.",Cons:I had a problem with the screen flickering like if there was a faulty bulb inside. It wasn't noticeable unless you were you had dark colors on your screen. It didn't bother me much since I used the monitor mainly for gaming and it didn't show in the titles I was playing.The monitor ending up getting the LCD cracked on the inside when my microphone hit against it. It sounded like a light knock against the screen but it ended up taking it out. This may just be my fault but I wanted to let some know that this monitor can't take a beating if you move your setup a lot.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend picking this monitor if it's on sale if it's 179.99 or below.

Leans towards subtle side, which I appreciate)- 144hz, low response times (games are wonderful on this, CS:GO included)- Accepts DVI, HDMI, and Displayport- Comes with displayport cable- Great price (bought at ~$160)- Not many adjustments needed, just turned brightness down","Cons:- None really as of yet- Some wobble that is due to the joint, yet the base is very secure. Nothing major- Uses a power brick, which isn't ideal but doesn't ruin anything for me- No VESA","Other Thoughts:Very impressed and content with this. If you're like me, and iffy about the idea of a curve on a monitor this small, let me tell you in my opinion it was designed very well.

I’m not a picture snob so I just used a preset with some tweaking to the brightness.Anti-glare or at least limited glare screen.","Cons:Holy dust magnet.Alt-tabbing frequently crashed the display driver and would make the picture on the screen very fuzzy. Have to restart PC and the monitor to restore image.Very strange tilt locations, faces pretty much all the way down at the stock setting. Not really bad but it is weird.Power button takes way too long. 6-7 seconds to turn the monitor off.","Other Thoughts:Overall it’s a good monitor. The display issues I’m having may be due to the cable (just used the DisplayPort cable that came with it) but I’m not sure. It has decent picture, and it’s 144hz. When I bought it, it was on sale and I only paid ~$167 so no complaint on the pricing. 1080p at this refresh rate is a super nice combo, and as long as you have the horsepower to push it, definitely recommended. I have a GTX 980 and a lot of games will run at 144fps no problem, but newer ones require lower settings, which is fine. I’m willing to sacrifice visual quality for those buttery smooth frames. Wish it was a G-Sync panel and not FreeSync, but I’m not gonna complain. I give this monitor 7.8/10.",3,1

I personally prefer a VA panel to IPS for the latency. The color gamut is perfectly within even above average user needs remembering this is a high refresh monitor. I'm not trying to color match a photo edit, I'm trying to outpace an incoming headshot. The curviture is in the sweet spot for a 24"" to provide that slight depth of field augmentation to actually become noticibly more immersive to a flat panel display. The brightness is almost blinding on a white screen at night when maxed, so if you prefer a brighter scale option this is in your grasp. You also don't lose color gamut by lowering brightness to a more reasonable lumen level as I do.My final thought has little to do with this model, and moreover that I don't believe we should be at $200+ for a 24"" monitor. I bought this under $190 during Cyber Monday 2017 and even still I feel like the mid grade display market is out of sorts. IMO we should be paying an MSRP of $175 for a 24"" curved VA panel pushing 144Hz from a decent manufacturer. IPS, OLED, QLED; fine, okay, I get the price point, but TN and VA panels mass produced should not be warranting the price point they are marketing these for the MSRP. I'd almost assume that part of that overhead has to do with FreeSync licensing, which does anyone actually tolerate the inherent latency from G-Sync and FreeSync on their monitors to enable it? I guess maybe for... Civilization? Minecraft?If you can snag it between $190-210 in early 2018 it still has a decent to good value proposition. I do very much approve of mine. It's my daily driver next to a 55"" 4k OLED that I use for productivity. I have zero complaints aside from the size which was my choice. Would prefer to have had a slightly higher price and gotten a 28-32"" instead but we're hundreds of dollars more for those.",13,2

A Pixel will appear black at the very top left corner at 144hz, however if you switch to 120hz the pixel issue should resolve itself and all should be fine, seems to be an issue with AMD Freesync as I had one monitor replaced already with the exact same issue.","Other Thoughts:I had this monitor replaced once already its a great monitor, I just wish that the 144hz would have worked out of the box without the annoying pixel issue.",1,0

This is amazingly cheap for the specs. Sadly, I have an Nvidia card so I can't utilize the FreeSync. HOWEVER, FREESYNC WILL NOT MESS UP YOUR NVIDIA CARD, AND G-SYNC WILL NOT MESS UP YOUR AMD CARD! I am really excited for the curved monitor as I have never had one in the past. The monitor also claims to have special features to help your eyes not get strained so that is also a plus.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,2nd Same Model Monitor- 1st Still Working Great After 5+ Years,2018-01-04,"Pros:Great performance for what I use it for.  Speaking about my 5+ year old Acer, no problems, no dead Pixels after using daily for hours on end for over 5 years.  Liked it enough that I bought a this 2nd one along with another HP desk top.  The monitors are literally mounted stacked upon one another.  Because of such they can be accurately compared side by side.   I can say there is little difference of the display between them.  The only difference I can see is the bezel is thinner on the newer version.  Bottom line is the picture has little if any change and would recommend for the kind of computing I do.  I do a lot of internet selling and everything to do with it.  Acer has rarely let me down.  I had one smaller size monitor quit working for no apparent reason some time ago and could not revive it, however it did have some miles on it and this mishap still did not change my opinion of the value and performance I've gotten from these monitors.  I have a total of 4 desk top PCs (and 4 laptops).  I prefer Acer as my monitor of choice even linking into one when I use a laptop at our seasonal cabin.

One last thing, I wish they had a HDMI input/output, since the new (refurb) HP PC has a an HDMI input for the monitor.  I ordered a DVI-D to HDMI adapter for $2.85.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,All Roads for this Acer lead to Awesome!,2017-05-22,"Pros:I've been using Acer monitors for about 6 years or so.  The first two were 22"" LCDs side-by-side, but I upgraded those about a year later when I included them with a computer system I sold a customer.  I bought two 23"" Acers to replace those.  That was about 5 years ago.A few months ago I decided to build my mom a new computer and because so far Acer has been just fine, I stayed with the brand and bought two of these 27"" models.  They were $139.99 each on 2/28/17.  While building her system and in the course of testing it I fell in love with these monitors.So I bought two more on 4/4/17 for myself.  Same price, $139.99 each.  No regrets. Bang for your buck.I noticed today they are $164.99.  I'm good on monitors for now, but if I needed more I'd buy these and wouldn't think twice about the price.  I'd look at other Acers to see if maybe the 32"" models have come down or what the best deal is.  I wouldn't waste time looking at other brands though, as I did a little bit of research already before I bought these, and I've been using Acers for years anyways.Great looking design. Sexy power button that lights up blue.  One DVI and one VGA, cables included.  The power units take up little space.   Side-by-side they line up perfectly.  I have them in a standard landscape orientation, extended display mode, with each monitor's resolution set to the max, which is the recommended 1920 x 1080. Beautiful picture from corner to corner.","Cons:Can't think of any cons because these monitors do everything they're supposed to do.They don't have HDMI, but that's hardly a con because it's not supposed to.","Other Thoughts:Considering what pricing is today for monitors I wouldn't recommend anyone going below 27"".    Now I'm curious about the Acers I just replaced.    I went to my order history to see how long I've had them...   Seems they're actually only 22"" oops.   On 1/8/2009 I bought:2 Acer X223Wbd Black 22"" 5ms Widescreen LCD Monitor Item #: N82E16824009145LCD  $339.98 ($169.99 ea)DANG I didn't think it was that long ago.  Sure hope I get 7 years out of these.  The 22"" Acers I replaced work just fine, I'll probably use them to upgrade a customer's monitor when doing other work for them, just as an added bonus.",1,0

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),2,Disappointing,2017-04-02,"Pros:- Great colors- Good viewing angles- Nice, bright screen (which can be dimmed)- Low cost for a full HD monitor","Cons:- The screen has a subtle but noticeable horizontal line effect that appears whenever there's vertical movement- Faint ""ghost images"" start to appear when bright white shapes have been on screen for a while; the ghost images disappear after about 20 minutes- Monitor is really sensitive to nearby electronic or magnetic things, like desktop speakers- The stand is shorter than I expected (and it isn't height-adjustable)- Comes with only one video cable, which is OK, but it's a VGA cable; I'd prefer DVI instead","Other Thoughts:I'd probably rate the Acer G246HYL monitor 5 out of 5 eggs if it weren't for the annoying horizontal line effect and the ghost images I get. I've spent several days trying different ways to fix those two problems. I've fiddled with the monitor settings, my graphics card settings, switching to different video cables (both DVI and VGA), buying a new surge protector (which the monitor is plugged into), but ultimately nothing fixed the screen problems.The only thing that did help a little (but still didn't fix entirely) was moving my desktop speakers at least couple inches farther away from the monitor. Apparently this monitor is extra sensitive to magnetism, and the speakers contain magnets. It's weird, though, because I've used these same desktop speakers next to another monitor (also from Acer), and that other monitor's screen was never affected by the speakers at all.It's possible I'm unlucky and the monitor I happened to get was defective. On the other hand, this monitor is surprisingly cheap considering its screen resolution and size, so it wouldn't surprise me if Acer cut some corners in the manufacturing quality of this monitor model.",0,0

Other than there's a clear power button protruding on the lower right corner (barely noticeable in the pics) and if they're stacked too close to each other, the lower monitor can knock the monitor above it and turn it off.  I don't think that would have dissuaded me from buying them, but I wish I would have noticed it.","Other Thoughts:Just bought 4 of these for a quad monitor array in my recording studio.

The indicator light turns from blue to amber when you turn the computer off and leave the monitor on.  If the computer is used in a bedroom, the amber light may be too bright for some people who like dark bedrooms for sleep.  I solved the problem by putting tape over the switch/indicator light.","Other Thoughts:The monitor shows the message ""cable not connected"" for one minute when the attached computer is switched off.  My mother who has dementia also uses the monitor and she was confused about this  message.  It would be nice to be able to disable the message as it seems to be totally unnecessary.The buttons for adjusting the monitor's display parameters are on the monitor's lower edge and are unlabeled.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Good Bang for the Buck,2016-09-11,"Pros:-Good size for video editing.  Didn't get a chance to test the SRGB or Adobe RGB coverage but it looked fine with the Windows 7 default wallpaper and scheme and Adobe Premiere.  Not doing major production work so it's fine.-Comes with DVI and VGA Cables.  Using 2 of these monitors with DVI cables since it's connected to a Zotac GTX 950 (ZT-90601-10L).-Easy to install base stand.  1 tool-less screw for leg plate onto neck and 1 tool-less screw for neck onto back of monitor.  Tilt adjustable but no height adjustment.-Thin from front to back, thanks to external AC Adapter.  Same AC Adapter as some Acer laptops.-Vesa Mount compatible.-Thin bezel. Didn't measure gap between two monitors but it's liveable.-Light-weight.  Easy to move around and carry 10 pounds with mount with 1 arm.-Bright.  Didn't notice any bleeding so it's truly back-lit as opposed to edge-lit.-Matte finishing on screen.  Only tested at night but did not notice any glare.",Cons:-Glossy bezel and stand.  Kept the plastic wrapping on as long as possible to avoid dust build up-More VGA cables added to junk pile.,"Other Thoughts:-All ports oriented straight back including power connector.  Not ideal for flat wall-mounting but who does that in 2016 anyways?  Adjustable arms are the way to go.-All buttons oriented straight down on the right with the power button being the right most button.  Personally prefer buttons to be oriented this way as it's less eye-catching.  Power button lights up when on and is completely off when turned off and still plugged in.-No HDMI.  Not a big deal since DVI was always the plan for dual monitors-6ms response time.  Personally have not noticed ghosting or mouse lag during gaming or editing.  Currently using 3 other 6ms Gateway (KX2703) and observed the same things-No speakers.  Who uses monitor speakers in 2016 for video editing?  Get some real audio monitors or decent desktop speakers.-Box comes with handle!

My previous monitor was a 27"" and I wasn't willing to compromise, but silly me, should have spent the extra money for something better. I will say, the monitor does look nice, but that's about it. I may have some messed up refresh rates, but all my attempts to fix that don't seem to stop the constant ""blackouts"" that occur with the screen. I have it connected through the HDMI (did not come with a DVI cable, though I doubt that's the problem), you don't notice the screen tearing when browsing webpages with predominately white space such as here on newegg.com, however when viewing a video horizontal screen tearing can become blatantly obvious and extremely annoying. As for the built-in speakers, I understood they wouldn't be great, but at least pump out a volume that people can actually hear! At the max volume settings, the speakers sound like a pair of headphones left on the table while you're in another room. Not worth the trouble.",3,3

I guess this was my fault for not looking at all the specs.No VESA mount.... again, my fault for not looking at all the specs, but honestly, its been a long time since I have had a monitor without a VESA mount.","Other Thoughts:$89 for a name brand display is a hell of a deal and I am going to call it a win.  I use it on the family computer and it has a DVI out so this display worked for me. Keep in mind.... not all video cards these days have a DVI out... so be forewarned.The DVI cable that comes with the display is laughable. It is only about 3 to 4 feet long.  So I had to dust off my 8 footer from about 8 years ago.There are better options for the $130 they are asking right now for this display, but for the $89 I paid I would say its worth it.",1,4

I've had one for about 2 years now, and just bought a second.  The setup on it is pretty easy, though the stand does feel like you're going to break it when connecting them.

Also the LED background lighting became clearly visible through the screen in the first few weeks. Acer was at least willing to replace the monitor for that but shipping was up to me to provide. After calling to complain about the contrast being bad and them walking me through all the possible adjustment settings, I was told that ""That is just how the monitor is made now"". There would be no replacement for that problem.","Other Thoughts:I bought this to be a companion to the same model monitor I was using previously but the older ""version a"" was no longer available.

Over the years I have owned many of them, and they have been reliable, and offer great performance.  I owned an Acer monitor as well, a 17"" LCD and it worked well, had nice colors.  I needed a nice widescreen for the PC that I use in my home recording studio.  When I saw this Acer come up for under a $100 price tag, I thought perfect, Wide Screen and it's Acer.  What a mistake.  It took me 20 minutes just to figure out how to work the screen adjustment buttons.  They are tiny, under the edge of border trim, real easy to screw up, I ended up laying the monitor flat to work the adjustments.  The Contrast and Brightness are a killer, just makes everything washed out.  There's no richness or depth.  I just ordered a Dell S2240M. My wife uses that Monitor, it's gorgeous.

Contrast adjustment is almost non effective and there are no dark blacks even when the picture is blank.  The colors are good but somewhat washed out depending on viewing angle.,"Other Thoughts:Got this monitor for $99.  For a 23 inch monitor in that price range I can live with the less than perfect picture.  Earlier in the year however, for just $20 more, I got a 24"" Acer G24 Series monitor that blows these away.",1,0

Adjustment seem to do little to help.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this because I liked the price and though Acer was a good brand. Now that I see the quality of the picture I regret my purchase. This monitor is only good for someone who wants the cheapest available and wants to use it for functionality only, for example, spreadsheets at work. If you want to use it for movies, video games, photos, and entertainment, then buy something else. Newegg did a good job shipping and processing this order.",1,0

The dead/stuck pixels are near the center of the screen (really annoying!).  Customer service said 30 days for returns/exchange.  GARBAGE.  There is a reasonable expectation in the life of a product to operate without flaws and just over a month is not it.,Other Thoughts:I would be very happy with the product if not for the dead/stuck grouping of pixels which ruin the experience of using this monitor.,7,0

Returned the 55"" TV to the store because these monitors are immense and massive enough to watch DVDs from across the street.  Neighbors are suspicious.","Cons:Had to rearrange the entire desk to accommodate the bigness of these monitors.  Bolted the desktop hutch to the wall to make room, now we can't reach the desk lamp.

I bought a smaller Acer monitor about 4 years ago, it is still working fine and going strong.",Cons:The power cord and stand are cheap-looking and low-quality.  Did not care for the nonstandard power cord with the transformer (a small one) but oh well.  Included VGA and DVI cables are cheap as well--but at least included.  I'm nervous that the power cord may wear out over time it stretched or pulled just the slightest bit?,"Other Thoughts:We'll see how these do over time,",2,0

The screen is very well lit and has bright brights and dark darks.It's wall mountable and comes included with VGA and DVI- cables, and the three I bought look great side by side.","Cons:The only con I can think of is the lack of an hdmi port, but I don't use hdmi anyway so this isn't a con for me.","Other Thoughts:This is a great looking monitor for the price, and I'd highly recommend it for anybody looking for a good monitor for the price.",2,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Excellent for the price,2015-08-08,"Pros:Got this on sale -- very happy with the monitor, especially at the sale price.  Image is very good IMO.  I had been using an old Viewsonic 19"" 4:3 monitor which worked fine but definitely needed to be retired.  I don't think this monitor was any more expensive that what I paid years ago for the V'sonic.  Moving from my old monitor to this one was practically a religious experience  :-)","Cons:As others have noted, it's kind of a bummer that the control buttons are on the bottom of the monitor instead of on the bezel.  But how often do you adjust the picture controls?  In my case, probably just once when I first setup the monitor, so that's just not such a big deal as some people have made it out to be.  Certainly not worth dropping an egg for.  Also, people have complained about the monitor coming with the brightness set at 100%.  Well, duh.  Every monitor is set to that coming out of the factory so that if it's set up in a store, it's got a bright enough image to stand out, since all of your big-box stores are incredibly brightly lit.  So just turn down the brightness!  I turned mine down to 40 and it was fine.  The contrast, which is set at 50, probably needs some adjusting too.  These aren't really cons -- every monitor needs some picture tweaking out of the box.Another point:  the base is kind of hard to assemble.  But again, you only have to do that once and it's over.  Not worthy of a dropped egg.","Other Thoughts:If you want a simple, inexpensive and straightforward 24"" monitor with a really nice picture, this is for you.

WOW!! :) I got this monitor to replace the 21"" CRT I had been using for years. It was (and actually still is) fine, but it was HUGE and used a lot of power, generating a fair bit of heat. This monitor uses a laptop style ""power brick"", and generates almost no noticeable heat! The difference in sharpness & clarity is stunning! I can't believe I was happy with that old CRT for so long, now! WOW! ;)Facebook, pictures, etc, never looked so good! I even had to adjust the colors of my desktop in Windows, because they were TOO VIVID on this monitor! (That's how washed-out my old CRT actually was!)

The side to side viewing angle is better than the up/down viewing angle.It only has VGA and DVI inputs. You would thing that a product produced in this day and age would at least have HDMI and this thing doesn't.  I knew it only had VGA and DVI inputs before I bought it because I'm happy with DVI but other people out there may be wanting HDMI or Display Port and so you know this don't got 'em.",Other Thoughts:Overall I think this is a nice monitor.  I bought 2 of them a couple weeks before Father's Day and Newegg happened to have a discount on them that day for buying 2 or more and then they had an additional 10% off promo code so for what I ended up paying for them it's easy for me to overlook their lack of HDMI or display port and the fairly poor vertical viewing angle.  At regular price I don't know if they're quite wort it but when they're on sale like they were when I bought them I think they're a good buy.,0,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,One of the best 1080p monitors out there,2015-06-11,"Pros:Extremely nice image quality, best of any ""cheap"" monitor I have owned (sub $500 category). Thin frame, thin bezels, semi-matte coating that stops too much glare but doesnt leave bad image quality like some coatings.",Cons:wish it also had a display port input.,"Other Thoughts:VA panel types are the best IMO. TN types suffer color shift in off-axis, IPS suffers from glow, and VA suffers from contrast shift. Easily the least noticeable of the bunch.TN colorshifting can make images look funny and is a lot more noticeable on 27"" size displays. That is why people make a fuss about it now days, we used to be on 19-23"" monitors so there was very little of-axis viewing angles to the corners of the monitor. Now on 27"" sizes we have that issue.IPS glow is also pretty bad and noticeable on 27"" sizes because of the same off-axis angles to the corners and this glow ruins black levels and dark images or scenes.VA contrast shift can somewhat ruin dark scenes but not nearly as bad as IPS glow does.",4,0

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),2,"Big, but didn't work properly",2015-05-28,Pros:The screen itself is big and bright with good colors and decent resolution. Attractive design.,Cons:The screen stopped working properly a week after I bought it. The power button and the other buttons used to adjust the monitors settings ceased to function after a few days (If they ever worked to begin with) Called Acer tech support and they ran me through the turn it off & on again routine but it looks like it's a faulty piece of equipment.

I've been adjusting it on the fly for late night (i.e. DARK) sessions. Buttons are easy to use, and out of the sight of rugrats.For the price and specs, I knew I was not getting ""top of the line"", but I feel I've stumbled into ""hugely awesome goodness""!The ""blur"" on high speed turns / moves is noticeable, but not annoying.

It won't power on.  Acer told me I have to mail it back (on my dime), and they won't provide me with a box to ship it in.  Where am I going to find a secure shipping box for a 24"" flat screen monitor?!",4,4

Edge to edge display with no distortion.Factory 3 yr limited warranty.  Included CD has both Quick and Full Manual plus link to registration/ website.","Cons:OSD is under bottom of screen.  Need a mirror to see which button is for what function.  Confusing to work it by braille.  Manual little help. Fortunately I have Intel Graphics and Media Control Panel.Powered by brick to 5vDC plug.  Brick requires proprietary 120vAC cord.Display cable ports are all straight out, not down.

This G6 series 24 inch model not shown on Acer website, so don't discard the CD.Note s/n on back before hookup or find it on shipping box.  Also displays when OSD info option selected.

I was unsure at first due to the relatively low price but the positive reviews from other users gave me reason to give it a try.  I'm glad I did, as these are excellent monitors for the price.",2,0

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,G276HL Monitor,2015-04-29,"Pros:I purchased this monitor about 19 months ago when it was on sale. I bought it at this sale price of $200 from newegg. So far it has been a great monitor. No problems at all. no pixilation, no annoying lines etc... and it is powered up at least 6 hrs. per day, and on all weekend with lots of use. It is worth the $200.00 I paid for it.","Cons:I do wish it had alittle more movement to adjust the screen, and the bezel was thinner for multiple monitors that I plan on adding to this setup. But both cons not less than 5 eggs ranking.",Other Thoughts:I do perfer the adjustment controls hidden out of sight as with this monitor.,2,1

Great color LED display.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:I wanted more than 60Hz but this was on sale and was a great deal for the price at the time($130). Monitors seem to have not changed in price since I bought it so it's an interesting market to look at.,1,0

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),1,Using it literal makes me sick,2015-04-24,"Pros:My Hanns-Gs, of 7 years, finally had the capacitors go out on them.  So I needed something quick and cheap to get me through and got these.  Ordered on Friday and got on Tuesday..  Set was easy and they look nice.  That's where it ends.","Cons:After about 15 minutes of using them I started getting really bad headaches and becoming nauseated.  I am sure it's because of the ""washed out"" color others have mentioned.I have tried adjusting all kinds of settings both the monitors and using 3rd party software.  I have tried positioning of these screens.  I have tried using both my clear and amber gunners.  Nothing I do aside from not using them helps.I can't be on my computer longer than 10 minutes with these monitors without getting a horrible headache and becoming nauseated, and I can't have that as I do a lot of work on my computer.  I have never had this issue prior with any other monitor.I have dead pixels on one that it arrived with, but only seems to be one.","Other Thoughts:I got these for about $10 cheaper than my Hanns-Gs that I bought these to replace.  Those had mounting, speakers, and wasn't washed out, and lasted me since 2008.  I was expecting a bit more from a monitor than something that made me feel like throwing up after 10 -15 minutes of use.",1,11
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Great Monitor,2015-04-23,"Pros:27"" was the perfect size for me. No problems with the screen, been running fine for a week now.Can't beat it for the price.","Cons:The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5, is the startup splash screen.  When you turn on the display you get the Acer logo and then the Energy star logo immediately after.  It's only a few seconds, but it is enough to annoy me.  I don't mind the Acer logo, but adding the second one takes too much time.  Looked online for a solution, doesn't appear to have one.","Other Thoughts:I don't use the built-in speaker, I have a sound system.  I did plug it in when I first got it.  The speaker sounded ""OK"".  I think the volume control would be a pain to use.",4,2
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Great choice.,2015-04-21,"Pros:Great value, best choice in my opinion for this screen size & resolution.  If you want to jump up in resolution, the price jumps with it.  I've found this to be a happy medium.  I have owned 1 for a few years, and just received 2 more.  The 2 new ones work well, and the old one is still ticking.  Clear image, good color quality, plenty of settings available, no dead pixels.","Cons:I ordered 2 new ones, and previously owned 1 for a few years.  I have the exact same model number from a few years ago, but the trim around the monitor is slightly thicker than the brand new ones I just got.  I was hoping all 3 monitors would line up perfectly, but since the one that is a few years old has a thicker border, the monitors are slightly off-level when lined up.  First world problems :(","Other Thoughts:For the people complaning about color quality and resolution, go ahead and look at the costs of jumping to the next highest resolution / better color quality.  You'll see this monitor can't be beat for $199.  If it costs more than $199, wait for it to go on sale again, it's almost always on sale for $199.",2,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Good purchase,2015-04-17,"Pros:I  bought this monitor more  than a year & half ago. Scrren quality is just as good as the first day I set it up. Got it when it was on sale, and I made a good buy.","Cons:Maybe have a little more wigggle room to move screen around, but certainely not a game changer.I use headphones, so I  cannot judge the built in speakers.",,2,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,"Good, if troubled",2015-04-17,"Pros:I like the picture quality. It's not overly impressive by any means and the size is excellent at 27 inches.  Since the stand screws into the monitor itself, it's not going to jostle lose any time soon unless you're given bad screws. A small thing: I like that the power light actually turns off and does not shift to a neutral red or something.",Cons:Dead pixel out of the box. Very annoyed at that and having RMA thoughts. Stand is very stiff as well and I have trouble moving it at times.,,1,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,"Really 24"" diagonal screen",2015-04-14,"Pros:Price, 3-yr warranty, includes an analog as well as an HDMI cord, slimmer bezel than most 24"" monitors, easy set-up.... the screen really is 24"" diagonal unlike many 24"" monitors which are a half inch shorter (diagonally).","Cons:After running the CD for registration, the drop down menu doesn't have Windows 8 as an option, so this must be an old model. The driver is dated 2009 which is 5 years old! It really doesn't need a driver because Windows recognizes it without any problems, so I didn't load the driver.","Other Thoughts:There are plenty of choices for excellent 24"" monitors and this is as good as any of them. It has a larger viewing screen than most 24"" class monitors. Between  newer HANNS-G and Philips 24"" monitors that I own, this looks better to me using Nvidia 760 video card and Nvidia driver.",1,1
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,"a full featured 27"" for a nice price",2015-04-11,"Pros:No dead pixels, no problems with it since purchasing a few months ago, has a good selection of inputs.

The stand isn't nearly as adjustable as I'd like it to be.,"Other Thoughts:The panel is better (wide viewing angle) than some non-IPS panels (like TN), but the colors suffer compared to IPS.

Packaging was very good, easy to remove, would be easy to repack as it was new for any RMA.  The stand is solid and went together intuitively.  Very light for such a large screen.Easy to see even with ambient light.  Power button is easy to locate because it glows.  No blind stroking of your monitor to get that invisible touch button!Comes with DVI and VGA cables which is a plus, both are decent length and feel solid.Power adapter uses an inline converter, no wall wart means easy to plug in on a power strip.","Cons:No HDMI, but I knew it in advance, so I'm not taking any eggs off.Requires an inline power converter and doesn't take a standard PC 3-prong into the monitor, though the converter is reasonable in size and doesn't heat up.  Can't give 5 eggs to any monitor that has specialty accessories, even if I knew it in advance.",,1,2
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),1,Damaged on Arrival,2015-02-28,Pros:None,"Cons:The monitor came with a large crack in the upper left corner of the screen.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Great gaming option,2015-02-23,"Pros:Pros:Large screenSmall Bezel6ms Response TimeVery slimVery good viewing anglesGreat priceI purchased 3 of these to be configured as a surround for my main gaming rig. They were being driven by a Nvidia GTX 980 @ a display resolution of 5760x1080.The color saturation is excellent and the brightness/contrast ranges are very versatile allowing for adjustment for any viewing preference. Zero dead pixels on all three monitors.Because I am using these (3) monitors in a surround configuration it was important that the bezels be as small as reasonably possible. These bezel widths are only 3/8"" (10mm) which allows for minimal vertical bars on a surround configuration. Excellent for driving or flying simulations. The panel is very thin helped in part by the external power pack. Typically the first thing to fail on a LCD display is the power supply inside the unit. Because this one is external the unit thickness is substantially reduced and the owner has the ability to swap out the power supply as it is external.",Cons:Cons:Flimsy Stand (No swivel and too low)No HDMI portIt is hard to come up with much to complain about on this unit as it is truly a great price point and you can't get everything. The horizontal viewing angle seems to be more shallow than the 178° advertised.,Other Thoughts:I have purchased three of these in October 2014 and i am reviewing them now in February 2015 so that my review is based on 4 months of use. I am very happy with these displays for a high end gaming rig. They perform as expected and sip energy which helps keep the gaming environment cool. The only reason I did not give these displays 5 eggs was the lack of an HDMI connection and week stand. Very reliable and awesome picture.,8,1
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),1,Decent Monitor,2015-02-10,"Pros:Got a set of monitors for everyday use and casual gaming such as Battlefield 4, World of Warcraft, etc. It was working great until yesterday. See Cons.","Cons:I have had 2 of these monitors for only 6 months at this point. One of the monitors I purchased started producing a VERY high-pitched noise regardless of whether it is on or off.Not sure what the noise is but it it sounds like a pressure cooker about to blow. I'm actually very distracted by the noise and feel that it might catch on fire while I am not at home.I don't have confidence that this monitor will last too long. Threw away the box that it came in, so I don't know what my course of action can be at this point to get it replaced under the manufacturer's 1 year warranty.What I am planning to do is to unplug it from the computer so at least I am not risking losing any other parts if the monitor does blow out.","Other Thoughts:One of the monitors arrived completely shattered.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Great Monitor For The Price,2014-12-28,"Pros:Great price with computer comboSetupWith f.lux installed it makes for a warmer look to the screen, which others have complained about.",Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:Don't think you will find a better monitor with the specs when this is on sale or with a combo like I got.,0,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),3,No so good for this resolution,2014-12-24,"Pros:For this size, resolution should be higher than 1920. I see big pixels. And you can easily see any dead pixels. It does not display white color properly, it is kind of yellowish. I tried adjustment in the color management of my adapter with no success. Not for me. But price is low and I paid for what I got..... I don't mind to pay a little more to get better color.",Cons:I have two DVI to VGA cables but I can't use them . My cable has 4 more pins around the bigger connector pin. I don't know why..... So I can't test DVI to VGA connection to my laptop. Not good....,,1,16
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Awesome for the Price!,2014-12-15,"Pros:I've had this monitor for about 9 months now and it's still working flawlessly.  I got it on sale for $179.99, you just can't beat that.I have it mounted on a swivel up above my two 24"" monitors and it looks great.  I have not had any problems whatsoever.The picture quality is also great, bright with nice colors.","Cons:I won't knock any eggs off for these but:- no HDMI (but for this price I honestly don't care at all)- As others have said, it is a bit flimsy.

Honestly can't say much more than it works and lives up to it's description.,Cons:Better packaging for transit should have been taken.,"Other Thoughts:Assembly was easy, but rather strange. It takes 2 screws to assemble the monitor to the stand. One is a Phillips head   and other is a flat head. Why not just make them the same thing?When we got the monitor the box had a hole. Before UPS left we opened it up and the monitor was fine. However, it's the basic packaging. I would have liked to see  better packaging  so the screen is a lot more protected than a screen cover, Styrofoam and cardboard.",3,0

They also have a very small profile, and the VESA mount is easily accessible.  This monitor would make for an excellent display to be mounted on an arm.","Cons:The only disappointing factors I've noticed are that there are only 2, somewhat dated inputs.  D-Sub (VGA) and DVI.  The power cord feeds into a converter box, and also isn't your standard PC power cable.","Other Thoughts:I ordered 2, one arrived damaged.",3,2
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Acer FG6 Monitor,2014-12-02,Pros:Nice size and beautiful matte screen display. Color vivid and clear.,Cons:I use this monitor directly facing it at eye level and without a rather hokey homemade pedestal to set the monitor on I wasn't able to adjust it sufficiently downward to get the correct viewing angle. Only one egg off for that minor inconvenience. Also as in all of these type monitors the screen adjustment controls aren't the easiest to access and use.,Other Thoughts:I don't know why manufactures don't supply a secure and adjustable stand for adjustment of the proper viewing angle- especially on a monitor with  this visual quality.,2,0

I'm pleased with the purchase.,"Other Thoughts:Front bezel is glossy but not an issue since its so thin.Resolution is 1920 x 1080, same as my two 23"" LCDs.

So it works great with my systems.When positioned next to another monitor from a very large PC maker, the image on this monitor is much better.","Cons:No real cons, only ones I know about before I purchased the screen. The monitor stand is a little flimsy and the monitor will rock a little if you knock it - but I don't so it's not a problem at all for me - so I won't deduct any eggs.Unfortunately the price has risen in the last week but when/if it drops to the price point where I bought it, I'll buy another one or two.",,1,1

Its still running strong and does the job.","Cons:For some this may not be a con, but this thing is crazy bright. I have an ASUS VE247H 23.6"" and I appreciate its blacks much more than this one. No matter how I tune this one it shines like the surface of the sun.

Easy to set up, every port (VGA,HDMI,DVI) is there to use, works great, and the picture quality/refresh rate is great, to boot.Very noticeable difference upgrading from a 5year old LG 23"" monitor. Colors really popped out, and generally looked brighter.5 Eggs!","Cons:Absolutely none. Shipping was instantaneous, Price was great, Came with 2 extra cables (no HDMI, but comeon, you can get it from here for 3$.

Fast shipping, very fair price.Setup was easy, only needed a flathead screwdriver, and both worked great right out of the box.  I keep looking for dead pixels, but so far I've just found several bits of dust that have drifted onto the monitors since I set them up.  Disappointing in a good way.  As advertised the tilt is adjustable.  Stands are nothing to write home about, but they are doing the job just fine on a standard desk and I have no reason to replace them.  I'm not particularly picky with brightness/contrast/color, and I haven't had the need to sit at the desk for more than a few hours yet, so I haven't made any settings changes since setting them up.  No complaints with the defaults though, everything looks awesome.","Cons:No HDMI input, needed a HDMI F / DVI M adapter to hook up to my laptop's second output in my temporary setup.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),3,Decent for the discounted price AND VESA MOUNT!,2014-08-29,"Pros:I wanted accessory displays for web browsing, youtubing, HW monitoring, etc etc. Never intended for my main display, but I needed one with VESA mounts as I already have an arm setup.An affordable monitor WITH VESA mounts is very rare. I was skeptical of going with TN next to my LG 34UM95 (a high end IPS), but I had a hard time justifying spending more for accessory monitors.","Cons:This is still TN, but the biggest problems are the brightness and contrast out of the box. THEY ARE TERRIBLE.Anyone who thinks the brightness and colors are good clearly haven't used higher quality displays. It's not that it's TN, it's as if Acer tried to make it look like an IPS on store shelves by cranking up contrast and brightness to stupidly high levels.Turn Contrast to zero (yes ZERO). Turn Brightness down to ~60. One needed 60 and the other needed 63. Checked with my i1 DisplayPro but you can tell the difference immediately.","Other Thoughts:AFTER CHANGING THE ABOVEIt's an ok value monitor. VESA mount is a huge plus, as I think there are a few better options if that's not important (but remember those other options probably have terrible non-adjustable stands nor VESA mounts).Side viewing angles are decent for the price. Vertical is worse, but given the price......eh, I can live with it. As far as accessory displays go, I'm satisfied (not very happy, just satisfied) with these for the $150 price each.

Just got my 3rd monitor last week and will be building a new desk since my current one is not large enough to fit 3 of them.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Great monitor for a low price,2014-08-27,"Pros:If you are looking for a decent monitor for a great price look no further.  I got a couple of these on sale through New Egg and I think I got a great deal.The monitors are extremely light and very idea if you are thinking of using them in a 3 monitor set-up like is on my Wife's computer.  They are easy to install in a mount with the standard VERSA mounting on the back.They are a good size monitor at 24"" and display a good picture.  It has a decent response time and we use them for gaming.","Cons:The only con I can think of is that the monitor does NOT have an HDMI output, DVI only!

This is the perfect LED monitor.,"Other Thoughts:If you see these on sale, just buy as many as you need. I thought I might regret spending so much on new monitors, or have to deal with dead or stuck pixels, but I have never been more pleased with a monitor purchase in my 20 years of PC ownership.",0,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Not bad for the $$$ (if on sale),2014-08-15,"Pros:Got it on sale. Good buy for the price. The size is great, and so is the slim bezel. It's also extremely bright, as other reviewers have mentioned. The stand is a bit flimsy, and mine seems to wanna lean to the left a little, especially when you attempt to adjust the settings, which causes it to lean to the left due to the flimsy stand(the neck portion of the stand is separate from the X shaped foot, and I believe the neck portion has too much play where it connects to the LCD itself). But, I purchased a desktop VESA mount for it, so the flimsy stand won't be an issue for me, but might be for you.Overall for the money, if you catch this one on sale it seems like a good buy. The colors do appear slightly washed out, as other reviews have mentioned. But I'm a firm believer in ""you get what you pay for"". So considering the price and size, not to mention, the higher price of other LCDs this size category, I can't really complain about the colors looking ""washed out"", can I? lolAlso, I can't say I noticed the buzzing sound from the AC brick when lowering the brightness, that other reviewers have complained about. And I have this LCD in an acoustically treated recording studio, so if the buzz was there, I WOULD hear it. I have my brightness at 68. No buzz here. And mine didn't have any bad pixels, so YEAH!","Cons:My issues with this LCD are as such.My particular LCD has a jammed adjustment button. The 5th button just before the power button doesn't ""click"" like the other 4 buttons. You literally have to hold the monitor still and press HARD on the 5th button which is the ^ button(up arrow). The other 4 buttons work fine. The click and are easy to press and use. That 5th button thought.. NIGHTMARE MODE [ON]. Makes it a REAL pain to adjust the settings. I basically have to use the down arrow (4th button) and continually cycle thru the settings. Although on some of the menus you CANT do that.Other than that, and the lack of good color saturation/washed out look... I dunno.. The ""e"" acer color setting defaults; Non of them are really visually appealing to me. I had to create a customized settings to get this thing looking close to acceptable(which drove me INSANE with that 5th button being jammed). I can't see how anyone that does professional graphic design could use this for graphic work, and feel confident that they are seeing a trust worthy representation of the color scale. The contrast is good. The saturation is NOT.Other than those things, its not a bad all around every day LCD for the cash. I paid 179 on sale. If you are not overly critical about color saturation, catch it on sale, and you get a good specimen, then I would say, go for it.","Other Thoughts:Because of the defective button on my first monitor, I figured I would just buy another, then send this one back. But the price went up 40 bucks since I purchase mine a week ago. So I called Newegg to see if they would price match me purchasing a replacement.Instead of that, they are cross shipping me a replacement LCD, paying for return shipping on the defective LCD, and not charging me a penny!THIS IS WHY I BUY ALL MY COMPUTER PARTS AT NEWEGG!",4,0

Light weight and narrow bezel means easy multiple screen mounts.","Cons:Speakers are so small in size that they are virtually useless.  I suspect Acer just shoved in what they could to the frame and the result is awful.  What is the point of an HDMI interface when the audio output is essentially totally useless and these is no digital audio pass through?  There is analog audio input also.Very limited color adjustments, no RGB user adjustments, only some pre-packed modes like movie, game, normal, warm, cool profiles.

I had to return that one because of a weird sound it was making, and I bought this Acer monitor instead.I thought I would notice a huge difference between the IPS screen technology and the TN panel in this Acer, but I don't. As far as I'm concerned, this Acer holds it's own against the IPS display I bought. The only noticeable difference is that the viewing angle is not as good. However, it's not that bad either. Some reviews on here got me concerned by saying it's terrible, but I have no qualms with it at all. It's a beautiful picture.I don't think the lesson here is that TN is actually as good as IPS... not at all. I'm just saying I had bought a $130ish IPS screen, and this $130ish TN panel is comparable to it for sure. Don't get too hung up on the matter in this price range.

You can also adjust the brightness, contrast ratio, & a few other options.  I'm starting to like this monitor more & more.  Oh, and there's no backlight bleed around the edges like with my 24"" Viewsonic monitor my son just broke!

It's very lightweight so it feels a little cheap to me (and it actually was... 179 bucks on sale).  Also, it's not much bigger than the 24"" Viewsonic I just had to replace.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Fantastic!,2014-07-29,"Pros:I bought this monitor while on sale last week. I'm a developer and was buying it for work, so didn't want to spend a fortune. Well, I'm blown away and sorely tempted to take this one home and bring in the Samsung I got the other year for way more than this costs! The screen is bright (I turned it down to 50% brightness), there's no sign of any issues and even on VGA it looked great. I also picked up a HDMI->DVI Cable, but even without that the screen was better than my former monitor.As it's for work, and I'm primarily looking at development environments I wasn't looking for something great for gaming. I do play videos, although they tend to be development. They play great on this screen.","Cons:As another reviewer has mentioned, the further you turn the brightness down the more audible the buzz becomes. I believe it's coming from the power pack. for me, that's right behind the monitor, but there are other sounds in the office so I don't notice it. It's bearable unless you have great hearing and everything is really quiet.I'll list no hdmi as a con, although it's not really a big one considering you can pick up a HDMI->DVI cable for about $6. Considering the savings you're making, it works out.If you have a less than stable desk, this monitor is going to move when you type. I have a Samsung monitor at home, it has a plastic stand similar to this. When I start typing, the monitor starts shaking. Really annoying. I have two dell monitors that don't suffer that problem on the same desk. It's a minor minor con, and not worth dinking the monitor for.","Other Thoughts:So, my cons seemed to go on longer than my pros, but there are far more pros to this monitor.

I do enjoy the settings and found a preset that makes the image better however it took alot of fiddling with it.the stands are small and sturdy enough so i can fit keyboard and mouse wires around them and fit webcams and microphones aswell as chords for programming things like arduino.,Cons:bit of high contrast that i get at the right viewing angle however i fixed it with software for the display. the stands are a bit low for my liking and i cant really get a better mount due to the unique one they have (havent done alot of research though). No HDMI port so watch out for that. very little tiltability so if you sit up very high or low compared to your desk you might have trouble. I saw reviews bout light leaking through but i didnt get that yet.,Other Thoughts:great for the price wish i bought three however they take up a medium amount of desk space so make sure to have enough desk space if you get more than 1(seeing as you cant mount them using a standard mount for say Dell monitors unless acer has their equivalent) . very solid but i see some bad reviews so check out those people's stories and balance the good and bad before you buy,1,0

I plan on buying another for eyefinity. The only complaint is that the monitor is a little dimmer then the standard unit. However, I think the color representation on it is slightly better. The bottoms directly match up, but the standard is about 1/4"" higher. The screens though (which is most important) are directly even with one another.The lower brightness could be part of using displayport w/ active adapter compared to HDMI on the other monitor. Haven't tested the various ports to see if it changes.",1,0

Its intended purpose is for movie watching, and lots of it! I wish it had an HDMI port, but adapters are cheap. It is also easy to use, plug it in and it looks good.",Cons:This is not a good monitor for pictures or anything requiring high resolution. The pixels are too spread to to make a really sharp image.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),3,Eh,2014-06-13,"Pros:Definitely has great colors. Whites and bright and blacks are dark with a lot of space inbetween for subtle shades; ie. the contrast ratio is very apparent which makes for a great monitor to watch movies and play games on. Everything is very sharp and clear and it's really great to look at.Didn't have to fiddle with any settings when I installed it; it was practically perfect out of the box and the auto-adjust is incredibly competent (this is rare for me personally, but it may be standard?)","Cons:The viewing angle is terrible. The high contrast ratio just isn't relevant anymore when you have to sink into your chair so low that your chin is level with with the BOTTOM of the monitor for distinct shades to be clearly visible (monitors are generally designed to be viewed so that the top border of the monitor should be level with your forehead, or so I've read, and so my experience has confirmed). Very disappointing for my default desk setup. It's an inconvenience, but fairly easy to remedy because you can also prop it up on something.I also found that it looks significantly better when viewed straight-on from a medium distance rather than the distance one would view it at while sitting at a desk. This seems incredibly odd for a desktop computer monitor.","Other Thoughts:I did not regret my purchase. It's a solid monitor and I'm relatively satisfied, but I would not buy it again, nor would I be quick to recommend it.",0,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),2,"Wow, the image quality is BAD",2014-06-13,"Pros:It does display things.It's very thin, and fairly attractive.","Cons:Let me start out by saying that I'm not going to compare this monitor to far more expensive and fancier monitors, and give it a bad review for that reason.Rather, I'm comparing this monitor to the numerous Acer G226HQLs that we have in our office.  The G226 is a smaller version of the same monitor.  They're in the same category as far as quality goes, and fall into the same price range.We recently got a few of these G236es, and on all of them there is an absurdly bright bleed-through on the bottom of the screen.  With some brightness adjustment, the top of the monitor can be made to appear black while the bottom matches the #6a6d7d which I'm displaying on the good quality IPS panel on my laptop.  For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, #6a6d7d is a surprisingly light shade of grey, as represented in hexadecimal color notation, as used in web development.That's a VERY light shade of grey.Also, no matter what combination of brightness/contrast I've tried (and between all the factory presets), images displayed on the screen are washed out and ""overexposed"" even at best.Compare that to the cheaper and comparable G236HL sitting on the other side of my laptop and it's night and day.  The smaller, cheaper Acer has a nearly imperceptible backlight gradient when displaying black, and images are quite crisp and show great contrast for a monitor of its class.The vertical viewing angle on the G236 is also reprehensible.  When viewed head-on, with my eye level at the middle/center of the screen about 24 inches away, the top of the screen shows noticeable luma inversion.  When viewed head-on with my eye level about 4 inches above the top of the monitor (standard sitting-at-desk posture), the bottom becomes even MORE ""overexposed"" and washed out, while the top of the screen looks normal.If I hunch over just right (or tilt the monitor back just right), there's a 2 degree [estimated] sweet spot.  So if I never move my head, it looks somewhat OK.  Except for the backlight bleed, of course.Movies look horrible.  Bright sitcom-y video looks passable, I guess.  Pictures all look overexposed, particularly the farther down on the image you look.I know it's possible that we just got a few bad units from the same lot, and that there are good versions of this monitor floating around.  But as far as I'm concerned, consider the G226HQL.  It's veritably the same display, just a couple of inches smaller, and it actually does look great for its price.",,1,5

The lower the brightness the louder the hum. I usually like my brightness around 70-80 so it kinda sucks to have a constant hum.

Now the Con: the adjustment switches are hidden and next to the power switch under the frame you can not see them or really feel them unless you turn the monitor on its side, plus the adjustment are not real user friendly - but on the bright side just how many times do you make adjustments, with my last monitor I adjusted it when I got it once and that was 4 years ago so not a big issue but I hope they change this design in the future.",Other Thoughts:BIG and BRIGHT and works right out of the box - what more can you ask for - another great deal from Newegg!,1,0

Took 5 minutes. Newegg shipping was awesome and the box came in great condition. It handles the games I thow at it just fine and im more than content with it.

I have two other monitors I can compare this monitor with:  ASUS VS248H-P, and a 24"" AOC monitor (I don't know the model number, but it's about a year old).Accessories:Came with a power cable (small 'brick' type), DVI cable, VGA cable, Drivers CD and stand.Stand:This monitor has the nicest stand of the three (I would rank them: AOC, Asus, Acer). You have a small degree of adjustability and the stand holds the monitor pretty steady, even amidst light jostling of the desk it's sitting on. However, it's still a cheap-feeling plastic stand and the adjustment was pretty hard to do at first (a lot friction in the mechanism--I had to double check the specs listed here to make sure it was adjustable and that I wasn't going to break it.)The stand comes in two pieces and is very easy to assemble and disassemble (two screws--one philips, one flat head).Monitor/Panel:The monitor itself is a matte panel with a decent (not good or great) picture. The colors are pretty washed out (image quality is on par with the AOC monitor, and a little worse than the Asus.) The adjustments in the menu don't seem to do much for it. I also found a dead pixel in the upper right quarter of the monitor. So, overall, not a terribly impressive panel--but if you just need a productivity monitor (and don't care about perfect colors or the odd missing pixel) this fits the bill pretty well.Overall:Don't expect to be blown away by this monitor. It's cheap, it's practical but that's about it. It's by no means a 'hidden gem' or a 'steal of a value' for the price (as all the five star reviews might lead you to think.)

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Very Happy,2014-04-04,"Pros:This is a terrific monitor! I have been looking for another monitor for a dual setup. I have been looking for months when I found this one. Actually, have had it in my wish list for some time, but when it came on sale, I had to give it a go. Very lightweight, and does not take up much space due to the slim design. I have a 24"" Ultra Sharp monitor as my main, and really cannot see s difference in picture. Not sure this would make a good gaming monitor, but as a stand alone monitor, or a second for a duel, you will be very pleased. Set up is fast, and settings are pretty simple. For a 27"" monitor at the sale price, it was a slam dunk that came out awesome. Would have got another, but the sale ended. If this lasts 3 or 4 years, it will be even better of a value.","Cons:If I could think of any, it would be very picky. But for this size and under $200, what the heck more could you ask for?","Other Thoughts:If you are a gamer, I cannot make testament for this.

One day it simply disappeared, but doesn't mean it's gone.Monitor also has a tendency not to come out of standby or fail to turn on when I turn my PC on.

Things sure have changed though.  This isn't the Acer of the 90's, and with each and every passing year lately their products just seem to be getting better and better.  I used to avoid Acer at all costs, but now they're a top brand for me.With regards to this monitor, wow!  Great quality, solid build, and beautiful picture.  It's not loaded with bells and whistles.  It is a straight forward wide-screen monitor that simply gets the job done.  I was using a 20"" Dell that was almost 10 years old so this was a HUGE upgrade.","Cons:I wouldn't call it a con, but the monitor wasn't quite as big as I was expecting.  I think it being a wide screen monitor had something to do with that.  If you're used to a traditional square monitor please be advised this is very WIDE.  Because of this, you don't get an extraordinary amount of height (In fact, it's the same height as my 20"" Dell) - Instead you get a very wide monitor. (duh) - So not really a con but just be advised of that.  If I could go back I would aim for something like 28"", but oh well!",,2,0

It's got a fantastic image.  Great specs and as a 2nd monitor has become my most favorite monitor.  It definitely improves and enhances my productivity while I'm working.  The package arrived in 3 days, perfect shipping from Newegg and no lost pixels.  A perfect monitor.  It came with the DVI cable, which I connected my DVI female to HDMI male and plug in directly into my laptop.  It's super convenient to place 2 documents side by side or 2 Excel spreadsheets and be able to view each clearly and easily because of the size.  I don't know about gaming, but I played a Blu Ray movie with my laptop and the image was awesome.Please read the description so you don't have to knock it stars because it doesn't have speakers.  if you want sound, buy speakers.

The deciding factor was the price.... $129  What a good deal!Size - 24 inch is perfect for my work areaPrice - $129 bucks during Newegg's President's day salePlug and play - nothing to set up.  My Dell and a home built PC (both purchased from Newegg!) detected the monitor perfectly and set the resolution without me doing a darn thing.

Why did Acer use a glossy bezel with a matte screen?  The whole point of a matte screen is that it reduces reflections!Turning down the brightness will automatically turn down the backlight.  The PWM waveform emits a slight buzz, which is audible if you have good high-frequency hearing.

Solid stand design, but basic.  You may need a screwdriver for the thumbscrews to assemble.","Cons:The screen is delicate,  perhaps all full LED monitors are like this, as these are my first non-LCD backlit I would not know.  The stand pivots, but does not adjust in height.  The settings buttons are a pain to navigate, but I have not had to set anything.","Other Thoughts:I got these on the President day sale.  I've wanted three for Eye-finity, but have always been reluctant to spend the cash.  I'm very happy.  Smooth and sharp, soft and brilliant.  These were very well designed economy monitors.  These were not as tall as tall as I anticipated, but 16:9 matches my TV, so no more format bars on format bars while watching movies.  I would pay full price for these.",0,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,"Acer 24"" Monitor",2014-02-16,"Pros:Honestly this is a pretty good monitor.. Although it doesn't have hdmi, you're going to have to go with the vga/dvi. If that really bothers you, you can do what I did and buy a vga to hdmi adapter, which is relatively inexpensive.I bought it last August (2013), and it's been working great for me, I'd say I've probably logged close to a thousand hours on it.Comes with everything you need pretty much, I'm not too good with tech but if you want a high quality monitor cheap, go for it. Would recommend to anyone. it's not a ridiculously large size either, if that's something you're concerned about.Noticed another reviewer talking about how the settings were annoying to adjust with (The ones you can mess with on the monitor itself).

No dead pixels, and no matter what angle you view it from the picture stays just as crisp and clear.",Cons:Can't really think of any cons.,"Other Thoughts:I saw a few not so great reviews, but I think some people are just over critical.

(I was looking at getting the LG IPS 27in but too many reviews said it was not bright enough.) I can't find a singe defect in the panel. Viewing angles are great. That's the one thing I hatted about all my previous TN panels. This is almost as fast and the colors are better. With the slim bezel three of these would look great on my desk. . It works well in portrait, something a TN panel can not do well. It does have a VESA mount so there are a lot of possibilities.",Cons:A better stand would be nice,Other Thoughts:1080p at three  foot away looks fine to me.I also looked at the Korean PLS screens. 1440p would be nice but it's almost twice the price and too risky for me.

When it's on sale, its price is pretty decent for the size.","Cons:I mostly bought this monitor for its size and the price it was at during the time of purchase. It was an upgrade from a 16"". Over past couple of years that I've owned it, I've definitely noticed a quality drop, even from the previous monitor. No matter the viewing angle, settings adjustments, etc, the colors always look washed out. As a graphic designer, this is a huge disadvantage because I can't get a full range of colors. Light colors are essentially white and dark ones might as well be black. Also, whites aren't exactly white either--they're more of a light gray.I've always been a fan of Acer, but this is just a bit of a disappointment.","Other Thoughts:If you need a large, cheap monitor, this is the one to buy.

Probably one of the best looking monitors I've seen in a while, and for the price I got it at (literally HALF of what I paid for my previous monitor) it was time for a change.",Cons:None to think of!,"Other Thoughts:My last monitor was a Samsung 216BW, which I've owned since 2007 and ran like a champ until recently... I still have it, it's somewhat defected now (transistor issue I believe); I plan on taking it to a repair shop to get it fixed, and I probably should have sooner (could have cost me less than buying a new monitor, maybe) but the price tag on a new monitor, like this one, that's also much larger in both physical size and native resolution was too tempting to pass up.

These replaced a 27"" AOC and the colors are much more vibrant and crisp. Ive been using the movie preset for now. All games that i play whether its a first person shooter, RPG, MMO or RTS I recieve beautiful quality. Mouting these monitors was also easy as they are light and thin so they are easily adjustable. I cannot comment on the stand as i have not used it but all 3 came perfectly, no problems, no dead pixels. Came a little bright out of the box but thats easily changeable. Overall good quality build, great color and good options and the fact that it comes with all the cables for optional use is another plus!","Cons:Menus are a little wierd but easy to get used to, also the blue LED on the power button so far i have not found if there is an option to disable it which isnt really a con, more of an annoyance in some cases. The power button also feels like it could break easily but it doesnt require much pressure to turn the monitors on or off. Holding up so far so good though and none of this i feel is any need to deduct any eggs. As long as you get it set up to your liking you are good to go! Also the placement of the input and power sticks straight out of the back so be sure you arent putting it right up against a wall or anything else as the cables stick out a good inch or so not including giving the cables room to bend so you arent internally pinching. No really a con for me because i have them mounted on a large L-shaped desk at least 5-6 inches away from anything behind it.",,0,0

It is also very lightweight, and the bezels are smaller than my other Acer monitors, which were already a nice size I thought.","Cons:The monitor stand is very small, but I haven't used it since I mounted it so it could be okay.The AC plug is some new fangled 3 pronged contraption and change is bad, but it works too.Lastly, the power button is kind of like a little hard plastic tab sticking out of the bottom, and it is obnoxiously bright. The menu/settings buttons are also on the bottom, but built into the monitor so not as bad but still hard to get used to.","Other Thoughts:Pretty solid monitor, and would have given 5 eggs if there wasn't one dead pixel and the defective policy is 5+.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,"Great price, great screen",2013-12-20,"Pros:- Screen is responsive and very bright- VERY thin.  i underestimated the thickness dimensions quite a bit. The dimensions listed are including the stand (so 6.66"" for stand base). The thickness is about 10mm.- Very low power consumption.  Leads to the monitor staying quite cool (temperature wise :P).- I prefer the gloss finish, some do not, i think it makes the monitor look sharp and prominent on the desk.","Cons:- View angle is very limited. Expected with non-IPS though- The stand is short compared to many other monitors i have used.- It's shown in the pictures, but the horizontal DVI/VGA input makes wall mounting difficult.- Screen is very prone to smudging and is difficult to clean.  Would leave me to believe there is no protective layering on the LCD screen.","Other Thoughts:Black friday deal, $99.99. wish i had bought 2 more.",1,0

This causes a color/gradient effect on solid color images (web pages, etc).Stand is quite short, will require you to set the monitor on something to really put it at eye level.","Other Thoughts:First attempt had a dead pixel located top middle of the screen. I didn't even get to use the monitor long enough to judge how the brightness/color levels were on the thing.The second one luckily had no dead pixels, but the bottom half of the monitor is brighter than the top. All manner of adjusting brightness/contrast/color doesn't really change this much.I'm trying to decide now to refund fully or just keep it as it was relatively cheap and maybe that's my fault for hoping for something better.The only good thing to come out of this was Newegg's quick RMA process and replacing of the original order.

No HDMI.,"Other Thoughts:I have this monitor hooked up to 2 computers.  One is coming in view DSUB and the other DVI and I switch back and forth as needed.  I mounted it on a Ergotron Neo-Flex stand and it works great.  It is very bright out of the box and requires some user calibration based on your needs.

I just loosened the nut on the hinge a tad and problem solved tho.","Other Thoughts:If you can get this on sale and need a simple 24"" monitor that looks great and you don't need a bunch of extra features do not hesitate to pick this up you will be very happy with this monitor.",1,0

Alot of people were complaining about stability issues with this monitor, it is a little wobly but not as bad as one would think ( it wobles just a tiny bit barely noticeable, even on my unsteady desk). Also I read a large amount of reviews about dead pixels, fortunately mine are all working.Another thought, the adjustment buttons are on the bottom like most monitors, however they are unmarked. When you press a button a little menu appears on the screen identifying which button is which. This is different but, for some could prove difficult, I personally don't mind it.",1,0

The price was great, and shipping was prompt. However, the unit arrived with dead pixels. I decided to RMA for a replacement. Unfortunately, Newegg sent me a refund instead. Apparently they ran out of stock. I sent an email asking for clarification and if I would eventually receive a replacement. No response yet after almost a week, which is extremely disappointing.

However, this is an infrequent problem beyond initial setup and calibration, and the stand is otherwise sturdy enough to resist my cat's nuzzling attempts, so I won't deduct an egg","Other Thoughts:I wasn't able to calibrate a proper black point and white point using only the monitor's built-in brightness and contrast tuning. I had to use my display driver's low level color correction to adjust these values. However, I had to do the same thing with my previous display so the issue may lie with my aging graphics card and its drivers. Regardless, I still achieved a properly-calibrated display so I wouldn't qualify this as a Con even if the issue stems from the monitor itself.",0,0

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Great inexpensive basic monitors,2013-12-06,"Pros:I've had a pair of these for around a year and have found them to be very nice basic monitors. I had to use the AMD VISION software that came with my cards to turn the brightness down and match the colors but it wasn't that big of a deal; I've had to do that with every monitor I've ever owned in the last 15 years. We have 5 more Acer monitors of different sizes in use in the business and the quality seems to be there. Several have been running for over 3 years without trouble.I haven't noticed any problems gaming with these G276HL monitors. Everything from Crysis 3, Bioshock 3, on down work fine. No ghosting, good response time, and the colors seem as good as some of the cheaper CRT's I used to use for Quake way back. I also use these for web development on occasion when not in the office and the colors are pretty close when I check with other devices. Responsive, no dead pixels yet on any of the Acers we have (a run of good luck I guess, from what I've read about flatscreens in general online). I recommend this monitor for anyone needing the real estate at a decent price. If you're coding games or doing serious graphic design, you probably already have something higher-end than these anyway.","Cons:My only complaint with these (and most modern monitors in general) is the hidden adjustment buttons. This might be an issue with boards having built-in graphics. I only use discreet graphics cards, primarily AMD, but both those and nVidia cards come with good calibration software so the on-monitor buttons aren't that essential. Speakers (or lack thereof) are completely unimportant to me; I have yet to listen to a monitor (or TV for that matter) with built-in speakers that sounded much better than an old transistor radio IMHO). That's what the sound provision on the motherboard or add-on card is for.","Other Thoughts:I've had other monitors that cost much more than this fail within a year (Westinghouse comes to mind; a pair of these in 22"" I think it was several years ago lasted less than 9 months and cost a lot more).This pair generally runs 24/7 and just sleeps overnight for 6 hours or so and never seem to run hot or have any issues to speak of. This monitor's not high end, but certainly not junk like some out there. For all-purpose large screen daily use (essential if your vision has tanked with age like mine), I really like this monitor. I can comfortably do everything I need to without emptying the wallet.",4,0

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Good enough for a reasonable price,2013-11-08,"Pros:Full HD, 5ms response time, good price, regular bezel (some are annoyingly wide), lightweight (because the power supply is on a brick outside the monitor), decent picture (to my untrained eye).","Cons:Limited adjustment, confusing assembly instructions, narrow viewing angle. No HDMI connector.","Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor just to hold me over until I can get a better one, and I knew what I was getting into, but still I must state it here: As others mentioned, the monitor does let you adjust the vertical angle, but not much, and the instructions were not that clear, so I had to use my common sense to figure out how to assemble the stand. IMO the viewing angle is narrow only vertically, horizontally it's a lot more wide, so I think there shouldn't be a problem with a multiple monitor setup unless you stack them one above another, and even then, all you have to do is angle it so it faces you. Some might not like to have the power guts outside the monitor, I just don't like to have another thing sit on my desk, and would rather see that inside the monitor so I don't need another cable, but it's not that big of a deal and I figure this was done to dissipate some of the heat from the capacitors, which is the thing that failed on another older Acer monitor I had (although replacing them was easy and it still works).In conclusion, this is a very decent monitor, maybe not an amazing one, but I'm very satisfied.",2,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,What it says on the tin...,2013-11-07,"Pros:Very crisp display, great for gaming.Accepts any signal once converted, as it is digital and analog.(Try not to use digital when possible though...)Design is clean and would compliment any desk.Power button looks very nice. (Clear plastic disk illuminated by a blue led.)Had the monitor for 5 months, still no dead pixels.23''-24'' is the sweet spot for 1080p.","Cons:24'' is the upper borderline for 1080p, and if you are used to a smaller display and have very good eyes, you may notice slight aliasing in images. This monitor does not smooth out the display by blending together pixels, although I would call that a pro.Viewing angles exactly as expected for being a TN panel, there is only 1 viewing angle :P This may be a con for some, but TN panels also respond faster, so are better for gaming in that respect.","Other Thoughts:This is a TN Panel, if you buy this expecting a large viewing angle, it was your own fault. Not the fault of this monitor. If you want everything to look smooth and pretty and could care less how it effects your gaming performance, look for an IPS panel.",12,2

I can always see the image, but it's often darker than it should be unless I move my head a little.","Other Thoughts:If I had originally planned on a surround setup, I probably would have looked for a monitor with a smaller bezel.

I'm really liking the quality, resolution, vibrant colors, etc. This is my first monitor for my first computer, so I can't compare much.","Cons:You can buy an HDMI equivalent for only $10 more, but I have gotten mixed responses on whether HDMI makes a difference. In my case, I'm using it for my gaming computer and the general consensus is that HDMI isn't necessary.Just keep that in mind when purchasing this monitor.","Other Thoughts:I have just had this for a week, so I'll re-review if anything goes wrong.

This is the best value on the market right now.  I use it for playing games (WoW, CSS, LoL, Skyrim) and movies.  Never had a problem with the picture going choppy or blurry or anything.

Very happy with this purchase","Cons:The brightness is some what of a con, if you use this computer in a room with somebody sleeping its like sleeping in the middle of the day for them. I am sure you can dim the monitor but they fact that the only user manual you get is a disc that sends you to a website that doesnt work isnt so great.","Other Thoughts:over all i am very pleased with this, just wish they had better support for the products they sell.

The viewing angles are ok, but these might not be the best for a tri monitor setup. Came with a dvi and vga cable (using the DVI).","Cons:The screen Wobbles…alot. If I shake my desk, then the screen will wobble for about 3 sec. And you have to hold the monitor in place while using the buttons, which are the only large con. The buttons are extremely hard to use, and just don’t feel right, but nothing to take an egg off for.","Other Thoughts:The screen was set to 100% Brightness, which is x2 times brighter than the sun. I had to set the monitor to 40% before I could are to look at the screen. Also if you are AMD catalyst user I would suggest turning the contrast to 115%, it just looks better that wayPlayed some games and they looked great (dead space 3, BF3, GW2)rig:i7 3770k3 gb 797012 gb ddr3 1600 ram",1,0

The viewing angles aren't the greatest but you can't expect much from a $120 screen. If you sit straight in front of it, it's not a big worry.","Other Thoughts:I haven't tried it but I doubt that buying multiple of these for a dual or triple screen set up would be a good idea. I don't think you'd be able to have the right viewing angle for all three screens. If you don't mind spending an extra $30-40, you can get something MUCH better.",2,0

I have my monitor sitting about 6-7"" higher than the desk itself and you can see that it gets a little washed out if you don't sit high enough.

Made me want to buy one, and still might buy another one for a second monitor for my set up.Has a good picture, especially for the price. So totally worth it for $150","Cons:No HDMI port. But isn't a huge deal to me really.Also what makes this so light is that the power supply is on the cord and thus uses a different cable than most monitors do.But again, neither of these are huge issues to my girlfriend.","Other Thoughts:It does everything it needs to do, has a good picture and is still working after a few months.",0,0
Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),4,Great Value,2013-08-25,"Pros:Hi Resolution, good contrast, acceptable response time. I've had the monitor for almost 8 months and it has worked very well for me. I use it in tandem with a 32"" 3D HDTV. So the monitor is for web browsing, music production and applications and the TV for movies and gaming.(although I do game on the monitor about 40% of the time). I have no regrets buying this monitor and I'd buy another one for the price.","Cons:As others have said the viewing angle is not good at all, but I only use it when stationed at my desk, so I rarely even notice. For a work station its not an issue. For viewing movies...well look elsewhere.","Other Thoughts:Its a 1080, 5ms, 600:1 contrast LED monitor for under $150.... its hard to put all those things in one sentence and not give a good review.

The bezel is a gloss black and is prone to finger prints if you are a touchy feely kinda person.",Cons:At this price point and with ACERs excellent customer service and warranty there are no cons.,"Other Thoughts:This is a budget 24"" monitor.  You cant complain unless you feel like it should have features that monitors $100 more should have.  The menu buttons could be cumber-sum to those less tech savvy.  In the matter of 15 seconds I figured out how to enter and navigate thru all menus.  Led technology allows this monitor to be on for days and never be warm to the touch.  After 3 ACER monitor purchases over the last 4-5 years I've never had a dead pixel.

This a huuuuge upgrade (obviously) - and I got 2 of them for the price of the 1 22"" I bought in 2007 ($130 each /w free shipping).

Not worth taking off an egg in my opinion. Also, this is acceptable for the price, but no HDMI.","Other Thoughts:While it's definitely not the best 1080p you'll ever see, it's low price, and has pretty good colors and detail.I have a terrible tendency to slouch and lounge while using the computer, so I would have preferred it to be able to tilt more forward, but it's probably good that it encourages me to sit upright.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),5,Must Have,2013-08-09,"Pros:Beautiful picture out of the box, no need to tinker with settings.Very crisp bright steady image.","Cons:External power supply - Though not really a con, the power supply is not built in and it does not use a standard computer AC power cable. However, if the power supply fails it would certainly be easier to replace than one built in.The viewing angle isn't great, but this doesn't bother me because I am looking straight at my monitor. For some this may be an issue, if you get about 45 degrees off to the side the image begins to fade.","Other Thoughts:I used to purchase Hanns-G monitors, because they seemed to work fine and were a lower cost item. My last two however failed after a few months and were not great when they did work. I have always purchased Acer Laptops for my company, and decided to give their monitors a shot.

For everything I use it for it serves just fine.HOWEVER, if you do anything sensitive to color (photography, graphic design, art, etc.) you'll want to spend more on something better suited to that.Can you read text on it? Sure, you could even look down the side and it's still perfectly readable. The trouble is with color. Shift your viewing angle even one degree and the color temperature changes drastically. It's so extreme that looking at a solid gray screen will seem to have different colors at the edges than the middle until you move your head a bit.If it didn't have that issue, this would be perfect. The menus are a little funky and the speakers are cheap, but nobody touches the menus again once they finish initial setup and nobody who cares about sound quality uses speakers built in to a monitor.

Unfortunately, it did not have VESA mount points (something I thought I had researched, but it seems to be an afterthought to most) so I was unable to use it for its intended purpose.  So, my son ended up with a new 23"" monitor and I used his 21"" for the time being.  In general, it's a decent monitor for the money, but the incredibly narrow viewing angle (more than 15degress off center and you get color shifting) bothers me.

So it works great for that, but I would not recommend this if you seeking a high end quality monitor.  The contrast is a bit off on this screen, corners appear brighter sometimes. If you're doing anything in graphic designing, game development, picture editing, etc. then this monitor is not for you.  Seek something that provides HD quality and HDMI connections.  Our users work mostly in Office and database programs, so we have no need for high quality contrast and coloring.The base assembly was a bit confusing at first, but you have to angle the part when pushing it in.

What's the point in making 1320x1280 display with .24 dot pitch if you're going to muddy it up with a matte finish? To reduce glare? That's so weak it's pathetic. All you have to do is turn your monitor 1 degree and the glare is gone. It's not like monitors are still giant and heavy to move. Believe me, a gloss screen shows your colors and details much sharper than matte. If matte is better, then why is it when things look blurry (matte), that your eye doctor gives you glasses to correct it? :)The little power brick died suddenly today. I went to Acer's support site and got on the chat. The tech was very nice, and quickly agreed to send me a new one. That was totally refreshing.Monitors this thin bust be lit by ""side firing"" LED's instead of full back lighting. That's the price you pay for thin. Very thin monitors can be well executed, but take more powerful  LED's. I still recommend this monitor, but only if you're on a very low budget.",0,2

Now I don't have much to base my knowledge off of, because I rarely buy monitors. But this monitor works just fine.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),1,Washed Out,2013-01-05,Pros:Cheap and easy to install.,"Cons:Horrible Picture. The washed out picture is the worst I've ever seen. I didn't even know it was possible for a monitor to display such a horrible quality picture. I'm the type of guy who doesn't care about high end graphics or that HD garbage, so my standards are pretty low, but this is just bad...","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these, one for home and an extra one at work. I bought acer because I have an old acer 19"" LCD monitor that has worked great for years until it started doing this continuous auto adjust screen thing all the time which started to get annoying. So I bought 2 of these and out of the box the picture looked horrendous. Everything looks like if you were to take a picture into Photoshop and set the opacity to 50%. None of the colors seem clear and everything looks foggy/smokey. This appears both on the one I installed at home and the one at work. If you play around with the tilt angel, things become a little clearer, but this is really unacceptable for a monitor. I've messed around for a couple of hours playing with the brightness/contrast controls, both on the monitor and my NVIDIA settings. I also tried the windows color calibration tool. There was a slight improvement after tweaking these settings for a few hours, but honestly, there is no way I can use this monitor. The faded color simply kills my eyes. Sadly, I bought two of these at the same time and have no way to return them as I purchased them through an allowance at my job. What a waste of my allowance!After doing a little research online, I think this might simply be a problem with LED back-lit monitors and could be unrelated to the acer brand. I'm going to have to replace at least the one I have at home as just trying to type this text and reading it is straining my eyes on this monitor. I'm going to be sure the one I buy tomorrow is an old traditional LCD with NO LED back-lit what so ever, and I will buy a different brand just to be safe.",3,2

I saw these monitor for cheap I couldn't resist. After a long wait they came in and all I could hope for was that my peer owners were exaggerating about the quality. Sadly they were not...I was very displeased when comparing my Acer S232HLAbid side by side to this monitor. I tried for hours to fixed the issues but the monitor just doesn't have the resources to get there. Lucky after setting up the triple display I was very happy with the outcome. It makes every game extremely immersive and I have my high end acer in the middle to get great picture while these two sit on the sides. When playing triple monitors you still only focus on the middle monitor, the other two are there to add immersion. Overall I wouldn't recommend this monitor for main use.

It is true that this monitor is lower in video quality compared with more expensive 23"" I also have sitting on my desk.  Color adjustment options on monitor is very limited, and colors can realistically only be adjusted from graphic card control panel.  Also convergence of green/blue/red component was off.  However, for the price, I find it hard to complain.  It's perfectly fine for watching video or as secondary monitor.  Also monitor stand tilts back so it's easy to get good viewing angle.

Acer,G246HLAbd (UM.FG6AA.A01),1,Avoid this unless you want junk,2012-12-28,"Pros:Large screen, high def","Cons:Everything else.  The base is odd, but stable I suppose.  The thing that gets me is the screen.  Blacks aren't black, they are gray.  Everything is washed out looking, the colors are awful and the viewing angle is absurd.  Usually you can get rid of the overbright and garish colors with some tinkering, but I had it for 3 hours trying to adjust the brightness and color and couldn't find a single arrangement to make my blacks black.  Without black, games and movies have a horrible blur in them, so the resolution is great, if you don't mind a lot of blur, which kind of defeats the purpose of HD.  The menus are also mostly disabled, which wasn't mentioned in the previous reviews.","Other Thoughts:I should have paid attention to what others were saying about this boat anchor.  I'm now stuck with an RMA, which means I paid 10 bucks for shipping it to my house, 10 bucks back to newegg, and newegg is taking an extra 20 off the refund for my trouble.Avoid this unless you want a costly rental of trash.  Spend the extra 40 bucks and get a good monitor, or you'll spend it anyway and have nothing to show for it.

Perfect views in lighted colors though.","Other Thoughts:A lot of people complained about washed out colors...? not really sure if these people are stupid but a small amount of adjusting the brightness down (100 to 50) and contrast up (50 to 70) clears the picture right up.Looks great on games like League of Legends, The Secret World, Lotro, War Z etc. no problems at all (except night time in War Z, almost unplayable due to the LED on the bottom half of the screen.)",1,0

So far I can tell you that 3M's heavy duty mounting tape does not work for attaching them to a VESA-based mount, although they were all considerate enough to only fall down while I was watching them and to do it slowly enough that I could catch them. Whether I'll have better luck with Polyurethane glue remains to be seen. If it doesn't work I'm thinking of trying to sew a jacket for it which could then be attached to the mount.

Its actually difficult to look at for long periods of time.It is super thin but the DVI cord they ship, sticks out about 2 inches straight out the back, so doesn't really do much to have a super thin monitor if the cord sticks out so far.","Other Thoughts:We're a graphics company and we were going to use this in our main lobby to show clients sample graphics.

It's also a wide screen monitor so the 24"" is much smaller than you expect for a regular monitor.Additionally, the base is cheap and does not allow height adjustment, which means you have to stack it on reams of paper until you find a monitor stand.

LG,32MU99-W,3,Third time's a charm?,2018-12-27,Pros:- sharp and bright display- multiple and custom color profiles- clean appearance with the thin bezels and matte finish,Cons:- back-light/screen quality is a gamble- manufacturing quality is questionable,"Other Thoughts:I am on the third monitor in a month, trying to find one that works well and can display colors accurately for photography work. The first one was a dream until two weeks in and a roughly 1-inch vertical band of blue pixels started flickering on the right side of the monitor. The second monitor suffered from a very obvious yellow-green color shift on the left side, making white balancing photos impossible and contributing to an ugly experience with other content.The current monitor I am on seems fine so far, though I am only about an hour in using it.

I really never use them but the do work well.,Cons:- HDR is just plain awful.  Do not even think to turn it on.  No matter what I tried HDR on with the image quality was extremely washed out.- You have to update the firmware for the monitor to work properly.  The monitor will randomly go black for one second if you do not.- The price.  Honestly this monitor is not worth the price.,Other Thoughts:So to sum it up.  Would I recommend this to a friend?  The short answer is no.  Also would I buy this again.  I would have to say no.  Honestly there is really nothing special that makes this worth more than other monitors on the market.  Yes the image quality is spot on.  The colors are also very crisp.  But I am sure there are better ways to spend the extra $ on.   What would make this monitor a little more valuable and I would add stars to it.- Swap FreeSync for Gsync- Remove HDR10 and lower the price- Now if it would swap FreeSync for Gsync as well as remove HDR and lower the price.  This monitor would easily be a 5 star.I have used this monitor since May of this year.  I purposely waited a bit to write the review.   Hopefully this helps you to make the decision easier.

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,Excellent for the price,2019-03-19,"Pros:- Cost.  When on sale, this monitor is an excellent deal for the price.- Number and variety of inputs: DP, Mini-DP, and 2xHDMI- Good viewing angles.- 18 months without trouble so far.- Audio allows for headphone/line out.- Supports ancient video resolutions.  DOS at 43"" is amazing!","Cons:- Brighter than the sun.  You'll burn your retinas at anything over about 12 on the brightness, which doesn't leave much dynamic range in the adjustment for fine-tuning.- Controls are all in the rear.  This monitor is huge, thus you need to sit back from it.  Adjusting the controls (like selecting an input) basically requires you to stand and lean awkwardly over the desk.  Front-mounted controls on a little pouty lip on the lower right would have been much better.- Audio passthrough can be a bit noisy at times, but I tolerate it for the convenience.","Other Thoughts:- Image persistence is real.  It is not burn-in; this is due to charge build-up in the panel, which dissipates given time.  Lowering your brightness from nuclear fusion to tolerable-to-the-human-eye will help a lot.  Hint: if you're playing games, the image is changing rapidly--so no image retention except perhaps around the HUD.  Not A Big Deal to me.- The ""black screen issue"": I have a sub-second glitch every two months or so.  Buy good-quality DisplayPort cables rated for DP 1.3 (1.4 for HDR support)!- I have not tested HDR; still rocking a GTX 750 on my main machine, which predates HDR.- If you're using analog 2 or 2.1 speakers, connect them to the monitor.  Then direct all your connected devices to output audio via DP/HDMI.  Now when you switch monitor inputs, the audio will follow.  Hey presto!  Built-in A/V switch.- My setup: DP (main desktop @ 4K); Mini-DP (laptop @ 4K); HDMI1 (NAS @ 1080p or Tandy 1000 through a VGA D-sub to HDMI converter at 640x480, 720x400, 800x600, etc.); HDMI2 (RPi @ 1080p).",0,0

Mine does not seem quite as bad, I get a blackout about every other day on average, but it is quite annoying when it happens.  Hence the four egg review.  I use my monitor at work so it is mainly an annoyance but the fact this issue seems fairly common is discouraging me from buying a second one for home use and gaming.If this is a design issue with the monitor then it seems too risky to purchase a new one and perhaps having the issue occur more frequently, particularly given the investment.

With customized resolutions i get any monitor I want with this one.","Cons:I would pay more for a remote, since I adjust the  settings a lot when setting it up.Looking across the monitor from center to left there seems to be slight color change slightly more red, its not really noticeable looking to the right, probably not  noticeable for pictures or video. I'm trying to write computer programs on this with a lot of white background and very small print.","Other Thoughts:-This a great monitor, I am using an PNY GeForce 1050 GTX Ti video card and bought a 4K HDMI cable.-We have 2 Acer 48"" like this at work and I have 1 at home, all are very good. I like this monitor better because I can create a large drawing or view 8  pages in Word horizontally at the same time. There is plenty of screen and I can still read it even though everything is smaller.-Text with resolution at native 4K, 3840x2160 is just fine, but 10% smaller than you are used to on a 24"" monitor. You can use it this way out of the box.-I use my computer for almost 100% text, the fine adjustments below are not necessary for video or web surfing.---------For those using almost all text (programmers / office workers) , and you want larger text than 3840x2160 gives you, here' how to make custom resolutions--------When purchasing a monitor smaller than 48"", everything will be smaller. Windows has scaling but from my experience scaling scales all the monitors, so that doesn't work for me. You can create custom resolutions per monitor on the GeForce 1050 and some laptop Intel hardware that will allow you to increase the size of everything by creating a less than 3840x2160 resolution. 4 24"" monitors 1920x1080 are the same as a 48"" monitor but the sides are so far away the background becomes grayer. I have used one and if that's what you need, great, the text will look exactly like what it did on the 24"" monitors.-Note when using less than or equal to Calibri 10 at 100% in an app with these custom resolutions, it is harder to get the text to be perfect, but this below will yield very good text.  A lot of other common fonts doesn't have this problem.-How do you do this: in excel  ROUND(2160*16/9, 4) = 3840 but ROUND(2159*16/9, 4) = 3838.2 (this does not work, note the answer is not a whole number), but ROUND(2151*16/9, 4) = 3824 does work. In GeForce control panel go to Display then Change resolution then Customize then Create Custom Resolution. The trick here is after entering the horzontal and vertical numbers click the drop down with Automatic in it and choose CVT-Reduced Blank (stay away from manual unless you know what to put there). After clicking test and you can see it, click ok, this doesn't change the screen, it puts this resolution in the Customize window. Check that one, then go back to the list of resolutions you can normally pick from, choose it, then Apply to make the screen change. On a 43"" monitor, 3440x1935 resolution yields all of the objects on the screen the same you see on a 24"" 1920x1080 screen but now the text is bolder (in text editors).-Try these settings (not needed at 4K resolution) to get you started, to make the text more like what you see on a 24"" screen. Use refresh 60p on a good video card, 29p on a laptop that can not support 59p or 60p. For Intel Video check Maintain Aspect Ratio, disable IT Content, Quantization Range = Full, color YCbCr. On the monitor: Super Sharp On, Black Boost 10, Brightness 8, Contrast 70; User color mode: Gamma 1.8, Red/Green/Blue bias 12.  Maybe Red 46, Green 49, Blue 40. If you have an NVIDA video card: Display > Change resolution: use NVDIA color settings, don't change the settings. Then in Adjust desktop color settings: Use NVDIA settings, contrast 50%, gamma 1.1.-There are Windows settings like Smooth edges of fonts, dpi scaling per application (use this if your taskbar > right click app >  right click app > properties > tab Compatiblity exists (it does on Chrome), and also there is 'adjust clear type' you might experiment with.-For any monitor blue reduces readablity, I reduced the blue a little making it easier to read for me.

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,Experienced none of the issues other users have reported,2019-01-25,"Pros:I bought this monitor with my fingers crossed after reading through the other reviews. In the end, it was just too good of a deal to pass up. I'm glad I took the risk. I've experienced none of the issues with the screen blanking *or* the screen burn users are talking about. I've been extra vigilant for both and it seems I've got a good panel. I'm rating this monitor four stars because it's big and beautiful but...","Cons:It doesn't offer any kind of adaptive sync. I kicked myself when NVidia announced G-Sync support on Freesync monitors because this display just can't take advantage of it. For the price, I still think it's a good deal but sheesh. What terrible timing for me personally on that one.","Other Thoughts:A couple notes: the blanking issue seems to be when people are using DisplayPort. I have been using the a normal 4k60 cable I bought for $10 and have experienced none of that. I also don't doubt anyone who says they have it or have experienced screen burn. For perspective, I'm a writer and gamer. I will often spend three hours at a pop on a nice white Google Doc. If anyone would be primed to see burn in, you would think it would be me, but I'm lucky.

I play mostly FPS and war games like Battlefield so the size is optimal for that.

Other people have reported the same issue on large format 4k monitors using display port. The black screen problem is not unique to this monitor. Others have had the same problem with the 43 inch 4k LG monitor also. The solution is to switch over to HDMI because the problem is not present with HDMI. It may be a firmware problem with display port that causes the intermittent black screen. Had I known this I never would have returned my monitor for RMA. The replacement they sent at first had a large group of dead pixels. Acer agreed to replace that monitor and covered shipping. I am waiting to receive my final replacement.  Acer has done everything possible to address my needs..,Other Thoughts:Dianne with Acer corporate customer support has been very helpful in making sure my RMA was addressed properly.

I do not own the ET430k  monitor.,"Other Thoughts:Greetings, I came to these reviews because the monitor is on sale via email deals. I eventually want to replace my 10 year old Samsung LN40A630 but am waiting for a 43"" oled tv or an LED tv or monitor that has good off axis viewing because my wife uses my monitor as a TV when she gets ready for work in the morning and most of the new 4K LED tv's have poor off axis viewing.  This old 1080P tv has surprisingly good off axis viewing.  Well, to the point, in the past month or 2 I have been experiencing the same black screen where the screen goes black and then comes back on again.  It is completely random and can happen as few as one or 2 times or as many as 6 to 12 before it stops blacking out.  This morning it got into a fit of about 8 blackouts and I was not doing anything except email and MS Edge. I am experiencing this on an HP Z420 workstation running windows 10 pro with an AMD R9 380 card that uses 2 6 pin pcie power cables.  I read comments about how someone resolved this issue by replacing one of the power supply 6 pin cables with a 6 pin adapter powered by sata or molex.  This did not help so I moved the card to the second PCIE X16 slot on the board and thought this had solved the problem as I have not noticed the problem in a week or 2 until this morning!  So I am beginning to believe that The problem is the video card, power supply or conflict between AMD and Windows 10.  Can any folks reading this who are having this problem, respond to this or post a similar review and indicate if you are running windows 10 with AMD cards and what type of Motherboard? Perhaps we can find a pattern here to finally help all having this problem and potentially eliminate the monitor as a suspect.  Additionally I have a Windows 7 pro dell T3600 with AMD rx 580 card that is not experiencing this problem using the same Samsung LN 40A630 tv. Just blanked out twice while typing the previous sentence.  :-O Thanks, Bob",1,5

As others have posted, you don't really understand how large it is unless you have previously hooked your PC up to a 40+ inch TV.  I have done this in the past, and outside of the fact that response times for gaming was kind of laggy and I had a lot slower Graphics card back then, the size I had expected, I had just forgotten how big.- The Detail. Its 4k and a glorious 4k it is. I am using a GTX 970 and as soon as prices come down on graphics cards I will be upgrading. I went from Ultra settings in BF4 to Medium/low settings. The resolution is great, but I had to lower resolution back to 1080p in games.- Colors are very vibrant and there are many options.  I had expected a remote control with this due to many reviews on Youtube referencing this monitor but showing reviews for the LG version of this monitor.","Cons:- As others have pointed out, there is some ghosting when displaying bright white for a while and then going to a grey screen, but honestly for anyone who owns any recent OLED screen on a cellphone, THEY ALL HAVE THIS PROBLEM. It is not permanent and it is not distracting. Believe me, you will get over it.-  As I pointed out earlier, I thought this came with a remote. The buttons and input settings are fine, but I like to use the gaming reticle and i have to reach around the back to turn it on whenever I game in FPS games.- The back is beautiful but the inputs are sparse. Two HDMI, one mini DP and one DP. It suffices for me, but if you are looking for hooking up 3 or more devices, you should look at the LG version of this monitor.- Scaling. I love being able to look at larger windows. My eyesight is not what it once was, so with this monitor I don't have to wear my computer glasses. That being said the scaling makes large borders around webpages and media players and the real estate of a web page is not filled such. It isn't the fault of this monitor, it is just the nature of large format monitors and internet coding.","Other Thoughts:Edit: I am updating my review after 9 months. While the Monitor continues to look as vibrant as the day I bought it, I am experiencing black screen issues when the monitor will blank out for about a second. It happens randomly. I am afraid that in about 3 months I will be out of warranty.... then what?  Its a shame that such a thing happens to an otherwise outstanding monitor.",3,0

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,1,Beautiful monitor with connection issues,2018-11-30,"Pros:Beautifully bright and high resolution, makes things look fantastic when it works.","Cons:Has an intermittent flickering issue that shows itself at random, (worse when playing a full-screen game) where the monitor will appear to disconnect from the PC, and reconnect 2-3 seconds later.  This issue cannot be repaired by using a new displayport cable, and only temporary relief can be found by switching the monitor from displayport mode 1.1->1.2.  If you attempt to get it fixed by Acer they will refuse to provide shipping for the 300$ shipping cost to get it repaired in Texas.","Other Thoughts:Buy one if you feel like playing Russian roulette on build quality, I won't be buying another Acer product again.",4,0

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,Giant Monitor of Doom,2018-10-18,"Pros:- It makes the Washington Monument look like a lawn gnome. People who walk into your office will always comment on the size. ALWAYS.- It's so bright I thought the sun was going nova when I booted into Windows.- Sturdy. It overhangs my desk and I keep bumping into it because I'm an idiot, and I haven't broken it yet.","Cons:- It's still just a 60hz monitor, but it's like $450. What did you expect, mang? Angels singing a chorus and Alyssa Milano in a bikini?- You have to have tiny hands to get the freaking power cord in the socket. When I get excited, I put the blood bank on emergency alert. So needless to say, I don't have small hands. The wife helped, though.","Other Thoughts:So this monitor is sharp, came with no dead pixels I could find, it's very bright, and the construction is solid and sturdy. It's stylish too, though the white plastic will be your enemy if you're a ridiculous slob (don't ask me how I know this). If you need a gigantic 4k monitor for work - or just want some screen size bragging rights on HardOCP - by all means, buy this. If you're one of those crazy gamers who must brag about 3097207 fps in some game, though, this monitor is not for you. Buy a 144hz monitor instead. Good luck finding a large 4k screen at this price point with a refresh rate that high, though. I don't know if they even make one. If they do, you'll have to donate a nut for scientific research in order to pay for it, though. This is $450. Seriously. The value is obvious. Best deal out there - at least when I was looking.It's a matter of priorities. What is more important to you? Speed or size? You know the right answer to that, my man.",6,4
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,Great 43 inch 4k IPS monitor for the price,2018-10-18,"Pros:Great monitor for the price, bought it during a Newegg shellshocker deal for $359.Image retention can be reduced greatly if the brightness is adjusted correctly.Have not seen any black screen issues reported by others. I run a Nvidia video card under Linux.Honestly, 43"" is really too big to be a desk monitor, but this monitor is excellent for CAD work or reducing eye strain when concentrating on fine detailed work.","Cons:The 100x200 VESA mounting is small for most TV mounts, this monitor was designed for regular desk monitor mounts. The back of the monitor is not flat and only has 2"" of clearance below the bottom two screw mounts and the top of the wider bottom portion of the monitor case. I ended up cutting off the bottom of the TV mounting plate that came with my wall mount to make it fit with the monitor.Wish it came with a DVI input or a DVI output to HDMI input cable or adapter.","Other Thoughts:For wall mounting options, I wish the monitor back was flat and the mounting screws set at a larger size like 400x400 to fit with most TV wall mounts.",0,1
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,2,"Great monitor, but black screen issue is real",2018-10-16,"Pros:The monitor itself looks great. It freed up a lot of desk space since I have it all the way back on my desk. I haven't experienced the image retention issues that others have talked about, but haven't gone looking for it either.","Cons:I also experience the black screen issue, where every now and then it blacks out for a couple seconds. I'm connected over the DisplayPort input to a GTX 960. This is a pretty big deal, hence the two eggs.",,2,0
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,1,Love the monitor but I am also having problem with black screen.,2018-10-15,Pros:Love the 4k and HDR,Cons:Mild screen retention but fades fairly fast and not a big deal for me.  Black screen periodically can be annoying!!! - 1 star for this.  If problem is able to be fixed it would be 5 stars all the way!!!!  Manufacturer responds to everybody but me.  Guess my money didn't count!!!,Other Thoughts:I've been having the black screen issue also and thought maybe it was the GPU but was using on 1080ti and now have the 2080ti and have the same black screen every so often.  I saw others having the same problem and that the vendor has responded to them to have a solution.  I've had the unit for a year in November so have 2 years + on the warranty.  Acer please help with my monitor also.  Thank you for a great product other then the black screen problem.  Down to 1 star related to manufacture not wanting to respond to my request for help with my monitor.,3,0
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,Excellent for the price,2019-03-19,"Pros:- Cost.  When on sale, this monitor is an excellent deal for the price.- Number and variety of inputs: DP, Mini-DP, and 2xHDMI- Good viewing angles.- 18 months without trouble so far.- Audio allows for headphone/line out.- Supports ancient video resolutions.  DOS at 43"" is amazing!","Cons:- Brighter than the sun.  You'll burn your retinas at anything over about 12 on the brightness, which doesn't leave much dynamic range in the adjustment for fine-tuning.- Controls are all in the rear.  This monitor is huge, thus you need to sit back from it.  Adjusting the controls (like selecting an input) basically requires you to stand and lean awkwardly over the desk.  Front-mounted controls on a little pouty lip on the lower right would have been much better.- Audio passthrough can be a bit noisy at times, but I tolerate it for the convenience.","Other Thoughts:- Image persistence is real.  It is not burn-in; this is due to charge build-up in the panel, which dissipates given time.  Lowering your brightness from nuclear fusion to tolerable-to-the-human-eye will help a lot.  Hint: if you're playing games, the image is changing rapidly--so no image retention except perhaps around the HUD.  Not A Big Deal to me.- The ""black screen issue"": I have a sub-second glitch every two months or so.  Buy good-quality DisplayPort cables rated for DP 1.3 (1.4 for HDR support)!- I have not tested HDR; still rocking a GTX 750 on my main machine, which predates HDR.- If you're using analog 2 or 2.1 speakers, connect them to the monitor.  Then direct all your connected devices to output audio via DP/HDMI.  Now when you switch monitor inputs, the audio will follow.  Hey presto!  Built-in A/V switch.- My setup: DP (main desktop @ 4K); Mini-DP (laptop @ 4K); HDMI1 (NAS @ 1080p or Tandy 1000 through a VGA D-sub to HDMI converter at 640x480, 720x400, 800x600, etc.); HDMI2 (RPi @ 1080p).",0,0
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,Confirming black screen issue,2019-03-12,"Pros:Very nice colors and size.  Just about perfect for having multiple documents open for editing and not having to sit across the room or strain your neck to see the sides of the screen.  The monitor is not inexpensive, but a really good deal for the price.","Cons:I was looking to buy a second monitor of the same type and in reading the reviews I see that lots of other folks are having the same issue I do of the monitor blacking out randomly.  Mine does not seem quite as bad, I get a blackout about every other day on average, but it is quite annoying when it happens.  Hence the four egg review.  I use my monitor at work so it is mainly an annoyance but the fact this issue seems fairly common is discouraging me from buying a second one for home use and gaming.If this is a design issue with the monitor then it seems too risky to purchase a new one and perhaps having the issue occur more frequently, particularly given the investment.

Extremely frustrating, and it only seems to get worse.

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,"Great Monitor, How to make custom resolutions",2019-01-26,"Pros:I like the size, I have worked on a 48"" 4K, but I can read text on this at 4K. 48"" monitors are harder to read at the far away edges. With customized resolutions i get any monitor I want with this one.","Cons:I would pay more for a remote, since I adjust the  settings a lot when setting it up.Looking across the monitor from center to left there seems to be slight color change slightly more red, its not really noticeable looking to the right, probably not  noticeable for pictures or video. I'm trying to write computer programs on this with a lot of white background and very small print.","Other Thoughts:-This a great monitor, I am using an PNY GeForce 1050 GTX Ti video card and bought a 4K HDMI cable.-We have 2 Acer 48"" like this at work and I have 1 at home, all are very good. I like this monitor better because I can create a large drawing or view 8  pages in Word horizontally at the same time. There is plenty of screen and I can still read it even though everything is smaller.-Text with resolution at native 4K, 3840x2160 is just fine, but 10% smaller than you are used to on a 24"" monitor. You can use it this way out of the box.-I use my computer for almost 100% text, the fine adjustments below are not necessary for video or web surfing.---------For those using almost all text (programmers / office workers) , and you want larger text than 3840x2160 gives you, here' how to make custom resolutions--------When purchasing a monitor smaller than 48"", everything will be smaller. Windows has scaling but from my experience scaling scales all the monitors, so that doesn't work for me. You can create custom resolutions per monitor on the GeForce 1050 and some laptop Intel hardware that will allow you to increase the size of everything by creating a less than 3840x2160 resolution. 4 24"" monitors 1920x1080 are the same as a 48"" monitor but the sides are so far away the background becomes grayer. I have used one and if that's what you need, great, the text will look exactly like what it did on the 24"" monitors.-Note when using less than or equal to Calibri 10 at 100% in an app with these custom resolutions, it is harder to get the text to be perfect, but this below will yield very good text.  A lot of other common fonts doesn't have this problem.-How do you do this: in excel  ROUND(2160*16/9, 4) = 3840 but ROUND(2159*16/9, 4) = 3838.2 (this does not work, note the answer is not a whole number), but ROUND(2151*16/9, 4) = 3824 does work. In GeForce control panel go to Display then Change resolution then Customize then Create Custom Resolution. The trick here is after entering the horzontal and vertical numbers click the drop down with Automatic in it and choose CVT-Reduced Blank (stay away from manual unless you know what to put there). After clicking test and you can see it, click ok, this doesn't change the screen, it puts this resolution in the Customize window. Check that one, then go back to the list of resolutions you can normally pick from, choose it, then Apply to make the screen change. On a 43"" monitor, 3440x1935 resolution yields all of the objects on the screen the same you see on a 24"" 1920x1080 screen but now the text is bolder (in text editors).-Try these settings (not needed at 4K resolution) to get you started, to make the text more like what you see on a 24"" screen. Use refresh 60p on a good video card, 29p on a laptop that can not support 59p or 60p. For Intel Video check Maintain Aspect Ratio, disable IT Content, Quantization Range = Full, color YCbCr. On the monitor: Super Sharp On, Black Boost 10, Brightness 8, Contrast 70; User color mode: Gamma 1.8, Red/Green/Blue bias 12.  Maybe Red 46, Green 49, Blue 40. If you have an NVIDA video card: Display > Change resolution: use NVDIA color settings, don't change the settings. Then in Adjust desktop color settings: Use NVDIA settings, contrast 50%, gamma 1.1.-There are Windows settings like Smooth edges of fonts, dpi scaling per application (use this if your taskbar > right click app >  right click app > properties > tab Compatiblity exists (it does on Chrome), and also there is 'adjust clear type' you might experiment with.-For any monitor blue reduces readablity, I reduced the blue a little making it easier to read for me. Blue blocker / glare resistent glasses are the way to go.-Have fun",0,1
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,Experienced none of the issues other users have reported,2019-01-25,"Pros:I bought this monitor with my fingers crossed after reading through the other reviews. In the end, it was just too good of a deal to pass up. I'm glad I took the risk. I've experienced none of the issues with the screen blanking *or* the screen burn users are talking about. I've been extra vigilant for both and it seems I've got a good panel. I'm rating this monitor four stars because it's big and beautiful but...","Cons:It doesn't offer any kind of adaptive sync. I kicked myself when NVidia announced G-Sync support on Freesync monitors because this display just can't take advantage of it. For the price, I still think it's a good deal but sheesh. What terrible timing for me personally on that one.","Other Thoughts:A couple notes: the blanking issue seems to be when people are using DisplayPort. I have been using the a normal 4k60 cable I bought for $10 and have experienced none of that. I also don't doubt anyone who says they have it or have experienced screen burn. For perspective, I'm a writer and gamer. I will often spend three hours at a pop on a nice white Google Doc. If anyone would be primed to see burn in, you would think it would be me, but I'm lucky. This monitor is a roll of the dice but just know that there *are* success stories out there.",1,0
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,"A good product despite difficulties with black screen issue.  (black screen caused by display port issue, not monitor itself.)",2019-01-18,"Pros:Very large, fast response rate, OSD crosshair for FPS players, multiple inputs. I play mostly FPS and war games like Battlefield so the size is optimal for that. I don't use the internal speakers because I don't need them.",Cons:I went through the RMA process for the black screen issue only to learn that this is not an issue with the monitor itself but an issue with display port. Other people have reported the same issue on large format 4k monitors using display port. The black screen problem is not unique to this monitor. Others have had the same problem with the 43 inch 4k LG monitor also. The solution is to switch over to HDMI because the problem is not present with HDMI. It may be a firmware problem with display port that causes the intermittent black screen. Had I known this I never would have returned my monitor for RMA. The replacement they sent at first had a large group of dead pixels. Acer agreed to replace that monitor and covered shipping. I am waiting to receive my final replacement.  Acer has done everything possible to address my needs..,Other Thoughts:Dianne with Acer corporate customer support has been very helpful in making sure my RMA was addressed properly. I have no complaints regarding the customer service and would buy an Acer product again. Dianne would email as well as call to update me on the status of my RMA.,2,1

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,"Review regarding Black Screen Issue May not be monitor issue, please read. Looking for help.",2018-12-28,Pros:Black screen problem may not be caused by the ET430k monitor,Cons:This review is regarding the black screen issue that others are writing about that I am also having on a 10 year old Samsung LN40A630 tv.  I do not own the ET430k  monitor.,"Other Thoughts:Greetings, I came to these reviews because the monitor is on sale via email deals. I eventually want to replace my 10 year old Samsung LN40A630 but am waiting for a 43"" oled tv or an LED tv or monitor that has good off axis viewing because my wife uses my monitor as a TV when she gets ready for work in the morning and most of the new 4K LED tv's have poor off axis viewing.  This old 1080P tv has surprisingly good off axis viewing.  Well, to the point, in the past month or 2 I have been experiencing the same black screen where the screen goes black and then comes back on again.  It is completely random and can happen as few as one or 2 times or as many as 6 to 12 before it stops blacking out.  This morning it got into a fit of about 8 blackouts and I was not doing anything except email and MS Edge. I am experiencing this on an HP Z420 workstation running windows 10 pro with an AMD R9 380 card that uses 2 6 pin pcie power cables.  I read comments about how someone resolved this issue by replacing one of the power supply 6 pin cables with a 6 pin adapter powered by sata or molex.  This did not help so I moved the card to the second PCIE X16 slot on the board and thought this had solved the problem as I have not noticed the problem in a week or 2 until this morning!  So I am beginning to believe that The problem is the video card, power supply or conflict between AMD and Windows 10.  Can any folks reading this who are having this problem, respond to this or post a similar review and indicate if you are running windows 10 with AMD cards and what type of Motherboard? Perhaps we can find a pattern here to finally help all having this problem and potentially eliminate the monitor as a suspect.  Additionally I have a Windows 7 pro dell T3600 with AMD rx 580 card that is not experiencing this problem using the same Samsung LN 40A630 tv. Just blanked out twice while typing the previous sentence.  :-O Thanks, Bob",1,5
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,2,"Black Screen Issues - Downgrade to 2 Eggs. I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed yet disappointed.",2018-12-19,"Pros:- Big.  As others have posted, you don't really understand how large it is unless you have previously hooked your PC up to a 40+ inch TV.  I have done this in the past, and outside of the fact that response times for gaming was kind of laggy and I had a lot slower Graphics card back then, the size I had expected, I had just forgotten how big.- The Detail. Its 4k and a glorious 4k it is. I am using a GTX 970 and as soon as prices come down on graphics cards I will be upgrading. I went from Ultra settings in BF4 to Medium/low settings. The resolution is great, but I had to lower resolution back to 1080p in games.- Colors are very vibrant and there are many options.  I had expected a remote control with this due to many reviews on Youtube referencing this monitor but showing reviews for the LG version of this monitor.","Cons:- As others have pointed out, there is some ghosting when displaying bright white for a while and then going to a grey screen, but honestly for anyone who owns any recent OLED screen on a cellphone, THEY ALL HAVE THIS PROBLEM. It is not permanent and it is not distracting. Believe me, you will get over it.-  As I pointed out earlier, I thought this came with a remote. The buttons and input settings are fine, but I like to use the gaming reticle and i have to reach around the back to turn it on whenever I game in FPS games.- The back is beautiful but the inputs are sparse. Two HDMI, one mini DP and one DP. It suffices for me, but if you are looking for hooking up 3 or more devices, you should look at the LG version of this monitor.- Scaling. I love being able to look at larger windows. My eyesight is not what it once was, so with this monitor I don't have to wear my computer glasses. That being said the scaling makes large borders around webpages and media players and the real estate of a web page is not filled such. It isn't the fault of this monitor, it is just the nature of large format monitors and internet coding.","Other Thoughts:Edit: I am updating my review after 9 months. While the Monitor continues to look as vibrant as the day I bought it, I am experiencing black screen issues when the monitor will blank out for about a second. It happens randomly. I am afraid that in about 3 months I will be out of warranty.... then what?  Its a shame that such a thing happens to an otherwise outstanding monitor.",3,0

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,1,Beautiful monitor with connection issues,2018-11-30,"Pros:Beautifully bright and high resolution, makes things look fantastic when it works.","Cons:Has an intermittent flickering issue that shows itself at random, (worse when playing a full-screen game) where the monitor will appear to disconnect from the PC, and reconnect 2-3 seconds later.  This issue cannot be repaired by using a new displayport cable, and only temporary relief can be found by switching the monitor from displayport mode 1.1->1.2.  If you attempt to get it fixed by Acer they will refuse to provide shipping for the 300$ shipping cost to get it repaired in Texas.","Other Thoughts:Buy one if you feel like playing Russian roulette on build quality, I won't be buying another Acer product again.",4,0

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,Giant Monitor of Doom,2018-10-18,"Pros:- It makes the Washington Monument look like a lawn gnome. People who walk into your office will always comment on the size. ALWAYS.- It's so bright I thought the sun was going nova when I booted into Windows.- Sturdy. It overhangs my desk and I keep bumping into it because I'm an idiot, and I haven't broken it yet.","Cons:- It's still just a 60hz monitor, but it's like $450. What did you expect, mang? Angels singing a chorus and Alyssa Milano in a bikini?- You have to have tiny hands to get the freaking power cord in the socket. When I get excited, I put the blood bank on emergency alert. So needless to say, I don't have small hands. The wife helped, though.","Other Thoughts:So this monitor is sharp, came with no dead pixels I could find, it's very bright, and the construction is solid and sturdy. It's stylish too, though the white plastic will be your enemy if you're a ridiculous slob (don't ask me how I know this). If you need a gigantic 4k monitor for work - or just want some screen size bragging rights on HardOCP - by all means, buy this. If you're one of those crazy gamers who must brag about 3097207 fps in some game, though, this monitor is not for you. Buy a 144hz monitor instead. Good luck finding a large 4k screen at this price point with a refresh rate that high, though. I don't know if they even make one. If they do, you'll have to donate a nut for scientific research in order to pay for it, though. This is $450. Seriously. The value is obvious. Best deal out there - at least when I was looking.It's a matter of priorities. What is more important to you? Speed or size? You know the right answer to that, my man.",6,4
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,Great 43 inch 4k IPS monitor for the price,2018-10-18,"Pros:Great monitor for the price, bought it during a Newegg shellshocker deal for $359.Image retention can be reduced greatly if the brightness is adjusted correctly.Have not seen any black screen issues reported by others. I run a Nvidia video card under Linux.Honestly, 43"" is really too big to be a desk monitor, but this monitor is excellent for CAD work or reducing eye strain when concentrating on fine detailed work.","Cons:The 100x200 VESA mounting is small for most TV mounts, this monitor was designed for regular desk monitor mounts. The back of the monitor is not flat and only has 2"" of clearance below the bottom two screw mounts and the top of the wider bottom portion of the monitor case. I ended up cutting off the bottom of the TV mounting plate that came with my wall mount to make it fit with the monitor.Wish it came with a DVI input or a DVI output to HDMI input cable or adapter.","Other Thoughts:For wall mounting options, I wish the monitor back was flat and the mounting screws set at a larger size like 400x400 to fit with most TV wall mounts.",0,1
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,2,"Great monitor, but black screen issue is real",2018-10-16,"Pros:The monitor itself looks great. It freed up a lot of desk space since I have it all the way back on my desk. I haven't experienced the image retention issues that others have talked about, but haven't gone looking for it either.","Cons:I also experience the black screen issue, where every now and then it blacks out for a couple seconds.

Black screen periodically can be annoying!!! - 1 star for this.  If problem is able to be fixed it would be 5 stars all the way!!!!  Manufacturer responds to everybody but me.  Guess my money didn't count!!!,Other Thoughts:I've been having the black screen issue also and thought maybe it was the GPU but was using on 1080ti and now have the 2080ti and have the same black screen every so often.  I saw others having the same problem and that the vendor has responded to them to have a solution.  I've had the unit for a year in November so have 2 years + on the warranty.

Now its too late and the problem has only gotten worse.- The screen burn in is real, but it isn't terrible. Temporary so it isn't a big deal.","Other Thoughts:I wish I could return it.

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,Fantastic for business and non-FPS gaming,2018-05-29,Pros:- Great price- Beautiful screen/color- Two DP IN one OUT (needed to run @ 60Hz on my systems)- Two HDMI (Frontier Cable STB works great!)- Stand allows my laptop/docking station to slide back/underneath neatly- Gaming on strategy sims is gorgeous!- Works great with video editing my 4K footage.,"Cons:- Retention issue, yet very minor, and unnoticeable for me unless I look for it (very, very faint = non-issue for me)- As another user mentioned, the screen will go dark once, for about a second, then come back.","Other Thoughts:This is a great, all around monitor for the money.  Was my second Acer monitor purchase, having bought my first Ultra Wide IPS from them in the past and was very pleased.  These two Acer monitors make up my ""Work Station"", as I work from home and my Dell Laptop has a Mini-DP port.  This is also my second monitor on my Gaming System (i7 w/GTX 1080 Ti), allowing me to play Civ or Railway Empire in 4K with no issues, and it is beautiful!  60Hz isn't really good with FPS games like PUBG, but when I need to do editing/playback with 4K footage, I couldn't be happier.  I don't see any issues at all in playing movies via Plex, VLC, or when connected via HDMI to a Frontier STB box like others complain of.   Plainly put, this was one of my best decisions in a monitor purchase, especially when it's on sale on the Egg!",1,0

Some games and media viewers do do HDR and looks great.3M (10ft) HBR3 DP cable (handles DP1.4) works well.","Cons:Ports not well identified as I first plugged it in the output DP port.  Had to check manual for correct port (2nd from left).Buttons not well identified on back.Monitor does not identify 10 bit to video card (Sapphire Radeon Nitro+ 580 8GB).  It sets to 8 bit panel.  I will attempt to reset it to 10 bit once the original LG 27"" 1080p DP monitor is disconnected.In Widows HDR mode, it turns brightness down quite a bit but, it is still very sharp and not as bad on the eyes for long term viewing.Blue power LED can't be seen at daylight levels.  Only when it is dark do you see reflection off the table its on.Supplied cables are too short given this monitor's massive size.  A 43"" monitor needs 10' or 3M cables to connect to PC.No Freesync modes.  Most video cards are not fast enough to keep 4K output at 60Hz frame rates at typical settings.  Going DX12 multiGPU is practically a must and not all video games support it.Update:Using a 3M HBR3 DP 1.4 cable gets a 21.6Gb/s BW, yet fails to allow 10 bit per color mode as screen goes blank.  Appears to be a 8 bit panel with FRC to get 10 bit at FHD.  This should have been in the specifications section.  Alternatively, have the internal CPU take 10 and 12 bpc from DP port at 4K and display 8 bpc + 2 FRC with brief warning displayed (2-5 seconds) instead of no picture.  This could be done in firmware.  If it is a 10 bit panel, the firmware is bad.Going to Freesync 2 would do HDR better.  It does force 10 bit per color and can do 16 bpc on OLED panels.A remote would be nice which would remove cons for buttons being on the back.","Other Thoughts:Anti-alaising is not needed when using this monitor as people with 20/20 vision won't see individual pixels at distances greater than 28"".  No one I know games at anywhere near that close on a monitor this big.  I game at 36"" on a 28"" 4K 60hz TN panel on my old system.  I need longer cables to move this monitor to 48"" away from my eyes.

Colors, especially fire, are gorgeous. Only other game I've played is Ori and the Blind Forest, superb.Text is so crisp. Running at 200% scaling. Some programs don't scale well, like the Steam client. You can turn off scaling (for any individual program, at that) but then its tiny. /shrug.For video, coming from 1080p is noticeable. Netflix UHD(via Roku Ultra), labeled as such, looks great; some stuff is labeled HDR (1080p, I assume, Jessica Jones Season 1,for example), which can go from great time blocky, depending on source (i.e. grainy).

This monitor is built to have retention problem, no panel luck or unluck involved here.

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,3,Good monitor but has DisplayPort issues,2017-12-31,Pros:The monitor is huge. It has great color and the contrast is good for an IPS monitor. The speakers are decent. It runs good using HDMI. The monitor has excellent features for the price. HDR and the bluelight technology are nice.,Cons:If the monitor is hooked to DisplayPort the screen will occasionally go black for a few seconds but the power stays on. I have tried the monitor with a 960 GTX and a 1070 GTX. I have tried two other DisplayPort cables. I have another Acer Ultra HD monitor which doesn't have this issue with these video cards using DisplayPort.,Other Thoughts:The monitor is nice but the monitor going black on DisplayPort is disconcerting.  I took two stars off because of this issue. I'm considering sending it back because clearly something is wrong with this monitor.,9,1

It is especially visible if to switch to grey area or when PC is shutting down.,"Other Thoughts:I would recommend to mount it to a wall. If you place it on your desk, your position will not be ergonomic and will result in issues with your neck and following headache. It is better to mount this in such a way that your eyes will look straight to the upper 1/4 of this monitor.  The suitable VESA mount is 200x100 mm. Remember that mount 200x200mm or bigger will not fit.The distance between your eyes and this monitor does not matter, you can keep any distance which is comfortable for you.Use a powerful video card (at least 1070 GTX) if you are going to play games because it is real 4k.",1,1

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,3,Image Retention Galore,2017-12-02,Pros:Its big & cheap for the price.,"Cons:Image Retention: Good if you wish to waste your time gaming or on movies. Bad if you wish to get any real work done on this type of monitor. 4k can break a monitor into 4 1080p partitions that can be used for work.  Simultaneous viewing of information increases productivity. Furthermore, high level OS-es and their programs are terrible at scaling up/down so this monitor is finally a monitor that is large enough that it can display 4K with no scaling and still have enough size to make text readable and not fuzzy. Unfortunately, this monitor most certainly suffers from image retention. Its most obvious with a gray background which... coincidentally much coding is done against if using a dark scheme or DOS prompt. Its gets quite obnoxious and seems like 2 unfortunate steps back for companies like ACER to pump out monitor technology with such an obvious defect. I've tried turning the monitor brightness way down and all settings and possible variations of cabling...ect but of course that doesn't change the underlying science of why the image retention is there. I'm not going to return the monitor but the image retention is most certainly going to urk me for the next 5+ years of my life assuming the monitor hopefully lasts that long. I would have bought another monitor but for whatever reason companies seem to gloss over and hope people won't get upset about image retention. I have a samsung 23"" that has served me faithfully for 15 years and it is still fully functional and has no image retention issues to speak of. The new direction monitor companies are going for with appearance above lifetime and functionality is certainly getting frustrating. ACER don't pump out monitors that suffer from image retention in a matter of minutes.",,9,4

Super bright, super sharp, nice construction, very thin and flat.  Everything I wanted at an INCREDIBLE price compared to what else is on the market right now.  Acer was never on my list of ""go to"" brands before.  But now they are definitely on my radar.",Cons:My ONLY complaint is there was at least one dead pixel.  But i guess out of 8.2 million... you'll have this occasionally.,Other Thoughts:I would buy a second one if i had the spare cash.,1,2
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,"You get what you pay for, maybe more...",2017-12-01,"Pros:It is very large and I like having lots of desktop space, which it gives.It has speakers that don't seem to sound too bad, but I don't plan on using them.I like the stand though it isn't adjustable. (That I know of.) It is a nice change from the standard LCD monitor stand that is the platform type plane thingy.Came with connection cables, both HDMI and DP.","Cons:Image retention is real. It may not come out as prominent if you do not have the brightness maxed. It probably doesn't really matter too much.The edges of the screen appear to be a bit brighter than the rest of the screen. A halo of sorts. But again, it probably doesn't really matter.Cables that come with it could be longer.","Other Thoughts:As of doing this review I have just gotten it and these are my initial findings. This gets 5 eggs because the value you get for the price you pay just seems amazing.I would not say this is a gaming monitor. I did not buy this for gaming. The average gamer should probably go with a 1080p TN monitor with a 1ms response time. You can probably find one for around $100. It's not going to be a huge monitor like this one, but it will likely allow for higher quality gaming experience for the hardware you likely have.If you like having lots of space, this seems to be a pretty good monitor, I just wouldn't call it a gaming monitor as most people that would put a game on this monitor would have to sacrifice quality for screen resolution in order to have a decent frame rate.",1,2

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,5,One Of A Kind,2017-11-23,"Pros:I'm currently using this monitor connected to a laptop which has a GTX graphics card HDMI out port. It can only do 4k @ 30hz, rather than the smoother 60hz. To get 60hz I have to go down on the resolution. It's not that big of a deal because I'm going to build a desktop for this anyway. With all of that being said, this is a great deal. ACER is to be commended for helping to push the concept of big monitors down to us mere mortals who don't poop gold bricks.Initially there is a learning curve with this monitor because it's so big. But the great benefit of this monitor is it's adaptability. You can use it to watch full movies and it's exactly like a TV. Then, do you need to work on spreadsheets and websites? No problem. You can comfortably view 4 programs all at once and multi-task like a champ. Some people have complained about retention issue but I disabled overdrive and have not noticed any such thing.I have an odd situation in that I work out of a recliner and a low-height mobile desk that I have to pull over my legs and type. It's incredibly comfortable but my height and position is different from everyone else on earth when working at a computer. It has been challenging for me being so close, but that's no fault of the monitor. You really need to consider how much depth you can get between yourself and this thing. You really have to turn your head, up, down, left and right because it's so big. It's not awful because of that, it's just new. We're not used to doing it.But I still highly recommend this monitor because it's a one of a kind experience that is almost impossible to find in this price range. It frees you from needing multiple monitors, can multitask like a champ and use the monitor as a TV and display things to people who come into your office. Not to mention gaming, which I've not gotten to yet, but you will need a BEAST video card. I did not buy it for gaming.","Cons:Stand is nothing special. Could be better, because monitor does teeter a bit.Speakers are flat, but it's always nice to have that available for space-saving situations.It's huge. I hate to say this a con, but it can be. The box it came in was GIGANTIC and you seriously have to consider how far back you'll sit.","Other Thoughts:I don't know.

Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,3,A decent monitor.,2017-08-07,"Pros:Better than average color, and dynamic range.Blue light option is a plus.Turns on and off with the computer.","Cons:If you run the monitor to highest brightnes you will see burn in images. Not a problem if you calibrate it as it is way too bright by default.Ghosting if you use the extreme game mode, but if you turn it off it is no longer a problem and looks like normal motion blur.No remote.Calibration reports less than 100% sRGB for some reason? (92% with Spyder 5 pro)No audio options and sound is not very good, consider external speakers or sound bar.Super Sharp while increasing clarity lowers latency. You should leave it off at all times when viewing motion like video or gaming.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend it for the price . When calibrated the colors are pretty accurate, and most of the problems that people experience like ghosting, and burn in .disappear.Watching Youtube 4k HDR content is pretty amazing in HDR mode. That's probably the only time you should use HDR mode.When calibrated brightness should be around 7-10, contrast around 50, black level 0. Every other feature should be turned off.Edit video in Rec709Edit Images in sRGBWatch normal HD movies in Movie mode with 30 Brightness,  and Blue Light color Temp. Make sure to turn off game mode, and super sharp or you won't get the natural film motion blur that movies are designed for.Watch 4k HDR content in HDR mode. You can leave brightness at full here for HDR content, but again make sure to turn off game mode and super sharp to get natural film motion blur. These features are not designed for watching film content.Reduce eye strain in ECO mode with Blue Light at 50I highly recommend you do not watch the monitor in max brightness  HDR mode for long periods of time it will affect your eyes and sleep patterns. It is way too bright and has too much blue light for your brain and eyes to function normally. There is a reason this monitor comes with the Blue-Light option, use it at night.",27,2
Acer,UM.ME0AA.001,4,Happy Customer,2017-07-12,"Pros:Pros:- It’s big, like having two monitors side by side.- Colors are correct. I didn’t have to adjust them.- No problems with picture or screen, just larger than other monitors.- 5ms- Acer product.","Cons:Cons:- Screen controls are a bit hard to figure out, but once you learn them it’s okay.- Stand is a bit wobbly, but I can fix that if it gets to be a problem.- (Here is a big Con.) I had to buy a new display card to run my games. My MSI GTX960 was just not giving me a high fps at the 4K monitor setting. To get 60Hz you have to have HDMI 2.0 port, or Displayport 1.2 or 1.3 port with your display card. If you don’t have one of these ports, you will only get 30Hz.- I had to set my Windows 7 Display Control to 150% for fonts because the 4K screen makes icons and text too small and hard to read.","Other Thoughts:And the final word. Yes, if this monitor burns up, I will buy another one. It is large enough to really enjoy games or open multi windows. I’ve noticed LG and other companies are selling the same 43 inch.

It is also weighs considerably less than the one it replaced.,Cons:If you use the supplied stand the monitor wobbles a bet when touched.   Mine is attached to a 3M MS110 stand so that is not an issue but I did have to add a 0.75 inch spacer to the VESA mount to have enough clearance for the cord on the DVI connector.,,1,0

Due to this problem this unit is not for a user that tends to be less than gentle with their components. I feel that the lack of quality in reference to the stand should cost the rating to reflect three eggs.,"Other Thoughts:I did not purchase this monitor from Newegg as I had a rather generous gift card for another vendor.

Text is fuzzy, the brightness and color varies across the screen, the viewing angle is tiny, etc. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it's quite cheap (around $100) and it displays text, which is about all I need it for. I use it as a second monitor in addition to my desktop, so I don't really need it to do a lot. And it's a good thing. If you need this as a primary monitor, don't buy it! You will be sorry.

You have to be careful when adjusting the positioning once mounted because the plastic mounting system on the back of the monitor may pop loose.

I'm sure the design allows for better cooling (I am not a mechanical engineer though).","Other Thoughts:We have purchased I believe over 200 of these units so far from here and other sources. These are meant for businesses with longer than a work day of viewing time at a time which should be considered when looking at business systems.

Love the built-in USB3 hub that give ports on the back and side.","Cons:None, really.","Other Thoughts:You don't really realize just how big a 34"" Ultra-Wide monitor is until you put it on your desk. The viewing area on this monitor is nearly 3-feet across. I was initially worried about it being 1080P resolution at a 34"" size, however when you sit back far enough to actually see the whole monitor, it's definitely the right resolution. The monitor is about the same height as 24"" widescreen monitor, so the pixel density is just right.",1,1

Dell,SE2417HG,4,Good monitor.  Bad NVIDIA Control Panel settings.,2017-07-02,Pros:Reasonable price.  Sturdy stand.  Good picture.,Cons:No DVI port but I knew that when I bought it.,"Other Thoughts:I'm writing this review to help others.  This is a decent.  However when I first plugged it in I was appalled at the lack of blacks and how washed out the screen looked.  It looked awful next to my 3 year old monitor.  Luckily I read Alex's review about fixing the black levels in the NVIDIA control panel but he didn't say how to do it.  I figured it out and now I'm happy with the monitor.  Then I checked my other desktop and learned that it also was wrong in the NVIDIA control panel.  So if you have a NVIDIA video card this is what you need to know.  HDMI is a standard for HDTVs where DVI and Display port were designed for computer monitors.  So when NVIDIA configures a device hooked to an HDMI port it assumes that it's a HDTV and sends it a limited range of colors.  This causes poor blacks, bad contrast, and a washed out appearance.  To fix it go into the control panel and under 3. Apply the following settings choose Use NVIDDIA color settings.  Then in the bottom right corner change Output dynamic range: from limited to full.  Click apply at the bottom and then using the monitors power button cycle power to the monitor.  This will fix the problem.  Remember this applies to any monitor hooked to the HDMI port of a NVIDIA video car.",18,2
Dell,SE2417HG,5,"EDITED: After some tricky tweaks, became a very solid monitor. Audio passthrough is amazing!!",2017-04-22,"Pros:- 24"" was a welcome upgrade from 21""- 3.5mm jack to pass-through HDMI audio eliminates the need for a separate audio device to split signals. You don't know how useful this is until you have it!!- Low lag mode is useful. I don't experience the ghosting that others have mentioned.- Easy UI- Pretty bright. Watch your eyes!","Cons:- [SOLVED] Bad blacks, bad contrast. Windows Color Cal didn't work either. Pretty washy.- Backlight visibly fades from edges of screen, very obvious when screen is black!- Sometimes the HDMI auto-detect trips up a little and you have to remind it what you're sending.","Other Thoughts:*This is my edited review. My main initial complaint was the lack of darks and color gamut.[EDIT] It turns out that it was my Nvidia settings on my PC that was causing my blacks to be not-so-black. My graphics card naturally does not send the full color range when outputting HDMI, so I had to manually change that setting in my Nvidia control panel. After that, the blacks were SO MUCH better. It still wasn't perfect, mind you, but it was an extremely welcome difference between the limited range that it was initially sending.I should also note the utility of the 3.5mm (headphone) passthrough jack on the bottom of the monitor. For systems that send audio only through HDMI (looking at you, WiiU), you'd need a separate device to extract the audio from it if you need it to go to a different source. With the passthrough, you don't need that - just plug headphones or your speaker system in there, and you're good to go!This would be the perfect monitor for fighting games a la Super Smash Bros. and the like. Negligible lag, audio passthrough for headphone/speaker users...it's got the whole e-sports package.",12,0

(They are greyed out)","Other Thoughts:I am writing my review here because Dell keeps on deleting mine from their website (I wonder why).  I bought this monitor straight from them and I returned it the next day.  The monitor looks nice our of the box.  It's got a nice bright screen, clear images but all that cannot benefit from a screen that has very poor ghosting.  This monitor is not a 2ms screen as advertised but more of a 5ms.  You have to go into the OSD setting and set it to ""fast"" mode to get the 2ms.  That is where the fun begins.  Ghosting makes this monitor not worth 50 bucks.  On ""normal"" setting its fine but I wanted it for the fast response time so on 2ms it hardly legible.  I played with every setting I could and reset the monitor more times I can think of.  Its not worth the price.  Put it this way, on Dell's website they list it as a ""top seller"" but with no reviews?  You would think there would be at least a couple.  There are far better options out there in a similar price point.  In 2016 the cheapest of cheapest monitor should not be ghosting.  Spend your money with a better company.",20,10
Dell,SE2417HG,5,Great Monitor for the Price,2016-08-11,"Pros:I purchased this monitor to replace an old one and it has been absolutely fantastic. The response time is amazing and the clarity is superb. I love having the dual monitor HDMI in ports and have my PC and XBOX One hooked up so I can switch between the two with ease. I highly recommend this monitor if you are looking for a well priced gaming monitor, with a fantastic 1-2ms response time, and do not want to shell out the cash for a 2k or 4k monitor.Also, I like the 3.5mm headset jack on the monitor, for HDMI audio pass-through, as it makes it much easier to hook up my wired headset instead of running the cable down to my PC which would always get caught on something as it wasn't that long.","Cons:The only side of this that I would consider to be not 100% to the description, is that there are not any true blacks that I can see. It was not a big deal for me as it gets very close and you won't notice it after a day of use anyways.",Other Thoughts:Not sure what other reviews are being negative about no VESA mounting....it never said it in the description so I would make sure you read all of the features before purchasing.,4,2

I tried to back it out a couple times, but it would never go in right, and broke.Monitor enters sleep mode pretty fast after it detects no input.I was playing between my XBOX (HDMI) and PC (DP) and had to power off the monitor completely to wake it back up.I looked for a firmware update, as mine was at 1.3.  I can find nowhere on the web to find firmware updates, so I don't know if there are further updates.  There's no USB port....so that's kind of concerning.I still have no idea what Ultra Vivid and Overdrive is.  The manual explains it in no way.It's not Freesync 2, which is what the XBOX claims to support.  Regardless, I was able to turn it on.It won't matter for locked 30 FPS games, since Freesync 1 is 48 on the low end.In the days of 50"" TCL 4k Roku HDR TVs for cheaper....just wondering why there's no HDR in this one.Monitor has tilt adjustment, but no height adjustment.  You'll have to use the included VESA mount to buy your own stand for that purpose.","Other Thoughts:I have a detached garage that has an apartment above it.  There I already have a 4k TV.I bought it so I could have Halo MCC LAN parties (with my second XBOX ONE X), and I valued the high refresh rate over the 4K.This because I'll retire my 4770k/GTX1080 rig up there to go with it, which can take advantage of the 144hz/Freesync compatibility and should be good for 1440p gaming for some time to come.",0,0
Pixio,PX329,5,realy loving this monitor after 3 weeks!,2019-03-18,"Pros:fast response time ,great color and brightness, light for its size great for gaming ,andyou really get immersed in the game! almost like 3d.",Cons:costs a lot of $ but worth every penny!,"Other Thoughts:had this monitor about a month and im really enjoying it. it was a little hard to get used to as I went from a 24 inch 1080p to this monster!i had to scale windows a bit to read a little better but no biggie. its brighter than some are talking about and no dead or stuck pixels! lucky! if you are a person who sits very close you may want a smaller size or just wait some time to get used to this one. the colors are great especial when watching  videos or playing games. also you really  get immersed into your games almost kinda 3d like. out of the box you have to fiddle with the settings to get it the way you like it, but I knew that before buying.the stand is verry strong and ok but im going to eventually vesa mount this because my desk is a little small and the legs kind of hang off the edge, but its not a bad thing if you have a larger computer desk.i read a lot of different reviews saying good and bad things about this monitor and thus far ive seen only the  good things. I know its not one of the major name brands but its just as good if not better. the manufacturer website sells thier own vesa stands but only for other models. for some reason this monitor is not compatable with the ones they sell weird? .over all a great monitor and i recomend it! so go buy it!",1,0
Pixio,PX329,4,Great First Impression!,2019-03-14,"Pros:Great size! Sharp Image! Solid colors! Smooth as silk at higher refresh rates! This was a pretty significant upgrade for my visuals, in that I was running 3x24"" 60hz 1080p monitors before. Once I got this new one set up at 165hz, the difference was IMMEDIATELY visible. For those interested in the Gaming ramifications, going from 60FPS in WoW at 60hz to 165hz was resulted in a much smoother experience, even before I changed the Nvidia settings to allow for >60hz rates. I didn't notice much change going from the locked 60FPS to 100+FPS, but that refresh rate is definitely icing on the cake of a larger, 2k screen. *thumbs up*","Cons:With the qualification that I've only had this monitor a couple of days, I can't level much in the way of complaints.My sole complaint is the reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating... and it's significant. One of the 4 VESA mounting holes was not properly threaded. I couldn't get a mounting screw into that hole, no matter what I tried. Frankly, I'm not concerned about it enough to RMA it at this point. If, however, there are any additional issues that corp up, I'll definitely be sending it back. Everything else about this unit is pretty spot on. I think the quality is solid for the price-point. I'm willing to believe that this minor manufacturing issue is a fluke... if a disappointing one.","Other Thoughts:The Joystick that is used for the OSD controls would be MUCH more useful if it was under the bottom right corner of the monitor (your right, as you face it). My situation isn't typical, in that I have portrait-oriented 24"" monitors flanking this 32 for productivity, but even if they weren't there, reaching forward and under the bottom edge would be more accessible for most, rather than having to reach around the side edge... given this is a 32"" diagonal.While 32"" is pretty massive on a desk, my desk is roughly 48"" x 36"", with my monitors mounted on a triple monitor stand affixed to the back edge, and I find that it is pretty much perfect for my taste at that viewing distance.",1,0
Pixio,PX329,5,Great Monitor,2019-03-08,"Pros:The price to performance of this monitor is a great value. I bought this on sale, and I am glad I did, no dead pixels. Freesync with Nvidia with the latest drivers works. Just make sure you plug in the proper port, turn on Freesync in the on screen menu, the Gsync option will show up in you Geforce Experience window. FreeSync refresh rate is only 48-144hz.","Cons:Had to download the manual online to figure out how to mount the VESA mount, wish they would add this in the manual they sent with the product.Stand only has a tilt option. I guess this is what VESA is for",Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend any time you can get this monitor for less than $360. Go look at all the youtube reviews if you have any doubts about this monitor.,1,0
Pixio,PX329,3,Great for PC but....,2019-02-11,Pros:Great picture easy to calibrate to best viewing specsAllot of features for your dollarAllows 144hz with PC however.....,Cons:Is not compatible with 120hz on Xbox one x,,0,7
Pixio,PX329,5,excellent bang for the buck,2019-01-23,"Pros:bought 3 of these and not a single dead pixel.  screen is large, blacks are very black, colors are very good, and it doesn't seem washed out at all.  great price.",Cons:none,Other Thoughts:would definitely purchase again if I had a need,4,0

Pixio,PX329,2,response time...,2018-12-26,"Pros:I really like the color, size, and resolution. every game looks better than ever before. It makes games really beautiful, as long as you are not moving.","Cons:I cant play fps games on this, unless I have v-sync on. I tried messing with OD and there is ghosting/input lag with or without it. my old Acer monitor is preferable with its 1 ms response time","Other Thoughts:Id recommend it if you are not doing fast paced games, Overwatch especially dies on this monitor. if there are any setting tweaks i could do let me know please.",4,8
Pixio,PX329,4,"It's a good value, but definitely not high end.",2018-12-19,"Pros:Color is good so long as you don't over saturate.  Picture quality is OK, nice and bright.  Being ""only"" 2560x1440 and blown up to 32"", image sharpness and text quality is a little bit blurrier than my 27"" ASUS PB Series PB278Q, but I guess that was to be expected. The PB278Q is still my preference for productivity and work when I'm not gaming or watching movies. Refresh rate is much higher than any other monitor I own. Very noticable to me when watching movies or running a game. Of course, FreeSync is great. The controls are convenient once you get used to using the toggle instead of old school navigational buttons.","Cons:I don't like the base. Yes, it's nice and sturdy, but if you're going with a fixed or semi-fixed base, I'd much prefer if they went with a simple flat plate instead of the protruding legs. At least with a flat plate, I can reclaim some of the desk space and slide my keyboard under it when not in use. As it stands now, you really can't stack much under the monitor. Whatever space savings you're getting from the really slim screen are completely lost due to those long protruding legs. Pixio should consider using a flat base for future models. I doubt it's that much more from a cost perspective. Also, not having built-in speakers is not a big deal since this is a gaming monitor, but it would have been nice to have.  When I'm just watching YouTube or whatever, I don't like to put on the headphones or turn on the  big booming external speakers.","Other Thoughts:Purchased this monitor from Newegg through their ""alternate"" online store which cannot be named here. Got it primarily because I wanted a FreeSync capable monitor to compliment the MSI Radeon RX Vega 64 I just bought.  For the price, this is a good deal ($350+) for a gaming monitor of this size and feature set.  I would however, not recommend it if if you're looking for a monitor for productivity.",2,1
Pixio,PX329,5,,2018-12-10,"Pros:Looks great works great...  great customer service mine was missing a power supply when it showed up, and I got in touch with Newegg who then got me in touch with pixio, and someone answered the phone on the second ring!! No robot or push this button to get to the next button!!!",Cons:None yet,"Other Thoughts:Well with customer service like this you shouldn’t have to worry about to many problems, also I had to go get me an Nvidia RTX 2080 to really see how well this monitor preforms",2,0
Pixio,PX329,4,Great Gaming Monitor (first impression),2018-12-07,Pros:- Solid build quality- Large display- Not Curved- Certainly a sizable bump in picture quality vs my aging tn panel and also my cheaper ips panel.- High refresh 165Hz- No dead/stuck pixels- Perfectly simple aesthetic design- Sturdy stand (albeit featureless),"Cons:- DP Cable is very short, something like 4-5ft- Has a power brick...That's all i can find to complain about.  I wouldn't consider myself qualified to make statements about color accuracy and such.","Other Thoughts:- I have an RTX 2070 and it's pretty difficult to reach consistent 144-165fps in most non esports titles.- I would say the pixel density is very similar to my 24"" 1080p display which is perfectly fine in my opinion.- A 32"" Display is bordering on verge of being too big depending on the types games you play,  the edges are far enough away to be outside of your focused view.- 144-165Hz vs 60-75Hz To my eyes there's an obvious increase in clarity of moving objects though I'm not sure it really lives up to the hype.- Kudos to Newegg + FedEx free standard shipping (Ordered Friday, Delivered Saturday) it's nice to live ~ 300 miles from distrocenter.Overall I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for a large monitor.",2,2
Pixio,PX329,5,"Great monitor, couldn't be happier",2018-11-30,"Pros:Large, uniform brightness, no dead pixels, native resolution is excellent for games and an autocad workstation.","Cons:No instructions on assembling the metal stand, otherwise excellent.","Other Thoughts:I highly recommend this monitor if you're a serious gamer or feel like you're needing additional real estate and higher resolution on your screen. Obviously you'll need a serious gpu to run it with high fps, so factor that in your decision making.",3,0
Pixio,PX329,5,GREAT Monitor. Buy and you will be happy ! !,2018-11-30,"Pros:VA Panel - Great balance between IPS and TNLooks great. No dead pixels, bright,","Cons:Stand is perfectly fine but it just tilts back and forth. If you want more, you'll DEFINATELY want a better stand.","Other Thoughts:I was purchasing items this year to do a new build. Since I was moving up to an i5 9600k and 1070ti, I wanted a monitor that could take advantage of that power so I started looking at 1440p monitors. At first, I was looking at an IPS monitor but those were usually about another $100 over the TN panels. I then discovered these VA monitors which is a nice balance between the IPS and TN. Right when I plugged this monitor in, I was blown away. The picture (out of the box) was AMAZING. I purchased a 4K 60Hz Samsung monitor from a store a few months ago and took it back because I didn't like the scaling. This Pixio monitor (watching 1440p) looks EVERY bit just as good as the Samsung I returned. Not only do the videos look so realistic, the 100% scaling on Windows is perfect for this monitor. It allows you to have two nice sized screens open so you can do productive stuff. I had Progression 3 guitar software open in one window while watching a tutorial video on the other window and everything looked great. I've put this monitor thru a few quick runs on Battlefield 4, Star Wars Battlefront II, etc and had NO issues with stuttering or tearing and I'm not even using an AMD card. Buy this monitor. You will NOT be disappointed.",3,0
Pixio,PX329,5,Amazing Monitor!,2018-11-21,"Pros:- 165Hz is far smoother than 60hz or 120hz. tested it so far ( Fortnite, Overwatch, BF1, PUBG and LOL)- Pretty good OSD and easy to use- Super good color reproduction, very happy with every aspect of image reproduction.",Cons:- Basic stand but it has VESA mount holes,Other Thoughts:This is my 2nd monitor from Pixio. I purchased it on AMZ. I am really happy that there is a 165Hz 32 inch flat screen option. Overall a great monitor.,4,1
Pixio,PX329,3,"Nice Features, lackluster image",2018-11-21,"Pros:- 165hz is great- Stand is actually decent even though there not much adjustment, looks and feels premium- Slim design- Flat panel, no pointless curve","Cons:The overall image quality leaves alot to be desired. The whites are more grey, though the blacks and contrasts is really solid. Im coming from a budget 4k 60hz Samsung panel which may be affecting my initial feeling of this monitor. The colors and vibrancy of that Samsung panel absolutely BLOWS this away and I believe that was a VA panel as well. I've tried messing with settings on this pixio and nothing really gets it right. Turning up the backlight/brightness just dull out the overall image. Im sure I will get used to the less than stellar brightness as I continue to use it, but it is kind of disappointing.","Other Thoughts:Was going to sell the 4k Samsung but may end up keeping just for games where I prefer better image over smoother gameplay. I would recommend this if youre more of a multiplayer person as the 144/165hz is a huge difference and this monitor will be fine.  But If youre more into single player and pretty looking games, I would go with a different monitor.",4,5
Pixio,PX329,5,Great monitor!,2018-10-10,"Pros:- 1440p is the future and i am never going back.- I'm pumping up 165Hz through my nvidia card to it for all gaming needs.- 165hz in games is super smooth! The games that he play look completely different in 165hz compared to 60hz.- Super slim design with a small bezel.- Great picture, absolutely no complaints on this as it was worth every penny.",Cons:- FreeSync only,Other Thoughts:Took a chance and bought this new PX329. This monitor is outstanding for gaming and everyday use!! 165hz refresh rate is worth every penny. The resolution is always at its best. I will definitely will recommend this monitor to a friend.,11,0
Pixio,PX329,3,Misleading,2018-08-18,Pros:affordable,Cons:NOT an IPS display.

Have to be straight on with this monitor and picture quality is still weak. The select able defaults provide a little difference in picture.,"Other Thoughts:I have an Acer s230hl that I have had for at least 4years and is still working great. Very good picture quality for the price. I would recommend that monitor instead of this one for a budget monitor. think its selling for 95 bucks atm.  Wish I would of read the other reviews before this purchase, I definitely would have purchased the Acer s230hl as a second screen.

Acer,UM.WX3AA.004,1,"Terrible Product. Color quality is atrocious, controls and drivers are bad too.",2017-12-06,Pros:- Cheap,"Cons:- Doesn't do true black. The screen always looks like some blue or white backlighting is preventing the screen from having good dark colors.- The drivers are outdated and unsigned making acquiring and installing them difficult (and they don't fix anything).- The color controls do nothing. I've tried changing all of the settings, via the monitor buttons, the computer display settings, and the NVIDIA video settings. They have little to no impact on the picture quality.","Other Thoughts:I would not recommend this product to anyone. However I have been using an ACER X203H for nearly 6 years now and it is still a magnificent monitor, so maybe the K222HQL is just a bad ACER product.",0,0

Acer,UM.WX3AA.004,3,A Just OK Monitor,2017-12-05,Pros:- At the time (Black Friday) was priced only at $70- VESA Mountable,"Cons:- Color is incredibly washed and bright, regardless of how low I turn the brightness setting- Advertised 1920 x 1080, but is visibly less clear than my other 1920 x 1080 monitor, almost like everything has a glow around it- Monitor settings offer very little options, and certainly none to aid in solving the picture problems- Reflection from the monitor on the inside of the bezel.  The reflection was so great I had initially thought there was a dead bar at the top where I couldn't move my mouse, but turned out be a reflection","Other Thoughts:Probably won't recommend this to others, but I'm definitely not returning it.  That would be way too much of an investment.  Instead I will be giving to my sister just so she can watch her Netflix in peace.

Acer,UM.WX3AA.004,2,"Don't Buy, Bad Panel Display.",2017-11-26,"Pros:Newegg's Great Price and fast shipping. Monitor has a very stable round stand (In my opinion better than the Square Stands), and the outside looks good. As with all ACERS very easy set up. VGA was the only video Cable included, but not a big deal as I have a lot of spare DVI and HDMI cables.","Cons:OK let's see, Color is washed out, (Too Bright), and I could NOT adjust the picture.. I called ACER and talked to Tech Support. Very nice Lady who walked me through the menu. The Brightness and Contrast controls make NO Difference. Picture is terrible and way too Bright. I tried all settings, Normal, Cool, Warm, etc. Tried User, Standard, Graphics settings, Eco, etc. No Change in Picture. I'm very disappointed with ACER, this is a faulty unit. Now I have to contact Newegg for an RMA and re-pack this paperweight to send it back. Don't wast your money. It's not worth it even a $69.00 +, ($80. total).","Other Thoughts:I've owned ACER Monitors for many years. My current ACER is a P235H 22"" HDMI. I've had it since 2008. I've NEVER had any problems with it. The Picture still looks great and I'm only using the DVI connection with factory settings. I also have a ACER AL 1916 12"" Monitor that only has VGA and DVI connections. It still has a great picture also. They both are great Monitors and still work. On a separate note I've seen a lot of people taking Eggs off their review for the Monitor's Speakers not being good? This is confusing to me as I've never bought a Monitor for the speakers. It's pretty obvious that these types of monitors would have low quality sound especially with Music Playback. I don't know anyone who would buy a monitor for it's Speakers unless they were taking some type of Dictation? Computer speakers are pretty cheap from Newegg and most sound pretty good for under $30.00.",1,1
Acer,UM.WX3AA.004,3,Good value but has drawbacks,2017-11-25,Pros:Decent colors. Variety of port options. Price.,Cons:Very limited viewing angle. With this monitor you will need to have your chair height adjustment so that your line of sight is very close to 90 degrees with regard to the plane of the monitor face. My other issues is that the control buttons are not labeled. Keep your owner's manual handy. Default brightness and contrast settings gave a very bleached out appearance on my Mac. Manual adjustment helped significantly.,Other Thoughts:Meets my needs for a repair station monitor in my computer repair business. It would not meet my needs for use in a primary system. The limited viewing angle is a significant negative in my opinion.,0,0

LG,25UM56-P,1,Disappointing.,2018-12-24,Pros:Good price for its size and resolution.,"Cons:Only a little more than a month after purchase, the top-left area of the monitor went black with rainbow stripes that stretch across the top of the screen. Anything placed in that area causes massive screen-wide flickering","Other Thoughts:Nice price, but needless to say, unfortunate to encounter a defect this early in its use. Not sure if we still have the original packaging, so I'm not sure if it can even be sent back at this point. Will probably look for another brand next time.",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,"Not what I pictured, but Reliable and easy to get used to.",2018-12-19,Pros:-A lot of horizontal screen real-estate.-Works well with Windows 10 and all software/games-After a year of constant use there are zero dead pixels (in both monitors) and no signs of any issues-Colors are fine for me. Seems like the colors I have set up currently tend to have darker warm tones which is something I like. I don't like excessively bright colors. I am sure this could be changed.,"Cons:-With the extension of horizontal screen real-estate comes with the lose of vertical screen real-estate. I almost returned these monitors because of this, but it is easy to get used to and is actually quite nice once I got used to it.-These monitors do not hook up using display port cables.They only have HDMI ports. Again, this was almost a deal breaker for me because my video card only has one HDMI port. Then I found cables that go from HDMI to Display Ports and this issue became a none issue. I didn't read through the specs as thoroughly as I should have.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this monitor for those looking to get a nice wide aspect ratio, primarily because I have had zero issues since I have hooked these monitors up. Since I have two I can double down on the reliability of this monitor.Another reason I went with two of this monitor was I got them during the black Friday deal of 2017.I wouldn't recommend these monitors gaming to be honest. Games work fine on them, but I play competitive fast paced games and wish I could get a higher refresh rate. This monitor can handle 70hz, but I have issues getting the refresh rate to stay put. After a restart or a shut down I have to set up the refresh rate with Nvidia control panel and the game itself and sometimes it would work and other times it would refuse. So I gave up on dealing with the refresh rate.I plan on stacking these monitors on top of each other using a vertical desk monitor mount and adding a 144hz monitor as my main monitor for gaming and other tasks.",1,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Budget Friendly but Interesting...,2018-12-03,"Pros:- Good color quality.- Ultra wide benefits (e.g. Gaming, space, etc.)- Sharp and crisp quality.- Cheap ultra wide.- VESA mount compatible.","Cons:- Smaller type of ultra wide, but it doesn't completely ruin the experience.","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these monitors yet the colors are off by the white balance. I have them sitting side by side, and it is quite noticeable. I'd be cautious if considering a double or triple monitor setup with this type of monitor.",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,3,Way too small,2018-12-01,"Pros:I made a mistake in purchasing this size and will probably return it. Ultrawide is meant to be a substitute for dual monitors, but at 25"" only gives 23"" horizontal space and 17"" vertical. I'm not sure what the point of this is, but at least it's affordable.Otherwise the quality is very good. Resolution and color quality are outstanding for the price.","Cons:- Very limited stand adjustability. Only tilts vertically, and very slightly.- Like other reviews said, it's very bright. Difficult to make it dim and still readable. This is a con for me in a dark room. Could be a pro in a bright office.","Other Thoughts:I would not recommend this unless you're a) extremely short on desk space, or b) only interested widescreen gaming on a budget.",0,0

It's not a typical AC power cable like I have seen on the majority (if not ALL) monitors I've ever dealt with the in past. It's basically a wall wart like power cable. It's not a huge problem, but I do have several long AC power cords that I like to use for monitors since they are usually a good ways from the power strip.

You will need to use 3rd party software for games to look right. Same with certain websites.,"Other Thoughts:Gave Ultra-Wide a try and overall I don't see the benefit of this over a standard screen. Given this is my personal preference and not a flaw in the product, I gave it 5 stars. If you like Ultra-Wide, then this is a good product.

LG,25UM56-P,3,Nice while it lasted,2018-03-11,"Pros:Nice screen, decent for FPS gaming","Cons:Unfortunately the button broke around 2 years and 4 months after purchase. By broke I mean that small contacts fell out of the button housing and the button just wiggled loosely. The monitor would not power off using the button. Then about 2 months later, the monitor would no longer power on. And as others mentioned, the button is just a pain to use. Poorly designed in my opinion.","Other Thoughts:The monitor button broke so it would no longer operate and then the monitor died after about 2 years and 5 months of ownership. I liked the monitor when it worked, but I can't recommend the monitor unless you want to live with the problematic button and short life span. I would not buy another LG monitor with this type of power button (button/nub on the bottom of the screen).",2,2

LG,25UM56-P,5,"It's light, large, beautiful and has alot of customization options",2018-02-18,Pros:-Large screen-Beautiful display-Lots of customization features-Surprisingly light-Easy to set up-Audio jack-Has software that minimizes all your screens for you in a nice order-You can change the aspect ratio in the monitors settings,Cons:-Not alot of games and videos support 21:9 so you have to fidget around alot with everything you do to get it working but that goes for all ultrawide monitors-16:9 feels like 4:3 now,Other Thoughts:For $130? This was more than worth it. I might get a second.,2,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,IPS gamin monitor,2018-02-14,Pros:Super small bezel (if you're into that)Good response.Great color.Easy to use HUDVesa mount (pretty standard really),"Cons:No speakers.  Which it never claimed to, but it has volume feature and my system thinks it has audio.Only has HDMI interface.  No display port.  Not a deal breaker, but since my video card  doesn't support more than one HDMI cable I have to buy an additional cable to have a second monitor.","Other Thoughts:Waiting for the price to drop a little to buy a second one.  It's a great monitor. Be aware its very wide, but not super tall.  At the price point I bought it at, I don't think you could find a better monitor.",1,0

LG,25UM56-P,1,Disappointing.,2018-12-24,Pros:Good price for its size and resolution.,"Cons:Only a little more than a month after purchase, the top-left area of the monitor went black with rainbow stripes that stretch across the top of the screen. Anything placed in that area causes massive screen-wide flickering","Other Thoughts:Nice price, but needless to say, unfortunate to encounter a defect this early in its use. Not sure if we still have the original packaging, so I'm not sure if it can even be sent back at this point. Will probably look for another brand next time.",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,"Not what I pictured, but Reliable and easy to get used to.",2018-12-19,Pros:-A lot of horizontal screen real-estate.-Works well with Windows 10 and all software/games-After a year of constant use there are zero dead pixels (in both monitors) and no signs of any issues-Colors are fine for me. Seems like the colors I have set up currently tend to have darker warm tones which is something I like. I don't like excessively bright colors. I am sure this could be changed.,"Cons:-With the extension of horizontal screen real-estate comes with the lose of vertical screen real-estate. I almost returned these monitors because of this, but it is easy to get used to and is actually quite nice once I got used to it.-These monitors do not hook up using display port cables.They only have HDMI ports. Again, this was almost a deal breaker for me because my video card only has one HDMI port. Then I found cables that go from HDMI to Display Ports and this issue became a none issue. I didn't read through the specs as thoroughly as I should have.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this monitor for those looking to get a nice wide aspect ratio, primarily because I have had zero issues since I have hooked these monitors up. Since I have two I can double down on the reliability of this monitor.Another reason I went with two of this monitor was I got them during the black Friday deal of 2017.I wouldn't recommend these monitors gaming to be honest. Games work fine on them, but I play competitive fast paced games and wish I could get a higher refresh rate. This monitor can handle 70hz, but I have issues getting the refresh rate to stay put. After a restart or a shut down I have to set up the refresh rate with Nvidia control panel and the game itself and sometimes it would work and other times it would refuse. So I gave up on dealing with the refresh rate.I plan on stacking these monitors on top of each other using a vertical desk monitor mount and adding a 144hz monitor as my main monitor for gaming and other tasks.",1,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Budget Friendly but Interesting...,2018-12-03,"Pros:- Good color quality.- Ultra wide benefits (e.g. Gaming, space, etc.)- Sharp and crisp quality.- Cheap ultra wide.- VESA mount compatible.","Cons:- Smaller type of ultra wide, but it doesn't completely ruin the experience.","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these monitors yet the colors are off by the white balance. I have them sitting side by side, and it is quite noticeable. I'd be cautious if considering a double or triple monitor setup with this type of monitor.",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,3,Way too small,2018-12-01,"Pros:I made a mistake in purchasing this size and will probably return it. Ultrawide is meant to be a substitute for dual monitors, but at 25"" only gives 23"" horizontal space and 17"" vertical. I'm not sure what the point of this is, but at least it's affordable.Otherwise the quality is very good. Resolution and color quality are outstanding for the price.","Cons:- Very limited stand adjustability. Only tilts vertically, and very slightly.- Like other reviews said, it's very bright. Difficult to make it dim and still readable. This is a con for me in a dark room. Could be a pro in a bright office.","Other Thoughts:I would not recommend this unless you're a) extremely short on desk space, or b) only interested widescreen gaming on a budget.",0,0

Called LG support. They said they sent the screws. called back a week later--still no screws. They said it may take up to 10 business days. Then the customer service rep noticed that screws were NEVER SENT!!! So we tried one more time. It has been 3 weeks now and still no screws! I have wasted so much time with LG!!

LG,25UM56-P,5,"Awesome Price, Amazing Blacks",2017-09-15,Pros:-Blacks are very black. You'll understand if you get it. Running from Virals in the dark in Dying Light is truly terrifying.-the price is good. I paid like $120 while it was on sale.-the menu control joystick is probably one of the best monitor controls I've seen.,Cons:-none,Other Thoughts:-21:9 isn't fully supported by all games. I'm still trying to get Fallout 4 to work with the 2560x1080 res. (Not a con but you should be aware of this before you buy.),2,1
LG,25UM56-P,3,Be aware What Your Buying!,2017-08-31,Pros:1.  Great Picture at 2560x1080 (2K Monitor),"Cons:1.  Make sure your software/games can handle the wider length!2.  The Screen is 1 inch smaller in height than a Normal 11"" height monitor!  My fault for not reading the Specs on this monitor3. The HDMI cable they give you for this unit is to short,  4 to 5 more feet would have been nicer!",Other Thoughts:If LG didn't short you on this monitor in height by 1 inch it would have been a super great deal!  I run duel monitor setup and this I'm afraid is a deal breaker since my eyes keeps looking at the inch difference in height.  If this was my only monitor I would be very happy with it.  Maybe a 4K monitor would be better to my liking since I now will check for overall dimensions,2,13
LG,25UM56-P,5,Solid UltraWide,2017-08-20,"Pros:1) The pixel density of this 25"" makes it look crisper than on a 27"" or 29"" monitor of the same resolution.2) 2560 x 1080 is way cheaper than 1440p3) yes, LG is the pioneer in UltraWides4) great option in menus:  such as modes for FPS","Cons:1) the stand is too short to appreciate its size and quality, but for an extra $40 you can fix that.2) not all games support 21:9 and Youtube Black Bars are real but unnoticeable",,2,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Decent entry ultrawide,2017-08-16,Pros:-It's wide-Picture is decent-Price when on sale,Cons:-Display Port would be nice-Mine had 1 dead pixel at the clear top next to the bezel-Color correction was a lot of trial and error,"Other Thoughts:I have had this monitor about 6 months now and figured I would finally write a review. This monitor is really good if you are on a budget and like ultrawides or just want to try one. Mine had some small issues with color and the dead pixel. Now lg offered to have me send it in at there expensive to have it fixed, though I did not because I didn't have an additional backup monitor. Looking back now and how I use mine to multi-task and light game, I wish I would have got a bigger size like in the 29-35 inch range, and possibly got a 3440x1440p resolution (not because 2560x1080 doesn't look fine) more because I can run that size and the pixel density I think looks better.",2,2
LG,25UM56-P,5,Amazing for the money,2017-08-15,"Pros:The way this outputs color is great, very clear and precise, the contrast is unbelievable. Playing online games like Ark at night you will find your self at really night in a dense forest, its dark, friends ask me to stop using the torch, I say I can't see and tell them to step up their contrast ratio! You can buy 3 for the price of some others and it would be 100% worth it.","Cons:Only some games will not scale correctly its very few, have over 120 games and only a handful don't have support mainly the old ones. Not the monitors fault so none with it specifically just a reminder.","Other Thoughts:Yes when on sale, nothing will beat it for the money, looks professional, produces great color and depth along with deep blacks almost as though the screen shuts off it gets dark. Very nice for depth and shadows. Wide perfect for multitasking, anyone who works around a computer this is for you, also use it for school.",1,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,My first ultra-wide.,2017-08-09,"Pros:The extra width gives a new perspective to gaming.  You lose a little top-to-bottom real estate, but gain much more on the sides.  The color levels are good and the contrast is solid. Easy to set up.  I like the directional toggle control on the power switch that allows navigation through the menus.","Cons:When I unboxed it, I was surprised at how narrow it was top-to-bottom.  It took some getting used to, but it isn't that bad.","Other Thoughts:Order processing and shipping was very fast, as direct Newegg purchases typically are.  My new PCs have not arrived yet, so I haven't pushed the limits of this monitor yet.  If you are installing this on an older gaming machine, keep in mind the graphics card needs to work harder to fill and update more real estate on the screen.",4,2
LG,25UM56-P,4,If you see it on sale -- get it.,2017-08-02,Pros:-Simply a great panel. The 21:9 aspect ratio is so amazing coming from 16:9 you might not want to ever go back.-Amazing for the price-Astonishingly simple menu controls. LG put a joystick kind of thing under the monitor in the center and it is by far the easiest way to control a menu on a monitor I have ever seen. I would buy more of these for that alone.,"Cons:-A little too bright in the bottom right corner, but it's something I can live with.","Other Thoughts:-Screen had extremely oversaturated colors out of the box despite being calibrated. Not a big issue since the settings are so easy to use, but just something to note.",1,0

LG,25UM56-P,5,"Great monitor, reliable",2017-07-18,"Pros:Great monitor for the price. I was able to snag it for a great price of $120. Mine works perfectly. It has a great IPS panel. My particular unit has no dead pixels. Overall, an amazing ultrawide for the price.","Cons:Doesn't have built in speakers. Response time is 5 ms, would have preferred 1 ms but it's still quick enough. Did need a decent amount of picture adjustment, to fit my taste.",,0,2
LG,25UM56-P,4,"Fantastic for Office, not so much for gaming.",2017-07-14,"Pros:Light weight, easy to fit on the desk.Lots of viewing area for such a small screenLow costFantastic for office or music production, wide viewing angle.","Cons:Not great for gaming but at the price point, it is a good valueScreen is very short, it will most likely be less screen area than you are expecting.","Other Thoughts:Good value for a student, serious Gamers should look to spend on a higher level offering by LG.",1,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,Beauty beyond the cover,2017-06-21,Pros:Blacklight and anti glare are amazing. First monitor I've ever owned that doesn't strain my eyes (my 4k kills me every day).21:9 is absolutely fantastic. Great fov advantage in fps games.I play forza 3 horizon with 3620 x 1527 dsr. With vsync this monitor handles it perfectly. I haven't seen a visual hiccup yet. Absolutely beautiful display.,Cons:Not all games support 21:9. You will have to force resolutions time to time.It's not 4k. But with dsr it does compare very well and the price of this monitor makes it a serious competition.,"Other Thoughts:I'm absolutely satisfied with this monitor. I will NOT be replacing it with a 4k, that's for sure.",3,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,Very Nice,2017-06-19,"Pros:First computer build for me, and it was super nice that I caught this item while it was still on sale.Nice and long, plus the screen looks and feels great.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I can't think of anything bad right now, I'll update this if something goes wrong.",1,0
LG,25UM56-P,3,Depends on Application...,2017-05-22,"Pros:-Nice colors, dark darks.-Wiiiide. Wide.-Comes with all sorts of software that apparently accomplishes things.-Overall, things look mighty nice on this monitor.-Good for studio recording programs (DAWs) and I'm assuming, like graphs and stuff.-Price. Whatever you end up paying, it will show up on sale for cheaper a week later. 'Tis the way of life.-Is black. (In 2017, nobody likes anything white. I don't know why, and at this point I'm afraid to ask.)","Cons:-Not tall. At all.  Makes games pretty, but makes Geralt of Rivia look like Danny of DeVito.-Software that comes with it is set to load at boot. Easy to fix, just annoying.-Has a fixed base that is both short and pointed slightly down (not unlike Danny DeVito). You WILL have to put this on something and shim the front of it unless your eyes are peering out of your chest.-Gonna have to monkey with the gamma on your games, son. Or daughter.","Other Thoughts:Over all, I just can't help but think that they're taking advantage of the way that monitors are measured. Yes, it is a 25 inch. But don't go thinking that this thing is anywhere close to being square. Other than that, great monitor.",10,2
LG,25UM56-P,2,The monitor is very nice but the software and customer service ensure I never purchase another LG product,2017-05-10,Pros:The monitor is lovely and resolution is great.,"Cons:The screen split software that came with it started crashing about a month into the purchase. I contacted support, they responded in a couple of days telling me to uninstall it and install a new software called OnScreen Control. I did but it says ""There is no connected monitor"" when I am literally using the monitor to launch the application.I tried to reply to their email to tell them about it but the links in the email are broken. What kind of tech company is this?!? So basically, the 4 screen feature that was highly discussed in this description is just marketing lingo.",,3,1
LG,25UM56-P,3,"Super nice monitor, 1 wrong thing",2017-04-13,"Pros:2 Hdmi's, comes with one 1 foot hdmi cable",Cons:Came iwth a single dead pixel. It's in the bottom right o I won't even look at it 90% of the time but it'll always haunt me.,,10,5
LG,25UM56-P,5,Great Monitor,2017-03-26,Pros:Wide screen and great resolution.,Cons:The power button broke.  Cant fix it so now I have to leave the monitor on when I shut down my pc.  Frustrating.,,2,2
LG,25UM56-P,5,Doing grrat so far.,2017-03-24,Pros:loving this monitor picture is crisp and clear definitely recommend for the price.,Cons:Nothing so far :),Other Thoughts:Not a con just general knowledge if you buy this monitor and want to use 1920x1080 you will have black bars on the side.,1,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,Love the monitor! after 3 months of use.,2017-03-23,Pros:- Ultra wide really good for programming and watching movie highly recomended- it great with so much space you get for everything. except for gaming,Cons:- Not optimal for gaming.,"Other Thoughts:This is a great monitor for a dual monitor setup, would advice to get the 27"" monitor. The 25 is a bit too small as it is long but kinda shorter compare to my regular monitor.",0,1
LG,25UM56-P,4,Solid IPS on a budget,2017-03-23,"Pros:- Pretty solid colors with this IPS panel (some calibration to be expected, did not look quite the best out of box imo)- Extra width makes some multitasking easier, also most movies look fantastic- Even with 5ms response, ghosting did not seem prevalent (however, take note of response time options in display menu)- Good price (at time of purchase, ~$140)","Cons:- Stand configuration looks unbalanced at first glance, but after assembly it seems OK. May shake if you bump into desk etc but seems alright so far- Only 2 HDMI ports, no Displayport or DVI / VGA- Brightness settings may seem a bit low to some people, even at 100%- Only 60hz can be a deal breaker to some- May take a decent bit of trial and error to explore and find the best settings for you: Response time, black stabilizer, etc. Performance may be better or worse depending on how it is configured, calibration directly out of box left a bit of room for improvement","Other Thoughts:If you're looking for an IPS monitor with a bit extra space and solid performance for the price point, I'd give this a try.",1,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,Great monitor for the price!!!,2017-03-19,Pros:Easy to installGreat resolution,Cons:none so far,,0,0
LG,25UM56-P,3,Nice Monitor but it's too narrow,2017-03-09,Pros:For games like DotA 2 you need that vertical coverage for a class like the sniper.   With upgrades the sniper is at the vertical limit of the screen.,Cons:Too narrow,Other Thoughts:Otherwise great.,0,4
LG,25UM56-P,4,,2017-03-01,Pros:Beautiful monitor. Easy setup. Nice packaging. Nice and snuggly.,"Cons:The install disk was bent.  Disk was unprotected besides being in a bag with the instructions just ""floating"" around. Due to the stand and the backbone, I've had to use something to tilt the entire monitor up, since it seems angled very low.","Other Thoughts:Opened the box, it was beautiful. Unpacked, put together, easy as 123. 2 HDMI ports, one HDMI cord included. Neat little adapter. Noticed the CD was just floating in the bag along with the instructions. Held up the CD and noticed it was in an ~ pattern after my disk drive was going bonkers. No big deal. Got the drivers off LG without a problem. Love the resolution. My games look amazing on my 6GB 1060.So, regarding the mounting. Comes with the base, a little neck to connect all three. The monitor is angled downward just a bit. Enough to be annoying but the wife, being her awesome self, said ""Hey! Put a small clump of post-it notes under it. Angled up just right. This monitor is amazing. Easily deserves 5 eggs, but had to drop one egg for the few little things that bugged me.",1,1
LG,25UM56-P,4,Beautiful screen. Doesn't work with Mac's older than 2013,2017-02-27,Pros:- Nice display.- Great interface- Software is pretty useful.-Lightweight,Cons:- Doesn't work with Macs that are older than late-2013.- Only two HDMI ports.,"Other Thoughts:- Bought this for a co-worker for use with her late 2012 MBPr. It stretched the screen at 1920x1080, rather than the native resolution of 2560x1080. Spent 2 hours with Apple and LG support, no joy. I got a call back from Level 2 apple support, and found that it would only work if the display had thunderbolt on it, because once it converts to HDMI (which is required for the monitor) the resolution goes to 1920x1080p. So the clarity and beauty of the screen is wasted. I am upset, but am utilizing it for a windows machine (2014 Lenovo Thinkpad and 2015 homebuilt intel machine), where it works just fine.",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Excellent monitor!,2017-02-24,Pros:- The display is beautiful. Really love the way games look and play both through my pc and my xbox. No flicker or lag as far as I can see.- You can't beat the price for a 2k monitor.,Cons:- Not very happy about the way the software disc was packaged. It wasn't protected at all and mine was actually bent when I took it out. The disc won't boot the software at all. Just loads an empty drive folder. I found a work around but I'm not sure if it's the software I'm supposed to have. It made me feel like I could split the screen across multiple inputs but so far all I can do is split up the work that's on screen. Which is pointless since Windows 10 lets you drag and drop window tiles into different positions anyways. The monitor still gets a plus because it's wide enough that you can split up your work and it doesn't shrink up to much on screen but lost an egg for the damaged software disc and the fact that I'm not sure the software I found is the software I should have.,,0,0
LG,25UM56-P,3,"Beautiful Monitor, Really Poor Rebate Process",2017-02-19,Pros:Bought this as a holiday gift.  Impressive piece of equipment.  Recipient loves it.  Considered 2 other monitors.  Settled on this one because of a rebate.,"Cons:Submitted all required documentation a couple of days after monitor arrived.  Almost 2 months later, rebate status still reports as ""Your registration has been completed and we are waiting to receive the corresponding mail.""  Questions are directed to a 1-800 number.","Other Thoughts:I spend between $500-$1,000 a year at NewEgg, sometimes more, sometimes less.  I'll be spending a LOT less with New Egg in the future.",0,23
LG,25UM56-P,5,$100 open box ... whoa,2017-02-15,"Pros:Picked up one of these from newegg for $100 open box. I stalked it for about a year and when my price came I pounced on it. Came basically new. no dings, scratches or dead pixels. The colors were great out of the box. No calibration needed. minimal back-light bleed. Its a little hefty and thick but its not a big deal. The bezels are thin and its an all around attractive monitor.  I use as an email and social media monitor. I mounted it on a swivel arm vertically. I can fit something like 100 emails in a single screen and a round 6 months of my facebook timeline. This monitor is a scroll killer. It is great for watching movies in native aspect ratio. I just really like this monitor.",Cons:no freesync. no display port. awkward power adapter. they could have just given is a standard internal power supply. the monitor is not thin so there was no need to move the power adapter outside the unit. The external power adapter makes it more difficult to mount on a monitor arm.,,0,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,Awesome monitor for the money,2017-02-14,Pros:It has great colors compared to my old TN panel monitorUltrawide is really nice for productivity and gaming if the game you are playing supports the resolutionIt overclocked to 75hz with no problem.,"Cons:The base is a little wobbly.Would have been nice if it had a display port input, but for an older model at the sale price that I paid I cant really complain.","Other Thoughts:The 29"" with freesync  would have been nice to have, but I didn't feel like spending that much money or a monitor at this point in time.  The height of the screen on this monitor is exactly the same height as my old 19"" 16x9.  So if you are looking to put two monitors side by side that info might be useful to somebody that wants them to match.  I have this beside of a 23"" 1920x1080 and the height of the display including the bezel is roughly the same size as just the screen on my 23"".",1,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,Easy to set up looks great,2017-02-09,"Pros:-Much better than my 1920x1050 (yes 1050, that wasn't a typo) monitor.-Nice and bright-images are clear-Monitor has setting that are easy to navigate through (the power button is movable in more than one directions and based on how you pull or push it you can toggle options which is very neat)- Price that cant be beat for something of this quality",Cons:- This is by no means the fault of the makers of this product but apparently some game developers dont seem to like to support 2560x1080 (ex: MGSV has a 2560x1080 resolution option but there are black bars on the side of the screen) However most of the games i have tested work like a charm and look beautiful.,"Other Thoughts:-didnt realise how much stress it would put on my gtx 1070 but that's my fault for having an i3-6100 instead of a proper gaming processor. (some games that i used to get 60 fps are dropped to around 40ish. games that i used to get 190 fps i get around 120-150 now. :(- NOTE: I saw someones review say that you can over clock the monitor to 75hz If anyone can tell me how to do that that would be much appreciated lol-This is not a con but its a bit shorter than i anticipated, but that doesn't really take too much out of the viewing experience.",1,1

This monitor is perfect for what I do. I use this monitor for work when I am at home as well as some occasional gaming here and there and it has yet to let me down. All the setting's are easily accessible through a very easy to use settings interface and the quality and build of the monitor feels and looks very high end.

So i'm running at 2560x1080 @ 75hz through a custom resolution in my nvidia control panel and it works perfectly fine. The diference between 60hz and 75hz is very noticable. Especially since my previous LCD was 75hz.I bought this LCD to pair up with a Track IR 5 and star citizen. Star citizen of course is still in alpha, and they broke trackIR support, but still this LCD is nice.Moving from a 16:9 or 16:10 monitor to a 21:9 monitor takes a bit of getting used to.25"" is perfect for me. It could be taller, but the width is very nice. It'll be really good in games like star citizen. Maybe being able to see to my sides a little better, i'll stop smacking into so many asteroids.",1,1
LG,25UM56-P,1,Terrible Screen Size,2016-12-15,Pros:The quality build of the product was good,Cons:-Screen Height is NOT sufficient for any real professional usage-The glossy finish of the screen gets annoying rather fast-High priced/bad price to screen size ratio-4-Screen Split is virtually useless because of the small size of the screen,"Other Thoughts:personally, I would simply recommend if you can afford it, spend $50 more or so just go with the 29' screen because this is simply of no real world use for everyday usage, ESPECIALLY for the office environment. I had the intention of using this screen ration for excel spreadsheets and analyzing data, but like previously mentioned, the screen size is simply too short in terms of height for one to be able to do so comfortably. I would recommend, if you have the money and can afford to do so to buy at least a 29' screen and if you can't then just go with a flatscreen IPS monitor because it will definitely have much better screen uniformity in terms of the height to width ratio",3,27
LG,25UM56-P,4,Looks can be deceiving.,2016-12-14,Pros:I hated this when I took it out of the box. I felt like I was losing space going from my widescreen 24 in to the ultra wide 25 in. It wasn't until game play that I really saw what this monitor could do. The colors are amazing. At a foot and a half away I fell like my eyes get lost in the screen in a good way. I was really surprised.,Cons:The price is a little on the high side. The CD with the drivers on it did not work on windows 10 not really needed. I'm having a few issues with it need more time to see how it goes.,Other Thoughts:The price is a little on the high side.,0,1
LG,25UM56-P,4,"Great monitor, different",2016-12-13,"Pros:The wide screen makes it very easy to put two windows side-by-side without any distortion of the webpage rendering.When used in vertical mode, two pages can be viewed length wise in a standard word document.","Cons:The screen was smaller than I was expecting.  Although it is considered 2k, the height is much less than my 23"" monitor.  I bought this one to use for document viewing and editing so it's ok, but I would have probably gone with the 27"" or 29"" widescreen.The color defaults are different from other LG products, so if you are using alongside another monitor you may have trouble getting the colors to match.  The menu navigation can be somewhat tricky at first if you are not used to the menu controls.","Other Thoughts:The menu ""button"" is in the center on the bottom of the frame and is actually more of a joystick.  I am using this monitor with a two-monitor stand.",0,0

LG,25UM56-P,3,The hardware itself is excellent,2016-12-10,Pros:The monitor itself is excellent. It has served me very well for almost exactly 1 year now. I would have never thought of using an ultrawide monitor until I noticed this one and really started looking in to them. So I pulled the trigger and it has changed the way I use my office computer. If I have to type bills I can have docs covering about 1/3 the screen for what I'm typing up and then use the rest for looking up prices or address of where a job was... it's just really handy. Then I can use my laptop screen off to the side for things like the calculator.It's made things very organized to the point of it being an enjoyable experience.,"Cons:This monitor did not come with the software that Newegg and LG claimed it was supposed to come with in the product description. It clearly stated that this monitor could do the 4 screen split... in the owners manual, it claims that this software was included in the monitor box. On the LG website, this model isn't even listed on the main list... you have to dig for it, and then LG claims that it is ""Plug and Play"" with no available software. Every other ultrawide monitor has the software available for download to the advertised 4 screen split except this one. And this was the main reason I bought the thing in the first place.","Other Thoughts:The product itself is great, as the title says. It's just it really ticks me off that the big feature to set this monitor apart isn't available and when you go to the LG support page.... you find out there is no support.",0,1

This means that things will appear in th 16:9 ratio with black bars on the sides. It isnt that bad considering that during browsing the internet, coding, etc. it looks great. Also, chances are that most games will go on to offer more support for the 21:9 ratio. Overall, it looks great and I got it while it was on sale.",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,Overall great monitor for the price paid,2016-12-04,Pros:21:9 monitor. Paid 150 and would have to say it so far has been worth it. Image quality is much better than my last monitor.,Cons:Very bright even at lowest settings. 21:9 support is also abysmal which I have found out the hard way. 16:9 is by far the resolution most compatible with everything,"Other Thoughts:No points taken off for my cons as neither has anything to do with the monitor itself. I have a bit of a light sensitivity and almost always have my monitors down at the lowest brightness possible. 21:9 support for games, videos, etc is also not something that the manufacturer should have to bake in. This more reflects upon developers of said programs, content creators, etc",0,0
LG,25UM56-P,3,Beautiful screen!,2016-11-27,Pros:- Great for FPS games with low input lag.,"Cons:- Has volume controls in the menu, but doesn't have speakers? Well that's stupid.- My screen tends to glitch whenever I change the settings from default. Not a big deal, but I knocked off 2 eggs for that alone.

However, this disc wasn't packaged in a sleeve which I felt was a bit shoddy.When I put the disc in and told it to install the software I was taken to a website which I thought was weird and the software they have for this monitor isn't anything that's required nor is it something that really helps. The only software that could potentially help me was the screen split but all it does is section your windows on your screen. It's the same as re-sizing the window and placing it wherever you want which seems like a waste of hard drive space to me.Update:After owning this monitor for a little over 8 months I've found that several games do NOT support ultra widescreen monitors therefore I've had to either rely on the modding community to create a workaround for me or I've had to reduce my game's video to 1920x1080.",Other Thoughts:The software for this monitor is ridiculous.

(GTX 970, usaully on high-Ultra) 5ms latency isnt noticeable at allHaving more horizontal space is optimal for Photoshop and Video Edit programs once you find an optimal arrangement, its Also much more immersive for gaming because it fills up more field of view.The gaming and photo presets work like a treat, and with 99% color range its great for photo editing.",Cons:Works well for a smaller desk size with about 1 3/4 feet from monitor to eye. any longer distance you would want a bigger size.Not best for Writing and some web browsing  due to small vertical spaceNo tilt or hight adjust on included stand,"Other Thoughts:I might buy 2 more, its amazing quality, features and advantages over regular 16:9 monitors, for the price, its must buy in my book. would totally recommend.",3,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Great display but....,2016-11-09,"Pros:Man, I mean its sexy and sleek. Im amazed by the colors. It beats my other two displays hands down. The ultra wide is really a unique experience. I wish I had two more.","Cons:This isnt NewEgg fault. When watching movies, not all movies play in 21:9 mode. The black bars leech light from the LED backlight through the black in all four corners and is distracting. I fault monitor design for this. For the price though ($149) I can deal with it. Not acceptable for a high price monitor. I take off one egg for this flaw.","Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a cheap intro into ultra wide screens, this cant be beat for the price. Its not a true gaming monitor as its only 60hz and 5ms response. Simply out dated specs. I do, however, recommend this product because the colors are just fantastic and it looks so beautiful. I would certainly buy 2 more for a surround video experience until I can afford higher quality ultra wide displays. LG is also a respectable brand.",2,0

This monitor has a higher resolution than 1080p, which makes for more work space and more immersive gaming. I don't think I could ever go back to 1080p. Overall, this is a good choice if you're on a very strict budget.",6,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,Great Starter Monitor,2016-10-11,Pros:Not to wide not to small just right. HDMI inputs are great along with the audio output jack for speakers area really nice feature.

Alot of games have weird 21:9 support and the low vertical height will cause issues.Docked 1 egg for the stand and vertical height. This should be explained better on the purchase page.,2,0

I would say for this price this monitor is unbeatable in quality as well. For an ultrawide display it looks great! I only wish it had Display Port so that it would run even smoother. However, no complaints. The colors, temperature, and contrast looks great once adjusted a bit in game, etc. Would definitely recommend for those wanting a nice monitor without spending too much $. It is not that tall so will fit most desks easily.(Only thing is with setting up the mount plate be sure to center it because it seems to tilt a little to the right. Had to adjust the screws to make it stand up straight.)",3,1
LG,25UM56-P,4,Great monitor,2016-06-22,Pros:The software the monitor comes with is great. It allows you to split the screen in many ways. It really helps with productivity. It looks small in the box and when its off but when your using it its fine. I love the extended view in games.,"Cons:Even though the bezils are extremely thin, no image is displayed for a cm. thick around the monitor which annoys me because i wanted another one of these monitors.

LG,25UM56-P,5,Great,2016-06-21,"Pros:Great for all kinds of things. I don't consider this a gaming monitor even though I gamed on it a few times, but I think it's still great. Color setting is okay. You have a choice of 4 settings and you can even adjust them too. To have a better gaming experience make sure to change ""response time"".",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I have a gaming monitor and I needed a monitor for other things like 3d modeling, browsing, sound editing, and other things.

I mostly play CS:GO, and while the HUD was a little messed up, in game it worked perfectly. I could stand at the top of spawn in Shoots and see both sides of the map where the sandbags are. Great investment.","Cons:For some reason, the video is really messed up for everything that's not gaming. When I open Chrome, for example, the tabs and text at the top are almost indistinguishable, and some text and nearly all form boxes are virtually invisible. I've tried resetting the settings and messing around with saturation, γ, brightness, black level etc to no avail. Luckily for me I have a second monitor, but this is just a weird issue.",,1,3

LG,25UM56-P,2,Disappointed in Customer Service,2016-05-27,Pros:The monitor itself is excellent. The color range is great and it is easy on the eyes during long sessions.,"Cons:The only real con of the monitor involves it's customer service. After about 6 months of owning the monitor it would intermittently lose the back light on half of the screen. Through testing it was found to be the monitor and not my computer or other input devices. After talking to customer service they agreed to send me a new one after I sent it back. It was estimated to take a week each way (2 weeks total). I asked if there was any other solution we could come to because of my need for a monitor and not having a backup, but the customer service representative offered me nothing. The willingness to exchange my monitor is great, but I really can't go 2 weeks without a monitor to do my work. And buying a second one while i wait for my exchange just seems silly and wasteful. Without this I give the monitor 5 stars every time.",,2,15

I took a chance and bought an open box item, but I'm very glad that I did.  I looked at this monitor for almost two years and wondered if it would be a good idea, and I'm glad I finally sprung for it.  It doesn't have Freesync, but it does have a proprietary LG HDMI overdrive that lowers input latency and whatnot.  Frankly, it is plenty fast enough on any setting while connected to my MSI R7 265.  Games that support the ultrawide resolution are absolutely mesmerizing, and games that don't ... well, they are awesome in borderless windows while I surf the web.

Some games do not support ultrawide resolutions such as this monitor (2560x1080) or would partially support it like the HUD would be stretched but the game itself would be fine. Call of Duty: Black Ops III had this problem. Many games still support the resolution and it looks amazing! Rocket League, Star Wars: Battlefront, CS:S, and Just Cause 3 to name a few worked perfect.

Decent response times, colors are nice and it's WIDE. If you don't want to have to fiddle with it (or deal with broken UI elements because of the 21:9 thing) then I wouldn't recommend this monitor to you.",3,6
LG,25UM56-P,5,best ultrawide on a budget,2015-12-08,Pros:ipsnice response timecheapest ultrawide monitornice pixel density2 hdmi,Cons:no displayportcould not get 2560x1080 with dp to HDMI cable.,,1,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,love it,2015-12-07,Pros:I bought two of them and I love it! the resolution is amazing. very clear. I can fit so many things on my screen now. Monitor size is slightly small height-wise but is perfect width. These monitors are HDMI only so make sure you got the right video card or adapter.,"Cons:having multiple input connections aside from the HDMI would be better. this monitor screen size is only about 11-12"" tall",Other Thoughts:i definitely recommend this,0,0
LG,25UM56-P,5,"Great IPS, good pixel density, excellent response time.",2015-12-05,"Pros:The colors really jump out at you, IPS is so superior to TN, I could never go back. More surprising is the contrast, brights are bright, darks are dark, video looks great, but games, games look incredible. I can't believe the amount of detail I simply haven't noticed, a great example is a sunrise in Fallout 4 on Ultra, epic. Response times are surprisingly good on this monitor, IPS has come a long way the last few years. While it has a gaming mode, I've found it's not even necessary, pixel switching is great, every bit as good as my 2ms TN panel I upgraded from. The gamer modes are definitely noticeable, if you're competitive and play games like CS:GO or Battlefield, you'll want to use them. The OSD is very simple and the joystick is easy to use, takes 3 seconds to choose gamer mode, select a profile, done. Another thing I like is if you try to use the monitor outside it's native resolution, it'll display a notification on screen so that you're aware, this is a nice touch for less technical people, it'll help them to realize the situation and set the proper resolution. Gaming support is hit or miss, but there's always an INI file to edit if you must, I've gotten every game I own so far to work, though I've had to edit a few INI's in the process, very easy though. Some games will continue to display the main UI and Menus in 16/9 ratio, but once in game, if you've set your resolution to a proper 2560x1080, you're good to go. Important - Though it says it's a glare screen, it is not, it has a great anti-glare coating and looks outstanding, even near my window which gets a lot of direct sunlight in the early hours of the day.The stand is very nice, it reminds me of the star ship Enterprise from Star Trek, the way it rests in the back and holds the panel out front. Bezels are small, but they're glossy. They're extremely thin around the top and sides but the bottom is typically thick, I find glossy very annoying, collects dust, fingerprints, everything, though easy to clean. I hope one day panel manufacturers will realize many of us don't care for the shiny glaring gloss finishes, this only exists for showroom reasons, but most of these are bought and sold online, it's no longer necessary to make your panel stand out in this way!Lastly, viewing angles are far better than any TN panel, but only average among IPS, which is still very good. If you plan to use it as a monitor and not a TV, it's perfectly good.Overall, I love the contrast, anti-glare screen (even though it says it's glare in the specs, it's not, and thank goodness) and color reproduction, absolutely outstanding. Also, because of the 25"" size, and this particular resolution, pixel density is a bit better than your standard 23"" or 24"" 1080p panel, images are sharper and text as well. On sale I think it's a must buy if you're looking for an IPS ultrawide panel.",Cons:None so far,,1,0
LG,25UM56-P,2,"Good monitor, but with problems",2015-12-05,"Pros:The 25UM56P is a beast of a productivity monitor for me, excellent color reproduction for a monitor at its price and also has some handy gaming related settings that do improve the responsiveness related to input lag.","Cons:One of my biggest gripes with this monitor is the stripe flicker that occurs on the bottom third of the panel whenever working in 3d or playing a 3d game. I've tested two identical panels and both of them have this issue on an R9 285, a GTX 780, and possibly a notebook's GT 750M SLI config. Its a real shame too for the price the panels are going for. Im still testing monitor settings, but so far it seems to be DAS mode being the culprit, though more testing needs to be done.",,5,3

LG,25UM56-P,5,Instantly works amazing!,2015-12-04,"Pros:With the included HDMI Cable, all I did was plug it into the monitor and then to the back of my PC, my PC knew exactly what resolution it needed to be immediately and looked amazing already! You can even hook up Game Consoles (Sure they may not be at 21:9) but they look amazing anyway because of the very low response time!","Cons:The LG Software is a bit lacking and honestly, they should make it more clear that the Screen Split feature does not let you use the 2 HDMI inputs and use it as two different square monitors, without a Windows or Mac Device with the software already installed.",,2,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Great screen on a budget.,2015-12-03,"Pros:IPS, great color and deep blacks.For IPS, 5ms and 60hz, play BF4 on these with no screen tearing that I can see.I have read that they can be OC'D to higher hz. I have tried and my panel goes to about 76hz stable.  On 60hz now as Im used to it.  Good to I can bump them up if needed.","Cons:discoloration on my panel on the bottom left corner of the screen, after calibration, still shows a pinkish hue over black.",,2,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,Money well spent.,2015-12-02,Pros:At 149.99 + the 10$ rebate it can't get any better than that for a nice 2560x1080 ultra wide 21:9 monitor. The gaming experience feels so much better and no flickering at all. As a added bonus wide screen movies look really spectacular never imagined enjoying my first 21:9 ratio monitor but looking forward to my future purchase.,Cons:The only downside that I found was like the person below mentioned the software program disk they give is pretty wacky and the only one you really need would be to split the screen software the other stuff on the disk are pretty useless in my opinion.Also be aware that some games don't support 21:9 ratio so you might have to configure some files in the game to make it work.,Other Thoughts:Didn't give a 5 star simply cause of the software disk other than that it would of been a 5 for me. I would like to mention it was my first purchase through newegg and with the holiday sales and stuff it got here within 2 days after I ordered and that was with the standard free shipping. Amazing service and look froward to buying more stuff through them.,2,0
LG,25UM56-P,4,What a find,2015-12-01,"Pros:25 inch ultrawide for under $160? (precisely $157.58) That's near unheard of.The picture is nice and clear, and as usual you will need to make those minor adjustments (brightness contrast) so the picture looks correct in your own eyes.  Dual HDMI is awesome, I can switch between my PC and PS4 on the fly.  The inputs is limited to HDMI though, no DVI or Dsub, but with those quickly being replaced by HDMI, that's not a problem.  HDMI is basically USB for video, and not needing an extra AUX cord is a plus, I've never used HDMI before this monitor and it's fantastic.This monitor does NOT have built in speakers, I knew this before buying, but there is a headphone jack on the back you can plug some small clip on laptop speakers into and it'll have the same effect.  The monitor refresh rate is limited to 30Hz, which at this price, I'm not complaining.  Human eyes can only detect ""picture-by-picture"" effect on anything below 15Hz, so 30Hz and above will make everything look like it's moving fairly smooth, even on fast paced racing games like GTA 5 and NFS, the flicker is unnoticeable, cause flicker is non-existent, unlike what one reviewer stated.Back onto the monitor, only one thing I can really complain about, look in the cons sections.","Cons:The software.They REALLY need to get their software working right.  The LG dual control should let you control 2 computers, but both need to be connected to the monitor and both need to have a wireless network connection (or wired, any way you get internet to both machines will work).  The computers both need to have the software installed (obviously) and ran as ""Main computer"" (the one with keyboard and mouse) and ""Sub computer"" the one connected through the internet.  The software made it seem that as long as it was displaying to an LG monitor, you could switch between machines.  If you're going to use this bit of frustrating software, you need to have both computers connected, which BTW is useless considering you can just switch the HDMI inputs.The screen split software is also kind of frustrating.  On startup, it will display a grid according to your settings, so if you have it off, it will display one pink rectangle going around the border of your display, a 2 split will have 2 rectangles and pink line going down the center (these disappear after 2 seconds BTW) and a 4 split will have 4 rectangles.  This software doesn't change anything, you can still move windows around like normal, you can still full screen a browser, you don't have 4 miniature desktops, it's just kind of there, like that awkward kid in high school.If you're going to use anything on the CD, it's the driver for the additional settings that can be used.","Other Thoughts:The monitor is FANTASTIC, though the software (knocked an egg off for the software), I'm gonna remove after I have posted this review, and get a remote desktop client.",0,2

LG,25UM56-P,5,Great buy for the price!,2015-11-11,"Pros:IPS, Ultrawide, Overclocked to 75hrz without a hitch and is perfect for having a 3rd monitor above my two 27' panels. Amazing color reproduction and a lot of awesome built in settings :) Nvidia adaptive sync (not gsync, but great for what it is, only applies vsync when needed) 2560x1080 and I keep my desktop on it, gotta mention the blacks on this are GREAT; awesome for movies that support 21:9","Cons:Honestly, none - For 150$ you seriously can't get better, it's really high resolution, ips and ultra wide with adaptive sync.I think it's a wonderful deal!","Other Thoughts:Don't buy it unless it's on sale, because it tends to dip to 170-150 quite often!",25,3

Many applications do not support this aspect ratio (awkward looking websites, games sometimes have to be scaled down, video applications are not easily adapted unless it's physical or digital media locally run on apps that support all ratios.

LG,25UM56-P,5,Never going back,2015-10-10,"Pros:Nearly everything.  Overclocked it to 70hz without any trouble, may push it more later on if I wish it, know it has more to give.An impulse buy on my part, I wasn't sure I'd even like the ultrawide.  But honestly, I took the change just as well as the upgrade to 1080p years back.  It's exciting and has more utility than you'd initially think.There's even a decent amount of wallpapers.  And if there's not enough for your taste, get 1440p wallpapers.  At the same width, they work fine.","Cons:Speakers don't work.  Who cares.Not everything supports ultrawide.  Netflix, for example.  It has content recorded at cinema resolutions, BUT, it cuts off the sides to keep things squared out at the traditional 1080p resolution.  FOX, however, figured it out, and watching shows on their site really makes it feel cinematic.  I expect the rest to follow suit.Games (loading screens especially) don't always support it either, but that will change with time.  The actual game content will fill out, even if menus don't.","Other Thoughts:Get it.  Note my previous review claiming I'd go full 1440p instead, and had decided not to get this.  Changed my mind.  Now the only way I'm going 1440p, is with ultrawide.",2,2
LG,25UM56-P,5,Get you some Ultra Wide Lovin!!,2015-10-09,"Pros:Wanted to try Widescreen gaming, this monitor was a cheap way to test the waters. I am hooked.

As others have posted in their reviews I guess it supposed to have built in speakers but they don't work.If that is important to you then it's a con.,"Other Thoughts:29"" is probably the best for 2560 x 1080, at 34"" the pixel density is too low and things start to look poopy.The 25"" fits my desk and seems plenty big enough. If you are tight on space but still want a wide screen the LG 25UM56-P is the way to go and its tough to beat the picture quality for the price.",0,1
LG,25UM56-P,5,Worth the try,2015-10-06,"Pros:For starters it's very useful for video games with its ultra wide high pixel count, great for FPS. Clear videos great for editing, haven't start editing photos yet tho I'm pretty sure I won't be disappointed. Have two HDMI inputs that you can switch from your menu stick, you can definitely wall mount, and can separate it's desktop space from 2-4 in the same one monitor. True Black? Very good.","Cons:Not much to say far as cons goes.

LG,25UM56-P,5,Better then what I thought,2015-09-25,"Pros:Got this when it was on sale for 199.99 + 20 off and that was the BEST deal I got for this little guy. Thought it would be too small, but guess I was wrong on that. Easy to hook up though the HDMI and not to mention that super fast shipping. Super fast, I mean 24hr shipping. Quality of the  screen, as well the lighting, is great as well.","Cons:Only gripe I have. wish the power cable was a little bit longer. This is somewhat compare to other screen that had a brick style for the power. It is not a bad thing or anything, but make sure you have some extra extension cables or somethin around. But that is just me","Other Thoughts:I kno some others were sayin somethin about audio being bad/not work. By the time of this review. I can't get the speakers (on the display)to work, but the pass though (the 35mm jack on the back) works well.

My main purpose for getting this monitor was to watch movies and yes it lived up to my expectations. movies are excellent. on normal monitors there's usually black getting wasted on both top and bottom of the screen. this monitor wastes to room.  It was also very cheap for an ultra wide monitor.I recommend this monitor for both multitasking and watching movies it does a great job.,Cons:I was expecting it to be a little taller maybe 21:12 or something but its pretty good.,Other Thoughts:If you reading this comment and your like me getting worried if its the right choice or the wrong one just consider what your purpose is and check more into the specs.,0,0

Im not good enough to see the difference between one nice display and the next but I could say that this one is pretty good.Lots of brightness, I had to turn mine down a good amount and its still brightEasy to put together, did not have to read directions.",Cons:Only 2 HDMI ports. I paid only $150 for this new (not the $300+ advertised price) so I do not find it an issue.Cannot rotate the display to make it taller than it is wide.. that would be nice for programming but I did not buy it for that anyways.,Other Thoughts:I purchased this last minute because of how cheep it was. Gaming on a 21:9 ratio is pretty awesome but not what it is hyped out to be. For the $150 I paid I would buy another OR MORE.,1,0

LG,25UM56-P,4,Great for the money.,2015-09-13,"Pros:- A good size. Others have called it small, but for me (considering my typical viewing distance) it's just right. Any bigger, and paying attention to the entire screen would have been a real issue in situations where that's necessary. PPI is also solid due to the size.- Well-built. The stand feels sturdy, even if you can wiggle the screen from side to side a bit.- No dead/stuck pixels on mine.- Excellent image thanks to the IPS display.- I'm a fan of the control stick method after getting used to it.","Cons:- Like others have said, the speakers didn't work. Another reviewer mentioned enabling HDMI audio, but that did nothing for me. It MUST be on the computer end, as I simply don't believe so many people could have gotten a model with faulty speakers. Thankfully, I don't need them!- The bezel is very thin, but the actual display area doesn't start until about a centimeter into the panel. I'm not sure the ""falsely skinny"" bezel is worth the extra layer of annoyance it creates in adjusting the monitor.","Other Thoughts:I bought this as a sort of compromise between a standard monitor and a full 1440p display. The cheapest good-quality one of those would have been $100 more and taxed my GPU a bit too much. This way, I get some extra screen real estate for multitasking and widescreen gaming without breaking the bank on anything else.It might not be as big lengthwise as a dual-1080p-display setup, but I like it a lot better. In photo-editing particularly,  there's something psychologically pleasing about being able to view your image and several different adjustment windows at the same time without having to cross the ""barrier"" between monitors.",0,1

You will be limited to 30HZ refresh rate at 2560x1080 on HDMI, as the current HDMI standard only has 60HZ support to 1080p.Very short power cable.

LG,25UM56-P,4,21:9 is indeed impressive!,2015-08-06,"Pros:- I'm amazed at how much more I can see both on the desktop as well as in games; the cinematic 21:9 resolution is definitely legit!- The clarity of this monitor is very well done. Compared to my old Viewsonic IPS monitor, which served me well, I'd say it looks much more vivid color wise. Going from 1000:1 to 5,000,000:1 contrast ratio definitely shows up!- This thing is LIGHT. Like, half as light as my old monitor... But bigger? How does that work!? It's neat!- The Dual Controller app is quite neat, even though I can't use it to its full potential (read cons below), it allows me to control my HTPC without having to dig another keyboard out.","Cons:- The Dual Controller app doesn't work fully. By that I mean, it's supposed to let you have two monitors or inputs show up at the same time on one monitor from 2 PCs... But there's no option to enable it on the monitor's menu. Kind of a bummer.- Only 2 HDMI inputs? Really? This thing could have had at least an extra DVI port or display port... But for the price I got it, eh, works out. I have a receiver to handle input switching for that. Still, these last two cons take an egg off the final product in my experience.- I didn't find the screen splitting program to work that well. It does work, but just not as fluently as Windows' default window splitting. Windows 10 has further support for four way splitting anyway. Not a huge con, but I just didn't find it useful enough.","Other Thoughts:The only main issue I've had with this monitor is getting it to work with my setup.I have 3 inputs I need to connect to this monitor, but my receiver doesn't support 21:9 resolution formats. So I'm currently testing out a new receiver with HDMI 2.0 that will hopefully solve that problem.-Make sure your receiver supports HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2 if you want the proper resolution to pass through the receiver at 2560x1080p! Research pays!-This monitor will definitely surprise you, but if you have the room, I would recommend the bigger (29""/34"") variants. Come join the 21:9 club!",2,2
LG,25UM56-P,5,Newly 21:9 converted.,2015-08-02,"Pros:Colors look great, excellent viewing angles. This is my first time owning an ultrawide 21:9 monitor, and I can not go back. Watching on my 46"" LED after using this monitor, I feel as if I'm missing something.The extra space gained over a traditional monitor is a huge bonus. It is a monumental upgrade when it comes to gaming.","Cons:25"" UW means the monitor is not very tall. I would think 29"" would be the ideal size for UW, but 25"" is more than suitable as long as you're not sitting very far away. I sit about ~24 inches away, and I can see everything just fine.No speakers, which is an issue for some, not for me.","Other Thoughts:It truly converted me to 21:9 for life. When I do upgrade monitors at some point in the future, I will certainly be looking to go bigger. This is a life changing upgrade when it comes to gaming. I seriously can not stress this enough.",1,1

I cannot comment on that functional aspect of the monitor*,Cons:I have less money because of this monitor.,"Other Thoughts:This thing is awesome. If you have an older monitor and are looking for an upgrade I would strongly consider this one. The first thing that I noticed about this monitor was the solid feel and overall look. The panel is non-glare, which is awesome for me because there is always a light on in the room. The bit of extra screen real-estate makes a considerable difference to my web browsing and gaming sessions.There is one thing that I knew would happen if I were to buy this monitor. The only thing I dislike, but is NOT a con, is that I have to turn down some of the graphical settings in a few of my games. I'm running a 2GB 770 and many of my games still look good aside from more recent AAA titles. So if you don't mind a little graphics hit, or if you got to money to get this thing, I would suggest in doing so.NO RAGRETS.",5,1

Response time is great and my 970X handles it with no problems.Cinema view is awesome; watching movies like ""Django Unchained"" in the format they were filmed in with without the letterboxing you get on a 16:9 is AWESOME.It's also got a ""dual monitor"" feature which lets you split-screen the monitor as if it were two different monitors, each with about an old-school 4:3","Cons:It's wider than I thought, but honestly not as big as I thought it would be. It's a hair shorter than the 22"" Vizio 1080p TV I was using as a second monitor.It came from the factory with brightness set to 100% and still isn't as bright as I would like, so I'm counting off for that. But the response time is pretty good.I've had some troubles running some games; many require editing of .ini files to run in native resolution. Be warned of what you're getting into - this isn't exactly a plug-and-play-and-everything-is-perfect type of setup (and this goes for any Ultra wide-screen monitor).","Other Thoughts:A pretty good entry-level into the world of Ultra Wide Screen gaming, or for those who prefer acres and acres of Windows desktop for multitasking without moving to separate monitors.",4,2

AOC,27B1H,1,Terrible ghosting,2018-12-07,"Pros:- The ghosting is 'tolerable' if you're just browsing the web or watching most videos. Hardly a ""pro,"" though.","Cons:- Experiences VERY bad inverse ghosting and motion blur. None of the available overdrive settings fixed it, and enabling the advertised ""clear image technology"" only made it worse, somehow. Changing it from my HDMI -> Display Port adapter to direct HDMI input had no effect. Changing the input port had no effect. Changing the HDMI cable used had no effect. All games tried were at the native resolution with the proper (60Hz) refresh rate. No matter what I have tried, the ghosting problem persists, leading me to conclude that the problem lies in the monitor itself.","Other Thoughts:The monitor 'works' technically. Day-to-day web browsing is fine; I only notice any ghosting that occurs there because my testing has made me acutely aware of it.

AOC,G2260VWQ6,2,More headache than functionality,2019-03-16,Pros:-It's a relatively affordable monitor-Great response time-Plenty of input options-3.5mm audio out,"Cons:-The advertised FreeSync capabilities are only available through the use of an optional driver which is UNSIGNED and IN BETA. This also applies to the use of Nvidia's G-Sync. Furthermore, this driver exists only on the CD that comes with the monitor: the download link on the AOC support site downloads only the installation instructions. This was a problem for me, since there was no CD in my package (which also means no manual).-The colors are washed out, and no amount of tinkering with the OSD's settings can rectify them, as the options are severely limited (e.g. only 3 possible gamma values). Extensive adjustment in the Nvidia or Catalyst Control Panel can get the needed results.-If you're not using a VESA arm, forget about it. The stand is flimsy and very wobbly; typing and mouse movement cause the screen to jiggle distractingly.-The monitor takes an absurdly long time to awaken when input is restored (about five seconds).-The OSD is clumsy and difficult to use without installing the manufacturer's bloatware.","Other Thoughts:If you're going to use this monitor on a VESA mount and aren't planning to make use of adaptive refresh rates, this is a good monitor for the money (assuming you're willing to spend a lot of time in your display adapter's settings).

I wouldn't recommend this product as far as my experience with it is concerned. Instead look for a higher hz limit especially if you're gaming. One could consider this to be second monitor material but I've heard your framerate in-game can be limited by your least powerful monitor (i.e. this one).

I play a lot of Battlefield 5 and had been wanting to upgrade to faster speed monitor. The problem was they were too expensive, and if I was going to pay that kind of money I wanted it to look super nice and be slim bezel.

AOC,G2260VWQ6,2,"Low cost, but even lower quality",2019-01-13,Pros:- It did not cost a lot.- It is 1080p.- There were no dead pixels.,"Cons:TERRIBLE contrast performance. sRGB mode is artificially faked and the dithering (noise) is VERY obvious in dark areas (< 8% brightness). In other color modes it's impossible to get anywhere near true black with the monitors brightness and contrast settings. If you want it dark you end up with garbage contrast. If you want decent contrast, black looks almost medium gray. There is no gamma adjustment, just a couple gamma modes. Overall the monitor is painfully bright and there's no way to fix it without ruining the appearance of dark areas.There is also some obvious vignetting around the edge of the display.Also the stand is really cheap. I was planning to mount this on a VESA arm, so I didn't care, but it does suck.I have returned this product for a refund.","Other Thoughts:I did not own this long enough to test the nVidia Gsync compatibility, so I don't know how it performs as a ""gaming"" monitor. I have owned a Dell P2411H for many years and have been really happy with it, so I guess I expected a newer monitor to have somewhat comparable performance, but I guess I was wrong. I'm surprised at how many good reviews this has, but maybe it's just me being particular about image quality.Buy this ASUS monitor if you don't care about refresh rates, it seems to perform at least a little better in terms of contrast and brightness: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236755It also has a much better stand.",0,8

RMA service was fine initially, but instead of sending me another monitor without this issue, they gave me a refund for what I paid via the Cyber Monday deal. I bought a monitor protection plan through Squaretrade (via Newegg), which I am unsure of what to do with now.Now I need to pay an additional $40 for this product again, as the Cyber Monday deal is gone, and figure out what to do with the Squaretrade warranty, all because I was unlucky enough to get a defective product.Considering the headache this has become, I can't help but feel like the customer service from Newegg was a good bit lacking.Having a way of honoring the previous deal and helping me sort through the warranty stuff with Squaretrade I thought would be something they'd do, but all I've seen so far is ""Here's a refund, you've got to sort out the rest.""I am disappointed the policies or whatever things are in place aren't more thoughtful and accommodating of the customer.I've had way worse customer service experiences through the years at other companies, but I've held up Newegg on a different level. I am just kind of baffled and disappointed about how they handled this situation, as it isn't up to the standards I've seen and heard from them through the years.I've been a huge fan of Newegg and generally tried to order almost all of my computer parts through them, and recommend them to others.I'm just fairly disappointed in the outcome here, as all I wanted was a monitor that didn't have dead pixels, and I assumed Newegg would do a better job of helping me out with that.",9,4

It's slightly off putting at first but once you become accustomed to it you can switch settings very fast mid game.NOT REALLY A CON FOR ME:-colors are like a benq (dull and not very vibrant) but I only threw that in there because most casual gamers might be surprised by them.  I don't mind at all because I mostly play FPS games competitively.,"Other Thoughts:I have had benq monitors and they heard people speak of miracles from asus.  This monitor performs as good as, if not better, than a benq and blows away asus monitors.  My first 144hz was one of the 23"" cheaper benq monitors and it was great, but when I switched to intel chipsets in my gpu something seemed off about it because of the amount of customization you have with nvidia drivers.  I had an asus 27"" 1ms monitor advertised at 144hz but it was falsely advertised.  I found out later that it was actually made for console gaming and that's why it didn't come with a DVI-D cable and only an HDMI.  The asus monitor was also advertised at 144hz w/1ms (and still is) but after I purchased the description was changed to ""console gaming monitor"" which means it was meant to be used with consoles that could only push 60 fps at the time.  I went from that asus monitor to this AOC monitor and it is absolutely wonderful.I was worried at first because I had not heard of AOC before so I didn't know if it sold reliable products and I didn't know anything about what kind of rep they have.  I took a leap of faith and ordered this monitor and I am so happy that I did.  I will never go back to benq or asus for a monitor ever again.(some people find the colors lackluster for this monitor but if you're competitive as I am the colors do not matter.  If you're a casual gamer who really loves to be immersed by the beauty of a landscape this monitor will need tweaking to get the colors the way you want them.)",8,1

I wouldn't recommend this product as far as my experience with it is concerned. Instead look for a higher hz limit especially if you're gaming. One could consider this to be second monitor material but I've heard your framerate in-game can be limited by your least powerful monitor (i.e. this one). So even if you have a 144hz monitor, if this is hooked up your framerate will be capped at 60, maybe lower. Consider getting something else",1,6

I play a lot of Battlefield 5 and had been wanting to upgrade to faster speed monitor. The problem was they were too expensive, and if I was going to pay that kind of money I wanted it to look super nice and be slim bezel. This AOC was the only one that could do all of that and stay under $200! Also it was one of the 12 monitors that Gsync certified that were Freesync compatible.PROS:- 144hz- 24.5"" (slightly larger than most in its class)- TN panel with vibrant colors. (Really quite impressed with this TN)- Freesync + GSYNC now available!

AOC,G2260VWQ6,2,"Low cost, but even lower quality",2019-01-13,Pros:- It did not cost a lot.- It is 1080p.- There were no dead pixels.,"Cons:TERRIBLE contrast performance. sRGB mode is artificially faked and the dithering (noise) is VERY obvious in dark areas (< 8% brightness). In other color modes it's impossible to get anywhere near true black with the monitors brightness and contrast settings. If you want it dark you end up with garbage contrast. If you want decent contrast, black looks almost medium gray. There is no gamma adjustment, just a couple gamma modes. Overall the monitor is painfully bright and there's no way to fix it without ruining the appearance of dark areas.There is also some obvious vignetting around the edge of the display.Also the stand is really cheap. I was planning to mount this on a VESA arm, so I didn't care, but it does suck.I have returned this product for a refund.","Other Thoughts:I did not own this long enough to test the nVidia Gsync compatibility, so I don't know how it performs as a ""gaming"" monitor. I have owned a Dell P2411H for many years and have been really happy with it, so I guess I expected a newer monitor to have somewhat comparable performance, but I guess I was wrong. I'm surprised at how many good reviews this has, but maybe it's just me being particular about image quality.Buy this ASUS monitor if you don't care about refresh rates, it seems to perform at least a little better in terms of contrast and brightness: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236755It also has a much better stand.",0,8

AOC,G2260VWQ6,3,"Product was terrific, service from Newegg wasn't",2018-12-08,"Pros:- Monitor worked great. 144Hz refresh rate made things so smooth.- Colors/settings needed some tweaks, but I got things to look really, really good by messing with the options.- This monitor is as advertised, a nice looking TN panel at a great price.- Was overall VERY happy with my purchase, until I got some dead pixels.- I would have given this 5 eggs based on the product alone.","Cons:- Viewing angles can be more strict than you're used to with IPS panels.- You'll probably want to spend some time adjusting the settings to get this dialed in perfectly.- Had dead pixels, so needed to RMA it and that's when the problems really began.","Other Thoughts:I wanted to give this feedback to Newegg directly, but when I clicked on the customer support option, there was a queue of almost 200 people to live chat with an agent, and I couldn't find an option to email them.I bought this as a Cyber Monday deal, got dead pixels, so needed to RMA it. RMA service was fine initially, but instead of sending me another monitor without this issue, they gave me a refund for what I paid via the Cyber Monday deal. I bought a monitor protection plan through Squaretrade (via Newegg), which I am unsure of what to do with now.Now I need to pay an additional $40 for this product again, as the Cyber Monday deal is gone, and figure out what to do with the Squaretrade warranty, all because I was unlucky enough to get a defective product.Considering the headache this has become, I can't help but feel like the customer service from Newegg was a good bit lacking.Having a way of honoring the previous deal and helping me sort through the warranty stuff with Squaretrade I thought would be something they'd do, but all I've seen so far is ""Here's a refund, you've got to sort out the rest.""I am disappointed the policies or whatever things are in place aren't more thoughtful and accommodating of the customer.I've had way worse customer service experiences through the years at other companies, but I've held up Newegg on a different level. I am just kind of baffled and disappointed about how they handled this situation, as it isn't up to the standards I've seen and heard from them through the years.I've been a huge fan of Newegg and generally tried to order almost all of my computer parts through them, and recommend them to others.I'm just fairly disappointed in the outcome here, as all I wanted was a monitor that didn't have dead pixels, and I assumed Newegg would do a better job of helping me out with that.",9,4

It's slightly off putting at first but once you become accustomed to it you can switch settings very fast mid game.NOT REALLY A CON FOR ME:-colors are like a benq (dull and not very vibrant) but I only threw that in there because most casual gamers might be surprised by them.  I don't mind at all because I mostly play FPS games competitively.,"Other Thoughts:I have had benq monitors and they heard people speak of miracles from asus.  This monitor performs as good as, if not better, than a benq and blows away asus monitors.  My first 144hz was one of the 23"" cheaper benq monitors and it was great, but when I switched to intel chipsets in my gpu something seemed off about it because of the amount of customization you have with nvidia drivers.  I had an asus 27"" 1ms monitor advertised at 144hz but it was falsely advertised.  I found out later that it was actually made for console gaming and that's why it didn't come with a DVI-D cable and only an HDMI.  The asus monitor was also advertised at 144hz w/1ms (and still is) but after I purchased the description was changed to ""console gaming monitor"" which means it was meant to be used with consoles that could only push 60 fps at the time.  I went from that asus monitor to this AOC monitor and it is absolutely wonderful.I was worried at first because I had not heard of AOC before so I didn't know if it sold reliable products and I didn't know anything about what kind of rep they have.  I took a leap of faith and ordered this monitor and I am so happy that I did.  I will never go back to benq or asus for a monitor ever again.(some people find the colors lackluster for this monitor but if you're competitive as I am the colors do not matter.  If you're a casual gamer who really loves to be immersed by the beauty of a landscape this monitor will need tweaking to get the colors the way you want them.)",8,1

This is false.,"Cons:This is advertised as being hdmi capable, when used, the monitor made static noises and ultimately went black several times, and stated that it could not use that display, switched to display port which my radeon 580 is Specifically built to do, and has been blinking black again but without the static. At one point it completely blacked out and said no signal even though the cables are fine, the card is fine, and after a reboot it has worked sort of, threatening to black out full again several times.

AOC,G2260VWQ6,1,rma 2 times,2018-07-28,Pros:The monitor is beautiful out of box.,Cons:The monitor does not work outside of the desktop. I purchased this for a gaming rig unfortunately the first monitor worked fine up until I tried to play a game. Upon startup the monitor crackled and shorted out. Lots of popping noises and eventually turned itself back on. As soon as it started up again it immediately crackled with visual light coming from back of monitor (electricity) and shut off once again. So I RMA the product because it was defective. Received “new” monitor to test again and same issues arose immediately again.On a side note I thin Newegg sent me the same monitor or referbished back. Reason I believe this is because initially the product shipped from Indiana through ontrac. The second shipment was directly from where I sent the RMA product. And the box only had scotch tape sealing the original box.,Other Thoughts:I will be returning this product for full refund as I need a monitor that will not potentially electrocute me.,2,1

Monitor height even though it's not adjustable seems perfect for me. This monitor features a newly designed TN panel, and the reason I purchased it. Originally I was trying to locate a G2590PX, however this is the same monitor without the adjustable stand, USB hub, and additional inputs. Out of the box the monitor colors looked fairly bright and washed out. I made a few initial adjustments I'll pass along in case it helps someone.

You MUST buy your own DVI, DisplayPort, or VGA cables.- There's a single audio in port (yellow) that you can plug into the monitor, but I've never used it.- I bought 4 of these at a stellar price ($99.99) back early 2017. They are now primary/secondary monitors for my wife and I.- I went from 22 and 23 inch LCD monitors, 1 at about 5 years old and another over 15 years old and I'm happy I went with these guys.- You can notice the quality when playing games and when you connect a console (PS4 in my case) to it.

AOC,G2260VWQ6,5,Awesome basic gaming monitor,2018-07-09,"Pros:It’s a great basic monitor for gaming that looks good too.  Gameplay is smooth because of the high refresh and FreeSync.  The low input lag mode is noticeable in some games and has actually helped my scores a little.  The resolution is perfect for the size, and the size is perfect for me.  I didn’t want to have a monitor with too large a footprint.  I haven’t done it yet, but I plan to have a 3 monitor multi-display setup.

Not weak enough for it to fall over on one side, however-Only came with a VGA wire, not even a DP, let alone HDMI","Other Thoughts:I just now got this monitor, with no dead pixels or any defects.

AOC,G2260VWQ6,5,Gets the job done,2018-06-26,Pros:Light enough to mount two on really cheap arms.Picture and colors through DisplayPort are excellent.No dead/stuck pixels on either one of the two I bought.,Cons:none,Other Thoughts:Blacks on HDMI look very washed out when compared side by side to DisplayPort so if you buy for multiple monitor setup then be sure to use the same video connections for each one.,1,0

Would recommend this to anyone that's using an AMD card but is limited to a budget.",Cons:The only Con is something that I really don't see as a dealbreaker and that's the built-in speakers.  At this price range and the only thing that is wrong are the speakers is a blessing.  Anyway who really use the built-in speakers?

I see a lot of people saying it only runs at 60Hz instead of 75Hz.Vsync Automatically goes to 60hz. You have to go into Nvidea Control panel and go to display and then resolution and change the refresh rate to 75Hz. I run this monitor at 75 no problem at 1080p,5,1

It took me roughly 4-5 minutes to get it out of the box, read all of the little things they stick on the screen and plug it into my computer setup. It looks really crisp, and I have to see I'm pretty impressed with the quality for the price. However, there's one thing that caught my eye and made me cringe just a bit.The Included a VGA cable instead of HDMI or Display Port.This is an odd move to me, and I immediately threw it out and used one of my old HDMI cables lying around. I'm now ordering a Display port cable to try out the 75hz and Freesync settings.",Cons:- Came with a VGA cable,"Other Thoughts:Really nice budget monitor, just make sure to buy a Display Port cable prior to ordering.",0,1

For 99$ this was a great deal. It doesn't compare to my BenQ Zowie 1440p 144hz, but that monitor costs 5x as much.The other (first) reviewer is not very smart considering he doesn't understand technology or how to set anything up.

The stand easily wobbles. There is noticeable back-light bleeding around the edges and minor clouding (white glowing patch) on the center of the screen. It's noticeable when viewing dark images or setting the screen brightness and contrast down. I also get an occasional low whining noise which gets louder if I set the refresh rate higher than 60hz.,Other Thoughts:The monitor does not come with a HDMI or displayport cable.

(And DisplayPort only for such functions)- Lacks external speakers that higher-standard HDMI and DisplayPort cables may utilize for audio output.- Turning on the monitor puts out the white AOC logo at default display settings before loading the actual settings, which can be hurtful at dark environments.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend buying them while during significant sales periods. I deem the HDMI and DisplayPort plugs as useful, especially when planning which graphics card would benefit from Freesync or DisplayPort-only workstation cards.Coincidentally, the brush black texture matches with the black wood texture computer desk, and the red monitor accent matches with the red accent PC internals.This would be a suitable monitor for AMD graphics while it is affordable, just be mindful that there may not be a Driver CD included in the box (I did not find it in the box, despite being in the box's instructions that says it has one).Get the Driver from the AOC website, search for the specific model of the monitor, as Windows usually recognizes the monitor as AOC 2260, which is not the exact model when there are other 2260s from that manufacturer.

I love Newegg but I don't love that they let this blatantly false info on their website. Luckily now it says that its 75hz but I would still doubt that it has a dvi-d port or the speakers or even that tilting feature. The best part is that in the preview images on the product page it still shows no visible speakers and definitely no dvi-d port, just more blatant lies.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this IF AND ONLY IF Newegg/AOC told the truth about this monito: a 75hz monitor with no dvi-d port or speakers or even a tilt feature not the 144hz with speakers and dvi-d port like it was advertised to me.,3,27

Newegg takes no responsibility for whats advertised on their own website.Doesn't come with a display port cable either to even use the Freesync, you have to buy that seperatly.

I had posted a review and ended up putting out some incorrect instructions.To get freesync to work you have to install the drivers for the screen.  Doing this can be a hassle for novice computer users, and I find it slightly aggravating the freesync controls aren't integrated into the monitors settings, so you know it's activated.Go to the website (http://aoc-europe.com/en/products/g2260vwq6) to get the newest driver, as of 3/31/16 it's a Beta driver that supports F-Sync from 35hz-60hz, but it say's 35-75hz, it's 35-60hz... The driver disc in your box, if you have one, is 35-55.  I mixed them up and couldn't figure out what was going on and why my freesync wasn't working, it was an unpleasant experience.  You have to download the newest driver from the site.Just noticed the back-light bleed, it's sort of bugging me now.  Honestly, I wouldn't have shipped this to people, but anyway, I don't have the gumption to return it.  I got it working now, everything's peachy.You may want to lock games at 59fps, 60fps may still cause tearing... I find 59 to be the optimal spot.  You can do this with MSI Afterburner and Riva Tuner.  Once that's done, open AMD Control Panel and set ""Frame Rate Target Control"" to 59 as well...  Turn V-Syncs off...  Download Windmill (https://www.asuswebstorage.com/navigate/s/2B197749034A48E1B00E4B3B5EDFFC66Y), check and see if Freesync is working, there shouldn't be any screen tearing among the settings.. VSYNC OFF.$150, I'm not upset.  I'm sure your run of the mill user will be flabberghasted with this feat of modern engineering.You also have to turn off driver signing in windows to install the drivers, find a tutorial for that.o7",4,1
AOC,G2260VWQ6,4,Good FreeSync range... with a catch,2016-02-21,"Pros:Reasonably priced for Freesync-Enabled display35hz FreeSync floor (with Beta Driver).Matte, anti-glare coating",Cons:Noticable backlight bleedingOfficial FreeSync driver only goes down to 48 hz (range: 48-75)Beta FreeSync driver must run on 60hz or lots of flickering (Effective range: 35-60 instead of 35-75)Does NOT come with a DisplayPort cable!,"Other Thoughts:Brightness is fairly high. Even the ""0"" setting is quite brightAs soon as they fix the bug with running the beta FreeSync driver @75hz, this would be near perfect. However, 35-60hz is still a pretty reasonable range, and better than anything else at this price point. If you're looking for a FreeSync monitor at this price point, chances are, you care more about the minimum refresh rate than the maximum anyway.",6,1

Acer,EB321HQU Awidpx (UM.JE1AA.A03),4,One tiny flaw - unable to turn off audo input source switching,2018-09-25,Pros:nice,Cons:see below,"Other Thoughts:One user commented that this monitor has a very annoying flaw, every time PC goes to sleep (in his case this acer panel and a Dell S2417DG) this Acer panel disconnects from my computer and causes all of the windows on it to be forced onto the Dell monitor. In my case I also happen to have a Dell panel and the same issue happens to me as well, running Win 10. I think the root cause of this issue is because there's no way to turn off the automatic input source switching, so when the PC goes into sleep, the monitor starts to cycle through the 3 input sources, and in my case couldn't find any, and it goes to some sort of deep sleep mode that essentially disconnects from the PC, or maybe it doesn't disconnect yet but when the PC wakes up this monitor takes a bit longer to wake up causing Win 10 to believe the monitor is disconnected for a few second. Either way, Win 10 pushes all windows to the other monitor.Fortunately I have a Nvidia Quadro card, which allows me to force load EDID for this panel. It's a bit technical with EDID so I'm not going into too much details here but you can look it up and learn all about it. Basically once I force load the EDID for this Acer panel (or for any monitor/projector) the system treats that device always connected, hence solves that annoying sleep issue.However be careful with force loading EDID tho, because the system treats the monitor as always connected, it may fail when you disconnect it, causing the graphics card not to output signal to the monitor that's actually connected, and you might not get any signal. Just be sure to unload EDID before unplug the monitor.",2,0

I bought this monitor to replace a 27"" Samsung, the difference is night and day.  This Acer blows the Samsung out of the water in every respect.  Takes up  the SAME space as my Samsung, which has a huge bezel.I like that there is no power brick, just a standard power cord.  Makes for a lot less clutter.

Acer,EB321HQU Awidpx (UM.JE1AA.A03),5,Excellent upgrade in all respects,2018-07-13,Pros:- 16:9 format is optimal for most games- nice colors out of the box- included DP cable works well- no power brick (for those that care about that kind of stuff)- 2560 resolution is great Office products like Word and Excel- stand is nice and sturdy on my desk- VESA mount capable- 60HZ feels fine in the games I play (Destiny 2 and COD WW2),Cons:- none,"Other Thoughts:Was looking to upgrade from a 27"" IPS 1080p monitor, and needed to decide if it was time to try a 144hz monitor, or increase my screen size/resolution.I have an AOC 29"" 2560x1080P ultra-wide monitor, and while I love the color accuracy, and the extra width for apps like Lightroom, I never took to that extra width when playing games.  So that ruled out the popular 34"" UW models that are really hot right now.  144HZ + a bigger screen/resolution was out of the question due to cost, so I needed to figure out what was most important for a ""noticeable everyday upgrade"".  Everyone says that the only people that don't appreciate 144hz monitors, are people that have never used one.  having never used one.  I can't dispute that, never having gamed on one, but I couldn't find anything lacking about any of my 60hz monitors, so I let the 144hz idea go.  The 32"" Acer has been on a great sale price for a while, so I decided to pull the trigger, and go for it.  Great call on my part.Color out of the box was great, and the included profiles were solid, as well.  My 29"" AOC UW is calibrated for sRGB photo processing, and the Acer, out of the box, was really close to that -- very nice.  The increased resolution is great for Office productivity, striking a nice balance between 1080p, and 4k, for my old eyes still being able to see small text in apps, and having the extra space to position open apps/windows.Gaming with a Ryzen 1600X@3.90GHZ + an EVGA 1080 FTW2, is fantastic.  I mainly play Destiny 2, and COD WW2, and my PvP experience was just as solid as gaming on a 1080p 1ms screen (4ms for the Acer), with the bigger screen being great for my older eyes (poor closeup vision).  I increased the DPI on my mouse to 4000 (to help account for the increased in-game resolution), and witnessed no screen tearing, stutters, anything like that.  Honestly, this chased away any buyer's remorse for not going for a 144hz monitor, so I think I've put that ""want"" to rest.  We'll see...lolSome people really look for ultra-thin bezels in a monitor, but not important to me.  The Acer bezels are around 3/8"", so good enough for me.  The screen is relatively thin, and while I do have it setup on a large desk, I've decided to take advantage of the VESA mount, and stick the Acer on a wall-mounted arm.  The included connectivity options + the included DP cable had me running within 3 minutes of cutting the box open.Overall, zero to complain about here -- only good.  If you're looking for a larger resolution screen, and play fast-paced FPS games, while mixing in office productivity type tasks, you will be hard pressed -- especially for the current price of $260 -- to find a better screen experience than what's offered by the Acer.  Great stuff here -- I highly recommend it!",7,1

Acer,EB321HQU Awidpx (UM.JE1AA.A03),3,Beautiful display but has a flaw (for me),2018-02-19,Pros:Gorgeous IPS panelMassive sizePrice (Got it for $289.99 on sale)VESA mount capable (I don't know why every monitor doesn't have a VESA mount),Cons:Only 60hzPPI (93ppi is lower than I'm used to but it's not a problem really)Not sure how new this monitor is but there is very limited information available online about it (as of 02/16/2018)Sleep mode (unchangeable) fully disconnects the monitor from computer (at least for my computer),"Other Thoughts:TL;DRGood monitor but the disconnecting issue ruins it for me with my multi monitor setupThis is a massive and gorgeous display. I used to have a 34"" 3440x1440 panel but this panel ""feels"" larger than that one even because of the 16:9 aspect ratio vs the 21:9 aspect ratio of the 3440x1440 panel. The QHD resolution works well on this monitor and I think is definitely the minimum resolution I would recommend on a panel this size. A 1920x1080 panel would have a very low PPI and would almost be a waste of real estate.Anyway, back to the monitor at hand. The white coloring is not an issue as it is on the back side of the panel and the small white rim that runs around the front of the panel is a tasteful accent (IMO). The IPS panel is gorgeous and has good viewing angles without any issues. My unit did have one dead/stuck pixel in the upper left corner but if anything is on the screen it is basically impossible to see. I didn't use the included stand because I mounted it on an arm so I can't comment on that. All I know is that the included stand is very basic. I wish acer would come up with a more modern On Screen Display (OSD) because this one literally has the same menu system as a monitor I bought back in 2010.  Overall it is a very good monitor for the price I paid.With that being said, there is 1 major flaw (at least for my setup) that I found with this display. No matter what I do, every time my monitors go to sleep (This acer panel and a Dell S2417DG) the Acer panel disconnects from my computer and causes all of the windows on it to be forced onto the Dell monitor. I tried adjusting the DisplayPort settings within the monitor's menu and did plenty of searching to see what I could do to resolve this issue, but alas, I couldn't find anything to fix it for me. So therefore I am returning this monitor, which is a shame. I've never had a problem with acer panels and have been using them on every one of my builds since about 2010 because they are a great bargain for what you get.",29,4

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great monitor without dreaming about perfect FreeSync,2019-03-13,"Pros:-Decent color reproduction for a TN panel, but requires calibration. (Just realistic expectation from a TN panel, not expecting it to be as anywhere close to the accuracy of its IPS and VA panel brothers and sisters.-Game Plus functions is a huge plus (for FPS games)-Fast response time and refresh rates.-Back I/O is not obsolete. (but also not the most convenient compared to some of its MSI brand model counterparts)-Finger distinguishable buttons to the back of the monitor for reasonably easy access.-Well packaged, easy unpacking, assembling, and setup. (expected quality from ASUS)-Has FreeSync support (This is also a HUGE con, more about that in the con area.)-Budget and brought it when it had $20 dollars off.-It's a monitor, you are getting everything it has to offer at a reasonable price tag!","Cons:Now, the cons.-Horrible FreeSync (G-Sync Compatible) support. Extreme brightness flickering every time you click on something or move with your mouse. I have done quite a bunch of research and found out that this is a common problem with FreeSync monitors due to its limitations on refresh rate range. For a G-Sync Compatible (Nvidia Tested product), I find it astonishing bad and unacceptable. The brightness flickering can be horrendously annoying and extremely distracting in any competitive games that require extreme focus. Honestly speaking, I don't think there is much of anything that ASUS and AMD can do to remedy the issue as it is more of the software limitations of FreeSync (and really just how FreeSync is able to be widely popular with no extra loyalty fee and keep the price low compared to those of G-Sync models). Now, if I were to blame, I'd say Nvidia should be taking full responsibility as this model was actually one of their first batch of approved G-Sync compatible monitors.-The game plus buttons would be much better if it is located on the bottom of the monitor like the design on VG248QE with LED indicator.","Other Thoughts:With THE con out of the way, I'd still recommend this monitor as it is a very well priced model and the functionalities it offers easily outweighs the con. However, I would definitely not recommend this monitor if you are doing any sort of video editing or design work with casual gaming. Despite my praise of its color reproduction, it is nevertheless a TN panel monitor. It can be good for games, but it will surely not be good enough for designs. Instead, try VG279Q (IPS panel with all the bells and whistles that this monitor offers with just a slightly higher price tag, I will review that monitor as well.) Good luck fellow Egg-ers!",0,0

My other monitor would have a bright blue light blink when it slept and it was annoying, You can just turn off your PC with these and they auto sleep with no annoying lights.- Connectors face down so you can get them closer to the wall, saves desk space, also has solid sturdy cable management build into the base.","Cons:No real cons to this monitor, just nitpicks.- I have two and they aren't exactly matched up in terms of stand positioning. It's a minor annoyance.- There's red on the base, would be better if it was just pure black, not really a big deal though.","Other Thoughts:I was pretty good at shooters (mostly played COD Black Ops), and when I got these monitors I became insanely good.

ASUS,VG278Q,1,"It's time to let this one fade into the oblivion of old tech, folks.",2018-08-14,Pros:+Fairly inexpensive 144hz monitor with lightboost capability.,"Cons:-Back-light bleed. Upon setting up this monitor next to my VE248H, I immediately noticed the horrid back-light bleed. No matter how I adjusted the color/brightness/contrast, the back-light bleed was quite an eyesore. I tend to prefer black desktop backgrounds so it was substantially more noticeable. Not only was there a lot of back-light bleed, it was also unevenly distributed across the ENTIRE monitor, not just the edges.-Tilt DOWN. If you have a setup like mine and require a monitor to tilt down at all, this monitor did not tilt down, but it would tilt up quite a lot.-Colors/Brightness/Contrast. All of these things need some SERIOUS tuning out of the box. Especially if you intend to use the Lightboost mode. In 3D aka Lightboost mode, you cannot adjust the colors on the monitor itself, only the contrast, so you will need to use software to do so. This monitor is BRIIIIIIIGHT.-Profile mode settings reset? I fine tuned my settings on ""standard"" mode, then went to another mode to compare, and went back and all my settings were reset. So make sure you write yours settings down in-case you ever change modes.>>>>Tracefree. This isn't really a con but I'm putting this here as advice for buyers. IF YOU BUY THIS MONITOR, DO NOT USE TRACEFREE 100, USE 80 MAX. Tracefree 100 introduces weird, ugliness when moving anything on the screen, and becomes especially an eyesore in games. It took me a while to realize which setting I changed that introduced the problem.","Other Thoughts:EDIT: UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW months later, after owning an ASUS ROG Swift PG278QR for a while now I lowered the egg rating of this monitor to 1 egg from 2! DO NOT BUY VG248QE!!!!!!!!!! Save up the extra cash and get something newer, you will not be disappointed with the newer asus monitors. I can honestly say that I was skeptical at first but GSYNC/FREESYNC are NOT gimmicks! They make a game feel buttery smooth! All of the issues you can read about below that i was having with the vg248 are nonexistant with the newer asus monitor I bought. No eye-strain, no weird backlight issues, etcetc.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite this monitor's problems, 144Hz will absolutely spoil you and you will never want to use a 60Hz monitor for gaming again. Being able to pan the camera around in games and still see things very crisp and clear makes me wonder why we ever left CRT monitors to begin with.... ok.. I mean, I know why. It's just that in contrast with your run of the mill 60Hz monitor, 144Hz is really, REALLY great for gaming(if you can get high FPS).Another thing of note is the weird eye-strain-like feeling this monitor gave me after even short periods of use. This may have been because this monitor is extraordinarily BRIGHT. Or maybe it's due to high refresh rate? Perhaps it was due to lightboost? I didn't have the monitor in my possession long enough to test different settings to gauge the eye strain, and  I really don't know until I try more high refresh monitors. All I know is I don't get the feeling when I use my VE248H.I was not happy with the way video looked @ 144hz on this monitor, but, again, I am not including this in the cons as I am not sure if this a problem with video in general @ 144Hz, or this particular model. To be more specific, watching a video on the VG248 vs the VE248 was much more of an eyesore. Every little imperfection seemed to become glaringly obvious. I found myself trying to find 90+fps , 1080p with at least 15,000kbps bitrate, video to see if it made any difference, but I couldn't find anything but 60fps video, which still had the same glaring imperfections. I may just be an overly sensitive video-phile though. All I know is it is much more of a joy to watch a 60FPS video on my VE248 vs the VG248.I fell into the trap of ""inexpensive 144Hz upgrade"" but my viewing experience was only improved in games in which I could achieve 100+ fps, and was diminished in other areas such as video playback, weird eye-strain, bad colors, and back-light bleed. Overall my opinion is to simply let this particular tech fade into oblivion and perhaps look into buying something newer. I want to go back to 100+ Hz monitors for sure, but I don't want to sacrifice overall viewing experience. Lesson learned.",10,7

It came with Freesync, 75hz refresh rate and fantastic IPS screen and worked very well with my sons Radeon R9 380. Unfortunately the 2560x1080 resolution did not play nice with some of his games, resulting in big black borders, windowed gaming or ugly stretch. So being a good dad I wanted to buy something that worked with all of his games and gave him fast refresh rate along with adaptive sync. I searched Google and found this monitor and bought it on an impulse and have not been disappointed.Adaptive sync works perfectly, no screen tears even at the highest refresh rates of 144hz. While my son only has an R9 380, this screen is 1080, so most of his games with med to high details will happily run above 120hz. The colors are pretty good out of the box but excellent when I calibrated using my color munki.The 2W speakers are usable, but my son as a 2.0 Creative speaker system, so not really necessary. My son loves the cross hair feature, thinks it makes him a better gamer, lol...The stand is fully adjustable and works well in typical Asus fashion. I really can't fault this monitor.I'd recommend this monitor, even for someone with an Nvidia gpu, although the adaptive sync technology wont work, you still get a 144hz refresh rate with 1ms response time and great color (when calibrated).....",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Extremely good monitor for it's price.,2018-07-12,"Pros:- Really good size for its price, widescreen at its' finest.- Packaging is great; comes with a DVI cable, HDMI, etc.- The colors are great and you can adjust the settings easily. In addition to the color, there are no dead pixels on the monitor I received.- Has an adjustable stand that is easy to put together and provides all kinds of rotational direction.- Very sleek design; looks clean and professional, might use it as a workstation monitor.","Cons:- Powered through a powerbrick adapter.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great monitor without dreaming about perfect FreeSync,2019-03-13,"Pros:-Decent color reproduction for a TN panel, but requires calibration. (Just realistic expectation from a TN panel, not expecting it to be as anywhere close to the accuracy of its IPS and VA panel brothers and sisters.-Game Plus functions is a huge plus (for FPS games)-Fast response time and refresh rates.-Back I/O is not obsolete. (but also not the most convenient compared to some of its MSI brand model counterparts)-Finger distinguishable buttons to the back of the monitor for reasonably easy access.-Well packaged, easy unpacking, assembling, and setup. (expected quality from ASUS)-Has FreeSync support (This is also a HUGE con, more about that in the con area.)-Budget and brought it when it had $20 dollars off.-It's a monitor, you are getting everything it has to offer at a reasonable price tag!","Cons:Now, the cons.-Horrible FreeSync (G-Sync Compatible) support. Extreme brightness flickering every time you click on something or move with your mouse. I have done quite a bunch of research and found out that this is a common problem with FreeSync monitors due to its limitations on refresh rate range. For a G-Sync Compatible (Nvidia Tested product), I find it astonishing bad and unacceptable. The brightness flickering can be horrendously annoying and extremely distracting in any competitive games that require extreme focus. Honestly speaking, I don't think there is much of anything that ASUS and AMD can do to remedy the issue as it is more of the software limitations of FreeSync (and really just how FreeSync is able to be widely popular with no extra loyalty fee and keep the price low compared to those of G-Sync models). Now, if I were to blame, I'd say Nvidia should be taking full responsibility as this model was actually one of their first batch of approved G-Sync compatible monitors.-The game plus buttons would be much better if it is located on the bottom of the monitor like the design on VG248QE with LED indicator.","Other Thoughts:With THE con out of the way, I'd still recommend this monitor as it is a very well priced model and the functionalities it offers easily outweighs the con. However, I would definitely not recommend this monitor if you are doing any sort of video editing or design work with casual gaming. Despite my praise of its color reproduction, it is nevertheless a TN panel monitor. It can be good for games, but it will surely not be good enough for designs. Instead, try VG279Q (IPS panel with all the bells and whistles that this monitor offers with just a slightly higher price tag, I will review that monitor as well.) Good luck fellow Egg-ers!",0,0

My other monitor would have a bright blue light blink when it slept and it was annoying, You can just turn off your PC with these and they auto sleep with no annoying lights.- Connectors face down so you can get them closer to the wall, saves desk space, also has solid sturdy cable management build into the base.","Cons:No real cons to this monitor, just nitpicks.- I have two and they aren't exactly matched up in terms of stand positioning. It's a minor annoyance.- There's red on the base, would be better if it was just pure black, not really a big deal though.","Other Thoughts:I was pretty good at shooters (mostly played COD Black Ops), and when I got these monitors I became insanely good. I think the 144hz and response made all the difference from my 60hz and whatever response older monitors. Many tears were made to flow from raging nerds when I absolutely destroyed games.

ASUS,VG278Q,1,"It's time to let this one fade into the oblivion of old tech, folks.",2018-08-14,Pros:+Fairly inexpensive 144hz monitor with lightboost capability.,"Cons:-Back-light bleed. Upon setting up this monitor next to my VE248H, I immediately noticed the horrid back-light bleed. No matter how I adjusted the color/brightness/contrast, the back-light bleed was quite an eyesore. I tend to prefer black desktop backgrounds so it was substantially more noticeable. Not only was there a lot of back-light bleed, it was also unevenly distributed across the ENTIRE monitor, not just the edges.-Tilt DOWN. If you have a setup like mine and require a monitor to tilt down at all, this monitor did not tilt down, but it would tilt up quite a lot.-Colors/Brightness/Contrast. All of these things need some SERIOUS tuning out of the box. Especially if you intend to use the Lightboost mode. In 3D aka Lightboost mode, you cannot adjust the colors on the monitor itself, only the contrast, so you will need to use software to do so. This monitor is BRIIIIIIIGHT.-Profile mode settings reset? I fine tuned my settings on ""standard"" mode, then went to another mode to compare, and went back and all my settings were reset. So make sure you write yours settings down in-case you ever change modes.>>>>Tracefree. This isn't really a con but I'm putting this here as advice for buyers. IF YOU BUY THIS MONITOR, DO NOT USE TRACEFREE 100, USE 80 MAX. Tracefree 100 introduces weird, ugliness when moving anything on the screen, and becomes especially an eyesore in games. It took me a while to realize which setting I changed that introduced the problem.","Other Thoughts:EDIT: UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW months later, after owning an ASUS ROG Swift PG278QR for a while now I lowered the egg rating of this monitor to 1 egg from 2! DO NOT BUY VG248QE!!!!!!!!!! Save up the extra cash and get something newer, you will not be disappointed with the newer asus monitors. I can honestly say that I was skeptical at first but GSYNC/FREESYNC are NOT gimmicks! They make a game feel buttery smooth! All of the issues you can read about below that i was having with the vg248 are nonexistant with the newer asus monitor I bought. No eye-strain, no weird backlight issues, etcetc.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite this monitor's problems, 144Hz will absolutely spoil you and you will never want to use a 60Hz monitor for gaming again. Being able to pan the camera around in games and still see things very crisp and clear makes me wonder why we ever left CRT monitors to begin with.... ok.. I mean, I know why. It's just that in contrast with your run of the mill 60Hz monitor, 144Hz is really, REALLY great for gaming(if you can get high FPS).Another thing of note is the weird eye-strain-like feeling this monitor gave me after even short periods of use. This may have been because this monitor is extraordinarily BRIGHT. Or maybe it's due to high refresh rate? Perhaps it was due to lightboost? I didn't have the monitor in my possession long enough to test different settings to gauge the eye strain, and  I really don't know until I try more high refresh monitors. All I know is I don't get the feeling when I use my VE248H.I was not happy with the way video looked @ 144hz on this monitor, but, again, I am not including this in the cons as I am not sure if this a problem with video in general @ 144Hz, or this particular model.

It can happen to any monitor though so be sure to take the warranty into consideration.","Other Thoughts:Technology has come a long way, but this monitor is still solid. (you will probably want to buy a longer hdmi or display port cable because the ones it comes with are pretty short. I'm not sure if you can get a longer power cord, but it's fairly short as well)I would recommend this to people who are looking for a gaming monitor (especially if they plan on playing a competitive fps), but aren't that interested spending extra for g-sync 4k or UHD. I think lack of g-sync is kind of a deal breaker today, unless a monitor with it puts you over budget, considering there's a lot of other monitors with similar specs that have it now. Some people cant tell the difference in smoothness between V-sync and G-sync though so I guess it depends if you can live without it or not. If I had it to do over again I'd probably spend extra and get one with G-sync just because I bought a gtx 970 at the time and I could notice slight stuttering in a few games.

At the end of the day I would absolutely recommend this monitor to any serious gamer. Plus for the price you can't complain.,Cons:Colors were kinda washed out when I first set the monitor up but did a little searching for color settings and it looks just fine.

Also I think I had one issue with the monitor not displaying but the cable wasn't completely plugged into the monitor or the GPU so once I securely set it in place there were never any problems again. You will need a DVI cable to utilize the glory of the 144hz.For those who are shopping, take into account the GPU you have. A GTX1070 is probably too much for this monitor and you'd be better off going at least 2K to utilize the full power of your card since this monitor is only 1080p.",4,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,I've got two and they are the best value for gaming,2018-01-28,Pros:- Blazing fast 144Hz- Awesome screen- Perfect size- Awesome value for true 144Hz gaming,Cons:- None,Other Thoughts:This is my second monitor of this exact same model. The first one I purchased was refurbished and then I decided to get another monitor for convenience sake.,2,2
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Good But Pricey,2018-01-24,"Pros:* 144 Hz, 1ms is extremely smooth for games (a big step up from 60 Hz)* Adjustable stand that rotates to portrait is more than most monitors offer* Simple black bezel (no jarring colors) with cable management is nice","Cons:* About 3 days after having it running, it developed a stuck pixel (bright blue on dark backgrounds) about half way between the center and right side. Warranty information has a chart that idicates ""General ZBD Models"" have a zero-bright policy. There is no indication wether this monitor falls under ""ZBD"" or one of the other types.* The backlight is too bright. After spending a week with various calibration guides and color profiles, I finally found one that is decent for games and movies. The problem is, in dark scenes (eg: space), the backlight makes the screen look grey instead of black. This monitor does not have a separate ""backlight"" dimmer control like others (that I could find)","Other Thoughts:The price is a bit much. LCD isn't a new technology and neither are 144 Hz monitors (I believe ASUS made the first one in 2012 with their VG278H) so I really had a hard time justifying the near $300 price tag.The 4 star rating is mainly because of the stuck pixel and the lack of a clear warranty. I realize many manufacturers say ""3 or less is acceptable"" but as a consumer I disagree. If I bought a 6-cylinder car and only 4 cylinders worked, I would not expect the manufacturer to say ""3 or more is acceptable"". Consumers have to let manufacturers know they expect better although they already have my money...",4,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Monitor!,2018-01-21,"Pros:Overall, the monitor is just great. It's heavy, clean, sleek, and the picture itself is fantastic. I usually play BF1, Destiny 2, Wolfenstein, PUBG, and Overwatch and this 144 Hz refresh rate is insane. I've never had a monitor like this before and I'm glad I got it.",Cons:Honestly I have nothing bad to say about the monitor itself. The internal native speakers are incredibly weak but that is irrelevant.,,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Jusr received,2018-01-13,"Pros:4 stars, due to the fact that this is the second time I had to write a review, first did not work! NewEgg work on your website! For the price, this is one outstanding monitor, cranked it to 144 mhz, old Nvidia card, it work well. Bright, had to use sunglasses till I made adjustments! Tried various modes, all worked well. I highly recommend this monitor.","Cons:Quick delivery from NJ to NE. 2 days! My new gaming PC, shipped from CA is on a scenic tour of the US! FedEx needs big time work! :(","Other Thoughts:Would I recommend this Monitor? Yes! best bang for the buck available! No dead pixels, everything worked as advertised. Buy this if you want a good 27 inch gaming monitor!",3,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor,2018-01-12,"Pros:Great for gaming and general production work. 144 Hz gives buttery smooth action. Height adjustment is a plus for all sorts of desk adjustments, and cable management hooks are great for hiding the clutter",Cons:No AMD Freesync,Other Thoughts:If you don't care about 4K or don't have a graphics card or the cash to support it this is an excellent choice.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,1,bad product never purchase this monitor,2018-01-11,Pros:- Good to throw away- Good to refund- Good to never buy,Cons:- Bought it and the screen was cracked on arrival- Made weird screeching noises- Got caught on fire,Other Thoughts:- Buy anything else but this monitor- Go buy a PlayStation 4 instead of a broken monitor- Go play on coolmathgames 60hz because 144hz is not relevant,3,131
ASUS,VG278Q,5,WOW,2018-01-11,"Pros:- Color(s) are vibrant & crisp- Graphics on AAA games look absolutely amazing.- It's big!- 144 Hz :)- DP / HDMI capable- Came with tons of cables!  (HDMI, Displayport, DVI, etc.)- Mountable!  (You'll need to remove the back plate or have longer screws if you want to keep in it)","Cons:- It's not 'ASUS ROG' branded, but it's good enough that it could've been.","Other Thoughts:- This is a TN panel, which is excellent for gaming.  Although some prefer IPS & some prefer VA (though you'll pay a pretty penny for the latter in many cases)- I didn't really pay much attention to the built-in speakers, as I have my own surround sound setup already.  It does add a little bit of thickness to the monitor, so if you like monitors with a slim profile... this might be a deal breaker.",4,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Zero Complaints, Awesome 1080p 144hz Monitor",2018-01-06,"Pros:- Reliable. Never had a problem, no dead pixels, obviously they happen... but not to me, and according to most reviews, not to most.- 144hz. My first 144hz monitor and I'll never go back.- I use the various modes constantly (well, really only ""standard"", ""gaming"", and ""nightview"". Nightview is awesome for browsing late at night with the lights off, and I even use it with games most of the time when in the dark ( you can also customize all of these modes, hence me keeping ""standard"" as my calibrated photo editing state and ""gaming"" as my 'look pretty for media' state.- Adjustable stand is fine","Cons:- Gets dirty?- Isn't 2K, the only reason I will replace this thing?- Speakers aren't satisfactory; they're not terrible but they're still built-in speakers on a flat monitor lol (barely a con. You should have good headphones or decent speakers by now)","Other Thoughts:- Like other reviewers, I've never used the 3D mode so can't comment- I wish I could get this exact monitor but a little bigger and 2K without going bankrupt",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great 144Hz monitor,2017-12-30,"Pros:This monitor is awesome. I don't use the inbuilt speakers or the 3D... But hey, everything else about it is 10/10. Very happy to make this purchase (twice). No dead pixels, easy to adjust height and assemble, no problems with the delivery either. Great for gaming.","Cons:- Honestly, I can't think of a bad thing about this. It is exactly what you expect if not better.",,3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2017-12-17,"Pros:Good build quality, lots of ports, nice mounting features, bright crisp picture with no noticeable lag or blur in FPS games","Cons:Speakers are awful, but you prolly didn't buy this monitor for the speakers",Other Thoughts:Got it on black friday for $180,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,awesome monitor,2017-12-07,"Pros:Only had this for a few weeks so far but loving it nonetheless. This is my first time playing on 144hz and it makes all the difference, it’s amazing. As other owners mentioned the default colors are a little bland at first but messing around with that can get you a colorful vibrant display, looks real nice. Overall I’m pleased",Cons:None so far,,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amzing monitor especially for games,2017-12-03,"Pros:- Excellent display quality (good color accuracy, brightness, and sharpness)- With this monitor's ""Trace free"" effect games will look completely different.  (very smooth and fast motion)- Cross-hair overlay allows you to ""cheat"" in video games that do not have a cross-hair or have it disabled.- The construction of this monitor is very heavy duty, it is clearly built to last.- I have had this monitor for more than 3 years with about 6 hours of use per day on average and it is still just like new.","Cons:- It would be nice if the stand could go a bit higher.- I didn't buy this with any intent of using the built in speaker, but for those of you who might be, don't.  My headphones can produce significantly superior sound at the same distance.",,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Night and Day difference.,2017-12-03,"Pros:I've spent the last little while upgrading parts of my PC. GPU here, SSD there, and recently transferred everything into a new build. Everything combined, I'm thrilled, but if I had to choose one item of my new set up, it would be this monitor.-Crystal clear display-Seeing things I've never seen before in games (can gauge depth better, players stand out against the background, colors more vibrant)-Allows me to see the frames my tower is capable of pumping out.-Adjusts, tilts, rotates effortlessly.","Cons:-Height adjustment doesn't seem to have a lock. While it takes some pressure to change elevation, once you press hard enough it drops all the way down to the base.-Speakers might as well have been removed. You can barely here anything 5 feet away on max volume (not that monitor speakers are all that important).","Other Thoughts:Don't skimp out on the monitor. If you're investing any money in a new rig, make sure you have a quality screen to match. Without that, you could be playing at 300 fps and have no discernible advantage over someone playing on a potato. Super happy with my purchase.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Luck of the draw,2017-11-28,Pros:Got this monitor 8 months ago and it has been flawless. Colors are great after calibrating.,"Cons:Purchased a second one for dual setup, but the new monitor has a yellowish tint.Same color settings and both using a display port cable (tried swapping cables, but issue remained).Called ASUS support and they said I may have received a faulty one and that I will need to have it exchanged with retailer.","Other Thoughts:Works great if you get a good one -- but if you're using only 1 of these and happen to receive a faulty one, it can be tricky as you might not know if its a faulty product or if you need to mess with the color settings. Super sad as I loved the first monitor.",0,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Near Perfect! :),2017-11-27,"Pros:Coming from an old crummy 19"" HP monitor this is amazing! Got this on sale for $240, and at that price, I can't complain. If this monitor goes on sale again and your considering getting it, click buy! :)- great specs- nice solid stand, can adjust height, tilt, swivel, and rotate! :)- good overall design","Cons:Nothing major, but there are some small improvements that ASUS can make.- The color/brightness settings out of the box aren't as many people have stated. It only takes a couple minutes of tweaking to make it look good. I have mine set to 20 brightness, 50 contrast, 50 saturation, and 60 sharpness.- After I set up my monitor I noticed a minor scratch on the stand, I probably damaged it while either unpacking or something. Luckily it's not very noticeable, but regardless, the glossy finish isn't ultra durable, so be careful. ;)","Other Thoughts:This is still only my first 'gaming' monitor, so I don't have much to compare it to.My Rig (will eventually upgrade gpu):NZXT M59MSI 970A-G43AMD FX 6350 (not OC'd)EVGA GTX 650Ti Boost 1GBG.SKILL Ripjaws X 2x4GB DDR3 1866Rosewill Performance 600WSo far no dead pixels or any problems.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,so far so good !,2017-11-26,"Pros:so far so good , you just have to tmper with the color ,the brightness and contrast a bit ,since everyone is different ! It's a big difference between a 19"" old lcd screen to this one !! I think for the price is a good monitor . I could visibly see the difference ! But like I said I have to change the brightness because is too strong for my eyes ! after 2 hours of usage this morning my eyes hurt ! It's more a get use with the new screen type of deal ! For now everything is good ,I hope it stays that way! UPDATE ,THIS WON'T WORK ON HIGHER REFRESH RATE ,YOU WILL GET A VISIBLE REFRESH LINE EVERY 10 MINUTES !!! IS ANNOYING ,DON'T BUY IT IF YOU HAVE GOOD HARDWARE TO BACK IT UP !","Cons:GOING TO 144 MHZ SCREEN FLICKERS EVERY 10 MINUTES , I HAVE TRIED WITH HDMI DVI PORT SAME THING ,IF YOU WANNA GAME AT HIGHER MHZ DON'T GET THIS ONE",,0,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Just bought it. Incomplete review,2017-11-26,Pros:got it for $309.   27 inch for almost same price as 24 inch.144hz,Cons:I still can't get color to look good.  I don't like the presets all that much.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor November 2017. I got it for 144hz to play multiplayer fps's.To be honest I don't think the image is any better than my Dell 2409 which is from 2009.I don't know if the color is considered any  good , to me I don't  think it does.",2,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,+3 years and still awesome,2017-11-23,"Pros:No dead pixels,  good size (anything wider bothers my eyes), bought it for $290.Super responsive which is nice because I play  a few games where adding  any kind of lag is a big disadvantage.Increasing from 60 to 120 Hz makes a noticeable difference,  everything is much smoother.","Cons:The colors looked weird to me  when I first got it.  I messed with the settings  for a long  time, but eventually I got used to  it and it  stopped bothering me.  I also found a setting that I liked:  sRBG.  I've left it on that setting  for at  least 2 years.","Other Thoughts:I was worried that the spring loaded friction fit adjustable height was going to  get too loose to  support itself but it's  just as good as the day I bought it.I messed around  with the strobe back-light feature when I first got it, but have since given up.  It helps with choppiness but also dims the screen.  In the end it was weird having a third party program turn my monitor into  a rave  for  a  little extra smoothness.I forgot  this thing had speakers... I've never used them...  lol.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,It works well,2017-11-22,Pros:It looks good. it is running 144 HZ refreshing rate on DVI mode that is what I want. 1ms responding time is perfect!,Cons:The HDMI connection can only run 60 HZ  but the DVI is running 144HZ. That means the DVI connection is faster than HDMI on this device.,"Other Thoughts:If the screen can be raised up more higher, then it would be much better.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,I loved this monitor but it died after a little under 2 years. Be wary.,2017-11-19,Pros:-This has really beautiful image and the fact that you can move it is really nice-Small bezel,Cons:- Burnt out after not using it for 6 months. Really odd.,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Not as good as my 5 year old ViewSonic,2017-11-13,"Pros:Physical design is very nice. I love the ability to quickly and easily adjust the height and angle of the monitor. Solid and sturdy construction, nice cable management slot in the middle of the stand, and good on-screen-controls. Also good price for the 27"" size.Comes with a DVI-to-DVI cable and a DisplayPort cable.","Cons:The first thing I noticed was a very splotchy back lighting, which was unmistakable when viewing a solid black screen (which would appear more as a dark grey with splotchiness, especially in the middle of the screen). I looked this up online and there were others who experienced the same issue. This wasn't very noticeable during normal display, but once I saw it, it became hard to unsee it.Overall display just looked bad. Jagged text, blurry image movement even when running at 144Hz with V-Sync enabled, bad contrast, and weird intermittent misregistration of colors (most noticeable on the minimap while playing Destiny 2, but also in just regular windows applications).","Other Thoughts:I really wanted to like this monitor, but after a solid week of use, mostly playing games on it, I had to throw in the towel when I went back to my old monitor and saw how much better everything looked on it... even though the old monitor was only 60Hz.Maybe I'm just picky, but for nearly $400, I feel I have the right to expect a much higher quality experience. I'm sticking with ViewSonic displays from now on.",6,26

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Stand is too small and unstable.,2017-10-28,Pros:- 144hz- 1080p- Display is pretty good- Lightboost support,"Cons:Well here's the thing about this monitor. The stand is much too small to fully support the top heavy nature of this monitor. It was always a bit wobbly from the beginning, but I thought it would be okay. I had no problems with the stand for almost a year until I decided to get on to play a game of CSGO like I do every day. I'm not quite sure what happened but all I did was AWP flick a guy and all of a sudden my monitor comes crashing down right on the display. It hit the corner of my keyboard which is made out of solid aluminum and now there is a little dent at the bottom of the display and there are giant colored stripes coming from the dent. The monitor is now completely unusable. This monitor is marketed as a GAMING monitor and yet it broke while gaming.",,0,17

This monitor has decent features, I'm glad it can be adjusted up and down, swivel and back and forth. They run my games at great frames with out without v-sync enabled.

Look it up on YouTube)-Buttons for Menu etc. are easily accessible with an easy to use on screen menu.,"Cons:-None at this time. I was cautious buying a 144Hz monitor at this price. I read all the reviews about dead pixels etc. But honestly mine was perfect-Not a deal breaker, but the ""cable management"" holder on the back really doesn't need to be there. I put my cable there at first but it didn't make a difference at all.","Other Thoughts:-I would definitely recommend this monitor for the gamer on a budget that has a rig capable of pushing up to 144Hz. The difference is there and has made my gaming more enjoyable.-I plan on buying this again and running a dual monitor setup.-You really can not beat this quality of a monitor at his price. I tried. The speakers are okay for YouTube but for gaming I use a headset. If you play, and don't use a headset, get one.-I have not tried using the 3D feature so no comment on that.-A side note. The box this comes in only says VG248 on it. I was thrown and wondered if there were more variations of this. After research, I discovered you have to look at the white label on the side of the box and it will tell you it is actually a VG248QE.",1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,3,After 2 years . . .,2017-05-30,"Pros:144 hz truly delivers the motion a console gamer can only dream about. As for the colors, sufficient but there's moderately higher priced monitors that put this monitor and other TN panels to shame.","Cons:Purchased two of these monitors on October 2015. One arrived with faulty speakers but I was willing to put up with it since it still functioned fine, and didn't plan on using the built in speakers much. Now I wish that I took the time to RMA it because the DisplayPort on the very same monitor stopped receiving a signal. A rather concerning minority of the reviews have complained of quality control issues, but I was hoping to come out on the lucky side of the coin toss.Lesson learned and briefly put, if you're concerned with ensuring any monitor lasts longer than a couple years you must make sure to register the product with the manufacturer. Preferably, immediately on arrival. Secondly, if there's any issues upon arrival you must hold the manufacturer and  seller liable; because, it is most likely tell tale signs of things to come.","Other Thoughts:Solid frame rate, mediocre color, and spotty quality control leave me wishing I saved up a little bit more and invested my money elsewhere.",5,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,One of the best monitors I had,2017-05-12,Pros:- Awesome response- 144 Hz- One of the best monitors ever,Cons:- Small?,Other Thoughts:Buy this if you are searching for a 144 hz monitor to play games.,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"From 60hz and 10ms to 120hz*** and 1ms, I am amazed.",2017-04-26,"Pros:- Very little ""blurr"" when moving my screen. When scrolling up and down with text on a white background with black letters, everything remains clear.  I can actually read while scrolling now.- Easy to install.  Just attach the bottom mount with a bolt (no tools needed), plug it in and I was done.-Color looks great with very little time spent in the on screen display.  (I'm using theater mode, contrast at 75, saturation 46, color temp user at R:98, G:95, B:93), skin tone natural, sharpness 40, trace free 80, and of course, brightness is based on your rooms lighting.- You can still see detailed textures in games while moving the screen, fast moving objects can be tracked.  It not only looks great, but makes it easier to track the many things that happen at once in games.- no dead pixels- Like almost every monitor, you need to adjust some settings in the on screen display to get the best picture, this one only took me about 10 minutes and there are amble guides online for this exact model. (Did not take long, that's why this is in pros)","Cons:- Maybe have some plastic tabs on the plastic wrap showing that there are physical buttons underneath.  They're hard to see (but very easy to feel and tell apart).  I spent a few minutes assuming it was DOA, thinking they where just touch sensitive.- The presets are called ""splendid"", some of them wont allow you to change certain settings.  Theater mode seems to have them all unlocked though.","Other Thoughts:- Use a measuring tap to get an idea of how big a monitor is before you buy it. The size you need depends on how close you sit to it. 24"" is surprisingly big from about 1 1/2' - 2' away.- Use the VGA cable that comes with it.  My HDMI cables (might be low quality, came with ps4) only allowed up to 85hz with some tearing on screen. This problem may also be my video card not supporting HDMI at 144hz. The included VGA cable lets me go all the way up to 144hz without having to use a custom setting in GeForce.***My gtx770 is not fast enough to use 144hz in some games. I'm using 120hz just fine with it and I'm still amazed with how clear finely detailed objects remain while I'm moving in game.  This review is based on that 120hz figure and I have not yet been able to use this monitor to it's fullest potential.",1,0

So I got a new RX470 and it worked for a  month and a half and the display port stopped working again. So I replaced the display port with an new one and still no display.

Sometimes unplugging the power cable and waiting a bit works to get it to work, sometimes its not enough and we have to go through this many times. This is quite annoying especially since both me and my girlfriend have these monitors and one of hers appears to be the only one with this issue.","Other Thoughts:- I do like these but if its too much of a pain to get many working ones together to have a full working set, not sure if its worth it.

You have to go into your settings and manually set the refresh rate to 144 hZ, but that's not a problem at all. The monitor is exceptional in quality, playing at a crisp 1080p resolution, and the high refresh rate makes videos and games play much more smoothly.","Cons:Unfortunately, I purchased this product for $259.99.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Much better than expected!,2016-12-20,"Pros:I was initially a little skeptical when I saw that this was a TN panel because of the notoriously bad viewing angles of them, but this one more than blew me away in that aspect. I honestly can see it fine with no discoloration from almost any angle. Since it's a TN panel, it has a quick response time too. Yes, the color isn't as vivid as an IPS display and color banding is pretty obvious in the right circumstances, but I'm not looking for photo realistic colors, I'm after high refresh rates and quick response times. Also, It says it's only 24"" but on the right desk, it looks huge! Over all, for the price, this is a must have if you want to move up from being locked at 60Hz at 1080p.A word of advice though: If you're going to be using this through DisplayPort, buy a VESA certified cord and NOTHING LESS! If the cord isn't certified, it could send tiny amounts of voltage into the output, potentially ruining your expensive GPU. I bought this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812607083 It doesn't say it on Newegg's product page, but if you search the exact same model number online (Accell B142C-010B-2) and do some reading, it says it's VESA certified.",Cons:The only thing i don't really like about it is the fact that they have the plastic on the back under the plate that holds the monitor rod to the back. I have yet to figure out how to remove the plate so i can seperate the screen from the rod to remove the rest of the plastic......mildly annoying to say the least.,"Other Thoughts:As stated before, I would recommend this to anyone looking to get higher than 60fps at 1080p but doesn't want to spend more than $300.

I referred to a professional online review that had some calibration settings and used those. The image still looked a bit bleached, but after being on for about half an hour, looked MUCH better- absolutely gorgeous image quality. The only issue I have with the review's recommended settings is that it called for the Trace Free to be max'd out at 100 (default is 60). I saw sever ghosting in-game and on webpage text like this.

If your still debating about IPS or TN well all I can say is this was worth every cent I paid for it.",Cons:.,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Much better than expected!,2016-12-20,"Pros:I was initially a little skeptical when I saw that this was a TN panel because of the notoriously bad viewing angles of them, but this one more than blew me away in that aspect. I honestly can see it fine with no discoloration from almost any angle. Since it's a TN panel, it has a quick response time too. Yes, the color isn't as vivid as an IPS display and color banding is pretty obvious in the right circumstances, but I'm not looking for photo realistic colors, I'm after high refresh rates and quick response times. Also, It says it's only 24"" but on the right desk, it looks huge! Over all, for the price, this is a must have if you want to move up from being locked at 60Hz at 1080p.A word of advice though: If you're going to be using this through DisplayPort, buy a VESA certified cord and NOTHING LESS! If the cord isn't certified, it could send tiny amounts of voltage into the output, potentially ruining your expensive GPU. I bought this one: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812607083 It doesn't say it on Newegg's product page, but if you search the exact same model number online (Accell B142C-010B-2) and do some reading, it says it's VESA certified.",Cons:The only thing i don't really like about it is the fact that they have the plastic on the back under the plate that holds the monitor rod to the back. I have yet to figure out how to remove the plate so i can seperate the screen from the rod to remove the rest of the plastic......mildly annoying to say the least.,"Other Thoughts:As stated before, I would recommend this to anyone looking to get higher than 60fps at 1080p but doesn't want to spend more than $300.

They initially said I had to pay for shipping as well. I complained, and after weeks was able to start an advance RMA. Contacting Asus is simply terrible!After weeks and weeks, I finally received a new display, but it had a panel defect right out of the box, so I had to send it back.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2016-11-10,"Pros:Everything the monitor promises, you get. I regret not writing a review for the product shortly after buying the thing 3 years ago. The fact that you can adjust the monitors height and tilt is great when you are like me and change positions multiple times in a gaming session. The colors are fantastic and if they aren't what you like out of the box then you can adjust them in the menus, everybody is different. I went from gaming on a 60 Hz monitor to this and it was like I had never gamed properly before. Screen tearing was eliminated and I could see things in games and during action packed scenes that I had never seen before. The fact that I could see these extra bits helped me immensely when it came to ""competitive"" or fast paced gaming.",Cons:The menus are a pain to navigate with the buttons on the monitor. If it came with a remote this con would not be here. Not worth knocking an egg off.,"Other Thoughts:-Haven't tested the speakers. (Honestly I would have rather they come without speakers to lower the cost. Nobody is buying this monitor and planning to use the speakers anyways.)-I'm not interested in 3D gaming so I also have no information on that.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great quality, one drawback.",2016-08-17,"Pros:With a Dual-Link DVI cable the 144hz refresh rate looks amazing! The adjustable stand is responsive to up and down adjustments, lateral pivoting doesn't slouch at all, so no need to worry about constantly adjusting the screen angle. The ultra-fast response time is fantastic for gaming, and when watching movies in widescreen there is absolutely no bleed into the black bars (which are seriously black, not grey at all) whatsoever. 3D readyness makes me happy and is definitely a plus for me.","Cons:ANTI-GLARE, I'm knocking off an egg for not giving us the option to choose between gloss or anti-glare. This may just be me, but when I'm looking for an immersive gaming experience, I shut off the lights around me, put on some headphones and get into the game, so having some anti-glare plastic sheet mucking up my monitor's clarity is a con. I have an old HP w1907 monitor with a glossy screen and I hardly ever noticed any glare, and when I compare it side-by-side with my ASUS 144hz monitor it makes me feel like a took a step backwards in clarity. Also, I downloaded an ICC Profile for the monitor's color because the stock color profile isn't great. I could've adjusted it manually, but I'm not great with those kinds of adjustments.UPDATE: Almost three years of constant use the screen developed one, yes just one, stuck pixel. It's in the lower-right corner, solid red, and has been there for as long as I can remember. Though the good thing is I almost never even notice it's there, and hey only one stuck pixel is pretty good for three years use.","Other Thoughts:The swivel part of the stand is a little stiff making it a little wonky to turn, but the height adjustment is really nice and the orientation feature is great when editing documents. I've never experienced any overheating or random shutdowns and the buttons are all nice mechanical (digital touch-buttons suck!) for good tactile response.I'm getting an NVIDIA 3D Vision set here soon, I'll review that option (if it does well I'll bring back that lost egg.) ;D",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great performance, good price",2016-07-09,Pros:Good edge on performance if you're looking into competitive gaming.Rotatable monitor helps for when you need to view/read documents in portrait orientation.4 years and still works great without a problem.,Cons:colour quality is lacking compared to other monitors within the same range.,"Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this monitor if you're looking to play competitive gaming and need the higher FPS/hz refresh rate, but without having to pay $700+ for the more expensive models.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,3,"Really Nice Monitor, But Not Without Issues",2016-07-07,Pros:-144 Hz is Amazing-Highly Adjustable-Cable Management out Back,Cons:-Speakers are terrible-Mine has 4 small bright horizontal lines across the screen-Glossy finish attracts loads of dust,"Other Thoughts:This is a really awesome monitor picture-wise. The screen size is perfect for me, and the 144 Hz refresh rate looks amazing. I could hardly believe my eyes the first time I played a game on this thing coming from a 60 Hz laptop screen. I really love the height and swivel adjustments. The tilt is a nice feature, although I doubt I'll ever use that. It has good connectivity out back. However I have a couple of gripes and one issue with this monitor. One is that the speakers are absolutely terrible. But honestly I completely expected this. I have to keep the volume on the monitor at 100, and my system volume at 90 just to be able to hear anything when I'm not using headphones. Obviously this problem is easily solved by external speakers or headphones. Another complaint is just the glossy finish attracts loads of dust. I live in a desert region, so there's no shortage of dust. Lastly, I'm sure it's just a problem with the monitor I received, but I noticed that there are these 4 tiny horizontal lines all the way across the upper middle part of the screen. They're extremely noticeable when displaying dark colors, because they are brighter than anything else. I would have given this monitor 5 eggs, but I'm really disappointed with these lines that are now going to bug me every time I'm looking at the monitor. But aside from that, great monitor.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing gaming monitor,2016-07-05,Pros:Bright screen. Great presets. 144hz. 1ms response. Stand is amazing,Cons:Not free,"Other Thoughts:This is an amazing monitor. I tried a 32"" monitor, but when your sitting less than 2' away it was too much. This monitor is the perfect size. Mine shipped with no dead pixels (as far as I can tell). I use this as my main with 2 22"" monitors on either side that are wall mounted. I was going to mount this one as well but the stand it comes with is simply amazing. Small footprint and many options for placement. When you game above 60 fps your view of what games can look like will change forever. I have a pretty beefy system so this monitor was the cherry on top of the sundae. I am going to be getting another one of these as $ permits and possible will end up with 3. Even if you don't game all the time I would still recommend this. Simply an amazing monitor by ASUS.After 7 Months of non stop use this monitor is still going strong with NO dead pixels. I cannot recommend this monitor enough!",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,OK unless you're flicker sensitive,2016-07-05,Pros:-1 ms and 144 Hz-Stylish look,"Cons:-Flickers as hell. Couldn't work more than 20 minutes on it, too painful for eyes. Switched to flicker free ViewSonic and love it-No G/Free Sync-Colors are off, would need to download color settings from internet","Other Thoughts:Free World of Tanks game code came with the monitor. Well, it's not free at all! Newegg charged me $40 for some dumb code I never asked for and never opened. After purchase, go to your account and check that ""free"" item is actually free.",2,1

I have also found watching media such as Netflix and sling quite enjoyable. this is an amazing monitor for the price",Cons:this monitor is designed for gaming the blacks and whites are not that great if you're doing photo editing or video editing. I don't necessarily consider this a con because it's designed for gaming. but if you do photo editing and video editing you're going to want a different monitor,"Other Thoughts:like I said Above This is a monitor that was designed for gaming. I have owned this monitor 3 years bang for the buck this is a no-brainer, and if I know someone is putting together a gaming rig and they have a graphics card for 1080p gaming I would not hesitate to recommend this",1,0

I bought three of them and could not use one for a week until I realized the issue.Take a few minutes to read knowledgable reviews, A couple of updates are needed to get a perfect picture.","Other Thoughts:If your looking for a sweet monitor with the refresh rate to handle gaming, this is it.Do not listen to the few that do not take the time to maximize results. I buy a processor, I download drivers and tweek it. I buy a gpu, i download drivers and tweek it. There is no difference with a monitor.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Solid Monitor,2016-06-25,"Pros:144hz, 1ms response time, 24"" Widescreen and fully adjustable stand.",Cons:DVI cable that is sent with the monitor is roughly 4 inches shorter.,"Other Thoughts:I switched back to Desktop based Pc gaming in 2013. From 2008-2013 i played from my couch with my TV being the monitor. In 2013 i bought a 24"" Asus monitor.When i went back to the desk i started playing FPS's again. Primary one i play is CSGO. Been doing so on my previous 60hz Asus monitor for nearly the past three years.On Wednesday i went to a local retailer and purchased this monitor (same retail price as here). Ive read people on reddit proclaim the difference (from 60hz to 144hz). I can confirm that the difference is vast! Its astonishing at how smooth the rendered frames are.",0,1

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Very Nice monitor,2016-06-14,"Pros:The monitor has beautiful picture quality, is easy to assemble, comes with all the necessary cords (except HDMI), has is easily tilted or swiveled, and can be moved to a portrait orientation.  Picture settings can be changed fairly easily, and there are five preset modes which are very easily selected.","Cons:The speakers are terrible, with low max volume and a tinny sound.  While changing the settings is fairly easy, the changes can't be saved, so if you use one of the presets, such as if you switch to game mode, then your regular settings will be lost.  It gets frustrating to have to redo my preferred settings every time I switch modes, since all the presets are bright.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Absolutely love my x3 Asus monitors,2016-06-10,Pros:I loved this monitor so much I bought a total of three of them. Perfect Gaming monitors. Built in speakers.,"Cons:Only con I personally have in the base of the monitor is quite large. Solution: Took off the base stands, and mounted all three of my Asus monitors VG248QE's on the wall.",,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,A Great First Monitor,2016-06-08,Pros:-True 144Hz refresh rate-1ms response time-Adjustable base stand-Features 3D altthough I have yet to try it-The most overlooked pro of them all: behind the display is an apparatus for neatly packing all your cables coming out of the back,Cons:-The speakers are almost nonexistent; not to mention they aren't in the front. The reason why people that design hardware hosting audio output don't orient the output from the front of the device is beyond my comprehension.-There is a mid to high frequency whine screaming out the back of my monitor when it needs to display more data. Unfortunately I noticed this a bit too late because I typically play with headphones on and my GPU coils also whine from time to time. It is without any doubt coming from the monitor though. The sound is so egregious I wanted to file a return report until I realized too much time had passed since I ordered.,Other Thoughts:This monitor offers the advertised resolution output and frame rate with a few well appreciated modular/ergonomic features thrown in. Whether I received a lemon after so many high reviews is for you to discern as another customer.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great monitor, I'm not good with titles",2016-06-05,"Pros:I've owned this monitor for at least three years now, and I have absolutely no complaints.  It has never done me wrong, and I use my monitor a LOT.  I'm on my computer or playing Xbox pretty much whenever I'm not at work, so it's had a lot of usage.  Pros for me personally would be the brand (Asus), 144 Hz, and 1ms response time.  The ability to tilt and move the monitor is really appreciated.  Again, reliability for my product has been outstanding.",Cons:Only 1920x1080 resolution?  I can't call that a con since that's what was common when the monitor was released.  I have no complaints.,"Other Thoughts:Anyone who is looking for a monitor with a 144 Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time who isn't set on 2k, this is likely your best bet for the price.  I would buy it again if something happened to my current one.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,As advertised and less.,2016-06-03,"Pros:144hz refresh rate, AFTER you install the software. which takes FOREVER to install.adjustability is optimized, just incase you wanna turn your setup upside down? i guess.One of the cheapest options for a 14hz monitor on the market.",Cons:can think of any atm,"Other Thoughts:Cheap but mine came with a chip in the screen.

ASUS,VG278Q,2,Worked for a while,2016-05-17,Pros:amazing monitor for the price,Cons:DisplayPort will stop working after a few months.. apparently this is a very common issue.. mine worked for 6 months and 1 morning it suddenly the DP wont work anymore.. now im stuck with the HDMI which kinda defeats the purpose of buying a 144Hz monitor. Would not recommend this monitor,,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2016-05-07,Pros:this thing is beast love it first real monitor i owned Ive owned it since November and  couldn't be more happier upgraded from a tv..lol but  ya its great,Cons:just the speakers aren't that loud  which i use a headset anyway but its not the worst just have to turn it  up a bit louder then normal with your sound on the monitor,Other Thoughts:yes would recommend,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great Product,2016-05-06,"Pros:Was a great upgrade from my 19"". First gaming monitor. Great colors, sleek look, good base. I don't use the built in speakers.","Cons:Product has a dead pixel near the upper left. Doesn't really bother me, I notice it was in awhile.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this product. I should have bought two of them at the $209 sale price.-1 egg for dead pixel,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Great monitor when it feels like working. Don't waste your money though,2016-05-01,Pros:The swivel is nice and the VESA mount capability is nice.,"Cons:DisplayPort is a nightmare, apparently if you use DP you're supposed to leave the monitor on 24/7 and turn off sleep mode in Windows.1 day you'll turn the monitor off and go to bed, then the next day you'll wake up, push the power button and nothing. You'll be troubleshooting this monitor more than you'll be having fun with it.","Other Thoughts:Would not recommend this monitor, should have bought a BenQ.I've had this monitor just over a year and since I've been using the DisplayPort, I've had nothing but problems and today with the power plugged in and no DP plugged in, the monitor wont even turn on....Steer clear of this monitor, buy a BenQ if you truly want 144hz",0,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Happy with my purchase,2016-04-30,"Pros:-have it hooked up to my pc and my xbox one.  both look great, 144 hz looks very smooth on the pc-beautiful picture, no issues, not much else to say-worth the price for sure","Cons:-only thing i can think of is that it would be nice if the monitor had a slimmer bevel for dual screening, but i could see the bevel in the pics so i knew what i was buying (more of a random thought than a con)","Other Thoughts:-i see some people complaining about the speakers, i haven't even used them.  who has a nice computer and a nice monitor, but then uses built-in speakers?  come on people",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Love 144hz 1ms but...,2016-04-29,Pros:-Nice stand-Bright panel(maybe too bright)-Good Gamers utilities(aim dot)-Price(maybe for a 144hz panel)-Excellent colors(for a 6bit+frc panel)-Very smooth,"Cons:-DEAD PIXEL!! I can't believe this. Just three weeks.Don't buy this monitor.-Just DVI cable, no DisplayPort Cable included-Need to be calibrated. At arrival it was too bright and colors didn't look well.-On GTA V there's some banding issues on sky due the 6-bit panel.","Other Thoughts:*(UPDATED)  Nope, I didn't recommend this monitor anymore.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Ignore the ""washed out color"" reviews",2016-04-29,"Pros:Beautiful, got it on sale $200, adjustable height, portrait / landscape, amazing monitor, very sturdy compared to my last monitor. People complain about the large 3D emblem on the bottom of the stand but who cares?",Cons:Minor tweaking to get beautiful colors but that's not enough of an issue (even for the tech stupid) to knock an egg off,"Other Thoughts:So, I really debated on rather I wanted to buy this monitor because so many people were talking about ""washed out color"". I'm not in graphic design or anything where color is vitally important but I don't want my shiny new monitor to look ugly either.I just searched my monitor model # and found a Reddit thread which links to the ICC Color Profile to download, tweak just a few minor settings (Brightness, contrast, RGB) and this monitor looks beautiful.I've only had it for about an hour but I love the thing. Waiting on my other parts to come before I start testing it out gaming wise and I'll update my review when that happens.UPDATE: Had this Monitor over a year now and could NOT be happier with this purchase. This is the best monitor I've ever purchased and want so badly to buy another one if I could afford it. I HIGHLY suggest this monitor to anyone. Could not recommend this enough.",3,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Must Have Monitor,2016-04-28,"Pros:- Seeing 144hz for the first time is absolutely beautiful. Gaming has never looked better, and using programs like Photoshop is amazing.- 1ms refresh rate allows you to see what you do as you do it. I have already seen a massive improvement of my skills in every game I play.- 1920 x 1080 Resolution allows sharp images and delivers the best images you can get from a monitor of this performance.- Monitor was easy to setup and use right out of the box. Stand pops on in seconds, and then it is just a matter of plug and play.- The ability to adjust this monitor is unmatched, with great height adjustment, pivot, and even the ability to flip the monitor into a portrait mode.","Cons:- This monitor comes with a DVI cable that will allow you to use the 144hz capability (HDMI can only transfer 60hz), when it should also come with a Displayport cable for those who prefer it.- Setting up the 144hz capability was a little trickier than most people would want to do, but I can say it was worth it in the end.- Glossy finish is a dust and fingerprint magnet. Wish it was a matte black or something that wouldn't attract so much unwanted debris.","Other Thoughts:This product was probably the best money I have put into my computer setup yet. I am already considering buying a second one because of how good it is. This monitor is absolutely stunning, and its performance-to-price is unmatched.

(hooked up to my ASUS ROG laptop, which is a little under powered for this monitor, so I had to turn down the trace to avoid heavy workload on my GPU (once I set it up correctly is working flawlessly and looks beautiful)- Very easy to set up and assemble- Got it on sale!!!!!","Cons:- Nothing so far... Working great and looking crystal clear and vibrant- For anyone saying the speakers are weak... well yeah, but who relies on monitor speakers anyways? They work fine for what they are.","Other Thoughts:I knew this monitor would be a little hard for my oldish laptop to handle, but It is a great platform for my future desktop build that Im currently working on. The 144hz is a great plateau for gaming. I have not pushed this to it's full capabilities yet and it still hasn't disappointed.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,amazing,2016-02-20,Pros:Simply amazing. I really don't see any issues with colors. I find the quick profile is adequate for whatever situation. I play cs:go on scenery or theater. However if you play on 64 tick server dont expect to dominate everyone. Actually you will be at a disadvantage because while your monitor produces over 300 fps only 64 will be registered on the server. As a result you will feel like enemies see you sooner and your hits don't register. The solution is to put it slightly above 64fps. Mine is set at 75hz and it's playable. But we all know cs:go sucks :) Otherwise 144hz makes any game smooth and fluid.,"Cons:Really none, boot time slow",,0,2

ASUS,VG278Q,1,"Follow up to old review, because you can't reply to a manufacture response",2016-02-17,Pros:- You can do another review after you delete the old one- You can lower egg rating if you gave too much before,Cons:- ASUS manufacture response is just for show since they know you can't put in another reply. I have email our dear friend justin 12 days ago and have not got a reply back yet.- My name triggers improper text,"Other Thoughts:***THE FOLLOWING IS MY ORIGINAL REVIEW WITH A RESPONSE***Pros:-Great refresh rate for games that support it-Great 1ms for those with special godly optical powers-Great standCons:-You can get lemons-I don't always use ASUS product support, but when I do, I am smashing my head into my keyboard.(feel free to skip or ready my story)Other Thoughts:I bought one of these monitors on 2014 black november. It felt great, looked great; it was bright. Maybe too bright as I had it next to my old budget AOC 5ms/60hz. Didn't think too much about that; for now I had planned to buy a second VG248QE in the near future.2015 black november: waited a long year to buy my second VG248QE to go with my EVGA GTX 970 FTW. I was excited like a little boy waiting for santa. But then ASUS told me santa wasn't real. When I set up the dual VG248QE side by side, the colors did not match! Remember I said the monitor looked too bright? well it turns out that was a big problem. When compared to the new VG248QE i just purchased, the whites were extra bright, and the colors were washed out. I thought to myself, how is this possible when its the same exact monitor? I went crazy trying to figure it out and fix it. Settings reset, custom calibrations, swapping the dvi output ports, use hdmi cables, use Display port cables, having one ""on"" at a time, take it to a friends computer with same graphic card. Nothing made a change in color for both monitors with default factory settings. So one of these had to be defective, but which one? I was in denial my older one was the defective one, but when I printed screen(screenshot saved as jpeg) for each monitor separately and view them on my phone, they looked exactly the same! the same colors as my new one.... i felt a big apple just crashed into my head, knocking my buttocks to the floor, remember how nasty red apple ale tasted. that taste is back in my mouth, after i accepted the fact i was using a defective monitor over a year that cost roughly $240.Went to ASUS customer support with my problem. After a good week I get a reply with no solution, but to only send it out to a repair facility. Desperate, I took that offer and since it was local, I neatly packed my old monitor in the factory box and dropped it off. they said it would take about a week, but it was actually faster, got it back in a couple of days. But guess what, they didn't give me back my factory box(don't judge, i liked it for transport), my base looked like it was swapped out with a really dirty one(really dirty), and worse of all the problem was not fixed! Color is still messed up. Emailed ASUS to complained and no replies. End of story, I just have to deal with what i got.You would think for this price for a monitor, you would not get any problem on this high end device and reputable(i believed) company, but you can. I DID NOT get what I paid for. If I wanted to gamble and pray for no lemons, I go to the card tables.ASUS Response:Dear S*L,  <-- (LOL)Hello, I would like to thank you for taking your time in writing this review.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"ASUS VG248QE Black 24""",2016-02-15,Pros:Love this Monitor.,"Cons:I don't like the fact it Came FedEx home Devilry,",Other Thoughts:I want to thank all those that took the time to answer my questions. I only relay play GW2 most of the time. This Monitor is amazing for that. I have an MSI R9 270X OC Gaming card and i just used the DVI Cable that came with it. Got 144htz and about 60 to 70 fps. A little tweaking on the coolers at first but when you get a new Monitor that happens. all in all a amazing Monitor.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2016-02-15,"Pros:Display Port is really nice when you move the monitor up and down because of the locking connector.  HDMI would wiggle out on it's own.  Love the adjustable base, very stable and not too difficult to move around, but stays where you want it to.  Refresh rate is great for gamin.  2 years of daily use with no issues.","Cons:Color is a little bland compared to my other asus monitor, but you get used to it.",,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,2,"Was nice, until 3 months in ...",2016-02-11,"Pros:Adjustable tilt/height adjustment, vibrant color",Cons:White line across the whole screen,"Other Thoughts:I purchased 2 of these for a dual monitor setup, as I wanted a 3D Vision compatible monitor.  I bought these when I bought all the parts to build my new PC.  I haven't had these monitors 3 months yet, and when I turned them on the other day, there is a thin white line across the entire screen on the first (main) monitor.It is very visible on anything over 60Hz. At 60Hz, it is almost impossible to see the line, but it is there.  That makes the monitorunusable at anything over 60Hz, and in 3D.The line is not present until the windows desktop appears. It's not visible when I turn it on with no video feed.  This is a real bummer.  My previous monitor from another manufacturer lasted me 6 years, and still worked fine in 2D and 3D with never a dead pixel.  I just wanted a pair of matching monitors, and that one was no longer manufactured.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2016-02-11,"Pros:Absolutely no regrets in getting this monitor. The 144hz refresh is night/day difference. I use my old monitor as a secondary screen and this one just blows it out of the water. It has so many customizing options. Great color, brightness, contrast, everything. The stand lets you move the monitor to any position you can think of. Raise/lower height, tilt, swivel, turn, etc. Non reflective screen makes viewing in bright light easy as well. This monitor is so adaptable. I am able to hook up my Xbox One through HDMI, and then output the audio to my speaker set through the audio output jack; then I have my PC hooked up through DVI with another 3.5mm audio cord going into the audio input on the monitor and that also goes through the output on the monitor to the same set of speakers! It's great. I don't have to switch audio inputs/outputs just to have my PC and Xbox both work with my speakers.","Cons:The only thing I could ask for would be 1440p or 4k, but you can't get 4k in 144hz at the moment. They do have a 1440p monitor, it's just more expensive.","Other Thoughts:Highly recommended. Unless you somehow get a bad apple with a dead/bad pixel, then you will not be disappointed with this monitor if you're looking for a 144hz 1080p option.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Running strong for 2 yrs now. Typical A+ Asus quality,2016-02-07,"Pros:Strong, stable adjustment144hz looks great",Cons:Speakers blow...

Worth the investment.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,love it!,2016-02-07,Pros:there are a lot of great points about this monitor it looks amazing if your a gamer this is for you.

ASUS,VG278Q,2,Heart Breaking Monitor,2016-02-02,Pros:-It's 1 MS-The stand looks great and is customizable-Works with NVIDIA 3D-144 hz,"Cons:I've messed with the colors and brightness and saturation with this monitor repeatedly.  I convinced myself that this monitor HAS to be better for the price I paid for it, even though the monitor next to it costs half the price. In reality I spent so long convincing myself this, that I am now stuck with a Monitor that is overly bright and is no where near any of the true colors.  No matter how much I tinker with it, I can't get the colors to look decent and I'm now upset with myself and especially this purchase.",Other Thoughts:Wish I could return it.,1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Wow,2016-01-30,Pros:beautiful,Cons:non that I have at the moment.,Other Thoughts:beautiful monitor. I never knew one could have such affect. noticed the difference as soon as I entered a game. I love the monitor just as much as my rig.,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great looking monitor, good specs, good price",2016-01-24,"Pros:-For $200 (on sale), this is probably one of the cheapest, non-4K 144Hz displays out there-The adjustability of this is pretty good. Height, rotation, and pitch all give a fair way (especially since I'm using this with other ASUS monitors.-The 350cd/m^2 brightness is fantastic. It puts all my other displays to shame (I thought they were fine but side-by-side, they look, not bad, but definitely worse)-The 80,000,000:1 contrast ratio is a load of nonsense as anyone who reads about dynamic contrast ratios know. Unfortunately, I had nothing to compare it to but they are still good. I could not find any static CR values.-The internal AC converter is always nice and therefore uses a standard electronics power plug.-The whole profile of the monitor isn't bulky at all and manageable.",Cons:-The DP port went out on me. Asus has not been helpful and issuing a RMA just for a port would cost me more than it's worth in time and money (luckily high-speed HDMI and dual link DVI are backups,"Other Thoughts:-I'd hate to say, but I do not really notice a difference with the 60Hz and 144Hz refresh rates, although I still have yet to do any real gaming on it (after 3 months)",1,2

ASUS,VG278Q,3,You get what you pay for,2016-01-22,Pros:144hz is very smooth in games that support it... of which there are very few144hz desktop experience is neat. everything moves and re-sizes so cleanlySeems solidly built.Stand and adjustments are great.,"Cons:Colors: they suck. After calibration (custom color profile and some osd menu tweaking) they are better, but still not good.Contrast: yuck. Calibration does little to help this. everything always seems to bright or too dark, too washed out or too muddy.1080p resolution: yes a i know it's a budget 144hz, but if you're on a budget you probably wont be pushing over 60 fps anyway.","Other Thoughts:144hz gaming is amazing... for a few hours. If you are on the fence choosing between this and, say, a 1440p or an IPS, ditch this monitor and go for the higher resolution or better colors instead. My other monitor is a 1440p IPS by LG and it is superior in every possible way (except the 144hz thing).",3,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,144Hz is a must,2016-01-21,Pros:-great for gaming-good colors once calibrated-the speakers were much better than i expected,Cons:-i don't have a ton of games that take advantage of it- i wish that the cables that come with it would have been longer,"Other Thoughts:i bought this monitor for competative gaming in games like csgo, ratz instagib, and rainbow six siege. i have not been disappointed. its a great performer, and makes the games feel very 1-to-1.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Dead Pixel,2016-01-21,Pros:The monitor was great itself there was nothing to really complain about,Cons:Dead pixel within 1 and half months of use. First noticed it playing an online game and hoped it wasnt what I thought it was. Turns out it was a dead pixel and now im hoping to get it replaced,,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great!,2016-01-20,Pros:-Rock-solid stand that is easy to adjust-good contrast and picture quality-reasonably priced for a high-end 144Hz monitor-physical menu buttons! not those awful capacitive touch buttons that never work properly.,"Cons:-the built in speakers weren't as bad as I was expecting, but weren't great either. Not tinny and horrible like some, but they have no bass at all. Better than nothing, but even a cheap set of speakers or some half-decent headphones would be much better.","Other Thoughts:-you'll probably want to play around in the menu to get all the settings just right, but it's beautiful monitor once you have it set up to your liking.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Absolutely amazing so far!,2016-01-19,"Pros:I've been using this monitor daily for about two weeks now and absolutely love it. The 144hz refresh rate makes gameplay so smooth, it looks incredible. I had previously only had monitors with the standard 60hz refresh rate and wanted to step it up a notch, very happy I did. Setup was a breeze - the base attaches to the neck and screws in via a hand screw which can be tightened further with a screwdriver, it took all of 5 minutes to have this thing un-boxed and plugged in. Everything pictured was included in the box and there did not seem to be any issues thus far regarding dead pixels. No surprises with this purchase, you know exactly what you're getting.",Cons:None so far.,"Other Thoughts:One thing that was interesting about the base to this monitor (which is a little difficult to explain) but the base spins freely making the monitor extremely easy to turn sideways and plug cables in without necessarily having to pick the thing up and turn the whole thing. Title says pivot adjustable (not going to lie, didn't really even consider this) but it was a pleasant surprise for something to simple. The arm attaching the monitor to the base practically glides up and down for easy adjustments. Overall the thing just feels extremely solid and well put together, absolutely no complaints thus far.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor VS competition,2016-01-18,Pros:Great response rate. Smooth viewing in motion. Great variety of settings at a decent price.,Cons:May need some configuration out of box to suit a users preference.,"Other Thoughts:So the unit does come out of the box with slightly high brightness settings but I don't personally mind that, some other users may be bothered by this. Otherwise the unit is simple hookup and config. Getting windows to recognize the driver file for the monitor requires that you point driver discover at the CD that came with the unit, which for advanced users is no problem but for newbies could be confusing.Absolutely great performance monitor for the price. I can really notice the difference with  my reactions against other players in FPS games, seeing the peek around the corner early and really getting those first few shots in before they fully clear the corner. Also tracking motion shots is way more fluid now.The built in crosshair function is kinda broken but is nice for those really trying to see how the weapon spray is certain FPS works.Worth every penny for the unit.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Nice monitor but quality ruined by 3 stuck pixels,2016-01-17,Pros:- The 144Hz feature looks nice but not with 3 green specks on the screen- probably the only good thing about this monitor,"Cons:- Monitor shipped with 3 dead pixels that did not work themselves out- All three are a green color and show clearly on a dark screen- seeing as how this is a recurring problem, asus needs to step up their game big time","Other Thoughts:I don't know why anyone would pay extra money for a monitor with stuck pixels, no",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Product blatantly lies to your face,2016-01-16,"Pros:1080p, great response time, great fps, nice adjustable stand.","Cons:Says clearly on the box it is ""g-sync ready"". What it actually means is that ""If you buy a $200 part which requires taking apart your entire monitor, removing 3 electric tapes, unplugging your video and audio internal cords, remove your existing board, throw it away (because what are you going to do with it, sell it to someone that wants a random spare video board?), break off a small part of the monitor so the replacement board will fit, and then put everything back together without breaking anything, and the tape you need to re-use holds... then it is g-sync ready."" Oh... and btw... the g-sync do it yourself kit you need? No longer made! This monitor couldn't be more ""ready"" for g-sync if saying the name g-sync made it spontaneously combust! Seriously, it is like saying your runner is ready for a marathon but he just needs legs!I wrote to asus complaining about this criminal level of false advertising and they just never responded.Considering it doesn't have g-sync the price point is way too high for what it offers.","Other Thoughts:Do not buy this monitor! You can get the same 1080p tech at much better pricepoints from companies that will not lie to your face. Also if you want g-sync... this monitor does not have it and can never have it installed as the part is discontinued. It is NOT g-sync ""ready"".",5,4
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great improvement over a 60hz monitor,2016-01-13,"Pros:I went from the 60hz 5 ms monitor to this one and there is a big difference in gameplay, would recommend this monitor to anybody who plays FPS games",Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:For the price of 259.00 it's worth every penny!,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,A must have for gamers!,2016-01-13,"Pros:- I was stunned by how smooth 144hz felt. It was an amazing experience, one every gamer should have.- The contrast ratio was better than I expected.- The stand is well built and easy to use.- AMAZING setup. No tools required, took less than five minutes for the monitor to be up and running.","Cons:- The menu screen navigation is far more difficult than it needs to be. I like being able to access the menu without looking at what I'm pressing, which was impossible with the complicated multi-functional buttons.- Needs to be color calibrated out of the box, which I expected, but wasn't pleased with.- The speakers are extremely quiet. My 2008 Mac Laptop was both louder, and better quality.","Other Thoughts:The Pros tremendously outweigh the Cons. At the end of the day, this is a fantastic monitor for gamers, coming in at a great price for the features included.I would recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy a 144hz experience, especially with multiple monitors.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Wasn't sure it would make a difference, then it did.",2016-01-11,Pros:- Bright- 144Hz- Fully adjustable- Price / Quality,Cons:- Takes a bit of tweaking to get the best colors out of the monitor. Then it again it's a lower end 144Hz.,Other Thoughts:- I was always on the fence about 144hz gaming. Bought this and I can't go back. I go over to a friends for LAN parties where I have a 60hz monitor and I can now CLEARLY see the difference.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,The best monitor I have used,2016-01-10,"Pros:Color Quality:This is one of my favorite qualities about this monitor. It has beautiful colors that are vibrant in any game you play. I had stopped in Anor Londo in Dark Souls just to look at the how amazing the game was able to be portrayed through this monitor. Even on maxed out settings in Fallout 4, this monitor picks up every color and light, boosting them and immersing you even deeper as you play.Cables and Ports:This monitor is able to support DVI and HDMI setups only, and that was fine by me. There are two HDMI ports, as well as a port for a headphones if necessary. It comes with a DVI cable and power cable, which helps with setting it up immediately after unboxing for all builds. The cables lengths are both average and for having everything set up on my desk, I didn’t need a whole lot of extra length on my cables. I am even able to have my Ps3 hooked up to the monitor to switch out whenever I want.Picture Quality:The wonderful part about gaming with this monitor is that I have never experienced screen tearing or any issues of the sort. It’s smooth gaming on every game I play. Works wonders on games like CSGO that require smooth frames at all times, and that’s thanks to the 144hz refresh rate. The 1080p is amazing as well and allows you to play games in fullscreen a lot easier.Button Layout/Menu:When I first started messing around with the menu to set everything up, it was a bit bothersome to work with. Sometimes you would be just trying to adjust the volume and accidentally change the color layout of the monitor. Then you would have to reset where you had it and then sort the the monitors menu to find where the volume was even at. I was confused for a bit, but after a few times it becomes easier to work with. I would say that is the only con I had when I first started using this monitor.Adjustable Stand:I love that I am able to turn the monitor around anyway I need it to go to suit my fancy. It’s never been hard to work with and you can easily adjust the angle it is sitting. I tend to watch shows while laying on my bed, so I can easily face the screen down a tad bit to view the screen more comfortably. You can even turn the screen 90 degrees if you want. I will say, that helps when moving the monitor and keeping it safe when you are moving.",Cons:The only issue I had was when working with the button menu.,Other Thoughts:I love this monitor and have been using it for quite sometime now. It works wonderfully and is by far the best I've used. I'd recommend ASUS monitors to anyone in all honesty. They are well worth every cent.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Wonderful monitor!,2016-01-10,"Pros:-I got this when it was 200 dollars and it was well worth that.-This monitor is much easier on my eyes because of many reasons, but a big improvement is that it has a separate calibration with text to make type more clear as well as display pictures.  For someone who writes and reads a lot, this is a must!-Worked once plugged in easily.-Power plug in the back stays put unlike my last monitor.-Being a gamer and upgrading from something much worse, the colors and animations in my usual games are just simply fantastic now.",Cons:-Takes a whole lot of calibration to get it all set up right if you aren't used to messing with your monitor settings.-Bigger than I thought it would be!,"Other Thoughts:I would certainly recommend this product to gamers and non-alike.  The colors are fantastic.  The response times really do make a huge difference in the smoothness of what you see.  Lastly, text is just so much more tolerable.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Excellent Monitor But Not Out Of The Box,2016-01-09,Pros:Looks nice.,Cons:The cables it came with did not support 144hz so I had to buy a displayport cable.,Other Thoughts:Will Purchase 2 more when possible.,0,1

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Huge difference from 60hz,2016-01-07,Pros:I came from a 60hz Acer 1920x1080 monitor that I have had and been using for around 3 years. Moving straight from that to this the color is amazing (I know about the color problems so this just goes to show the upgrade i got) and the 144hz is so phenomenal! Jumping straight into CSGO I can hold angles (Im an AWPer) a few millimeters off the wall instead of the usual 1cm or half an inch. It isn't reaction times i've slow on its the refresh rates!,Cons:Super glossy and prone to finger prints and marks and it has a sticky touch to it but i'm hoping this is just from the recent plastic I've taken off.,Other Thoughts:highly recommended even if it isn't on sale.,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Defective Monitor - Bad Power Supply?,2016-01-05,Pros:The monitor looked amazing and it was easy to set-up with convenient tilting/pivoting that I haven't seen before.  I thoroughly was impressed.,"Cons:Only THREE days after using this monitor, I came home after work and it would not turn on.  I thought possibly the outlet in the wall was faulty, or there was a loose connection.  I tried different power cords and outlets and other obvious possible fixes (in addition to ensuring 120V in the wall outlets).   I have never had an experience like this and am now left in a rut as the monitor it had replaced I had given away to a friend in another state that had visited for New Years.","Other Thoughts:I am extremely disappointed.  I had received this as my gift for Christmas from my girlfriend and I was relying on this for schoolwork.  Not only that, but I threw out the box as it was taking up a lot of space and I live in a small room for school and now have no way of returning this product since I don't have the original retail box.  I have filed a defective RMA  anyways but I doubt anything will come from it except for spending $25 to ship it to California just to have my replacement request denied and my defective monitor to be refurbished to send out to someone else. I recommend people be very wary of this severe issue.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor for the Price!,2016-01-05,Pros:-Great picture-Smooth gaming experience-Good prices-Adjustable height and angles-3 Year warranty-Has both HDMI and DVI for multiple imports (If you would like to plug in your console along side your pc as well),Cons:-Built in speakers aren't the greatest but it gets you by-Not too much other cons so far,Other Thoughts:-I would definitely recommend this monitor.

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Was a great monitor. Now bun-in.,2016-01-04,Pros:Fantastic GTGGreat contrast ratioLoads of great settings,"Cons:Minor issue: Early on when I got this monitor I had a problem with the power button. It would turn the monitor off but it smetimes wouldn't turn the monitor on. I don't know if it was a problem with the monitor itself or the video card not sending the right signal (yes, I'm not very technical) but I would have to unplug the monitor and replug it to power it on again.Major issue: Burn-in. Honestly I didn't realize LCD's could burn in like the old CRT monitors but this one can and very easily too. While the Microsoft taskbar is permanently burned into the screen (extremely noticeable playing full screen video or games) other windows such as the browser can burn-in in under a few hours.New behavior: Around the bezel is very bright like the backlighting is bleeding through. While this always did this to some minor degree it's very noticeable now and can be seen at all times *unless the screen is completely white* and if the screen is completely white then the burn in really shows. Ghosting of windows mark my entire screen.Wish most of these problems occurred right out of the box.","Other Thoughts:As much as I love ASUS products I had to give one egg. I was hoping to have this monitor for at least three years. Also, I'm not looking to RMA (not even sure I can after [over] a year) and being this monitor is no longer made I doubt I could.",3,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Black friday deal was worth it,2016-01-04,"Pros:Just about everything. If you didn't get this during the black friday deal, you missed out. Unless of course you already have something better. First time jumping from a 60hz monitor and I'll never go back. The difference in refresh rate is extremely noticeable and better on my eyes. I absolutely love everything about this monitor. From the flexibility in height and tilt adjustment, all the way down to the silly built in crosshairs and timer. Seriously, this monitor covers all the bases.","Cons:Only 2, and that's the headphone jack location and the speakers. The audio jack is located so far up in the back that I have to get off my lazy fatness and make my way behind the monitor to plug my headphones in. It's not really a big deal considering I have ports in the front of my tower as well, but still. And yes, like everyone is saying, the speakers do suck. Aside from this nonsense, the $209 for this monitor was well spent.","Other Thoughts:I didn't notice this when I sat the monitor into the base, but there's definitely a screw that locks the monitor in. Don't be an idiot like me, tighten that bad boy in. I almost had a stroke when my monitor plopped forward onto my keyboard while trying to plug my headphones into the back. Luckily for me, no damage was done.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,1/2 good 1/2 bad,2016-01-02,Pros:-Monitor looks great (when they work)-Good size-Was good price-Newegg has been helpful with the issues I've had with this product (as they have been with all other issues I've had),"Cons:I originally bought two of these, one came working the other came with a issue where the monitor fluttered and the colors were all messed up. I sent it back to replace it and when it got back to Newegg they refunded me my money because the screen is on back order. I bought two for a reason, I wanted both monitors to be the same, and for both to work! This is frustrating because its not Neweggs fault the monitor was defective, but it having been sold out for a month is just ridiculous and the price has gone up (I bought these for 209 a pop) and I am stuck with only one screen. Newegg isn't at fault for this either because how can they sell a product the manufacturer isn't supplying in a timely manner. I am debating on returning the second monitor and going with a company that I can buy two WORKING monitors from, and if they don't work it won't take over a month of waiting to get a replacement.","Other Thoughts:I would like to add that Newegg has been very understanding in this and has offered to do a price match because one came broken, but ASUS can't seem to actually supply Newegg with the monitors for this to happen. I have been a huge Asus fan for years now, but this is to long to wait.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Dead Pixel,2016-01-01,Pros:This is a great monitor the refresh rate is spectacular and the 144Hz really goes along with it very nice. The rotation or fine adjustments are very easy and overall this is great for games like CS:GO,Cons:It came with a dead pixel.... I still plays the same but the little dot in the middle of the screen can be distracting when you are playing,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"MARVELOUS, JUST MARVELOUS!",2015-12-30,"Pros:-Purchased for Sub $200.-144Hz, 1080p, 1ms response time!!!-Red and Black theme-Color is great with some calibration-Pivot adjust-Response time-The witcher 3 and Fallout 4 look awesome-Comes with a 3ft DVI cord! Use DVI or Displayport (which I use) for 144hz-Awesome, stylish, gaming, fun, unicorns!-Matte Screen with anti-reflective-cable management",Cons:-Built in speaks are meh but I didn't buy it for them-Glossy bezel and stand. Just a quick wiping should get rid of it-DVI cord is only 3ft.-Not much else and I am being critical here.,Other Thoughts:Highly recommend. I did a lot of research on monitors and finally settled on this one. One of the top 1080p monitors. With the recent Black Friday price drop to $209 and a promo from Newegg for 5% by using their mobile app I got this monitor for $199. It was a steal. Excellent. Very happy.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Terrible product! 2 have broken on me in 3 months time.,2015-12-27,Pros:- 144hz- Bright,Cons:- Color Sucks- Stuck Pixels (I've owned 2 different panels and it has happened to both)- Monitor Stand isn't the greatest. It takes forever to get the monitor level.- DisplayPort died on one of them-,"Other Thoughts:To tell you my story, I got one for my birthday (10/18/2015). It had a stuck pixel show up and I returned it (10/25/2015) to the store. I bought another monitor online (10/25/2015) and it had a stuck pixel appear in early December. Now the DisplayPort has gone out on the monitor! I have to use DVI now.",1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,1,"The greatest, before they ruined them.",2015-12-26,"Pros:I bought 3 of them in 2013. They were gorgeous, had fantastic colors, and 144hz was spectacular.",Cons:One day in early 2015 my sister cracked one. When I ordered a replacement it was tinted yellow! I RMA'd it figuring it was broken. when I received my second replacement it was also tinted yellow! They must have changed something in manufacturing to cause it because other people also complained about the tint.-Yellow tint-Unusable due to yellow tint.,Other Thoughts:I would only recommend it if you could find one manufactured in 2013.,2,4
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Azmazing Monitor!!,2015-12-23,Pros:-144hz is night and day if you are used to 60hz-Great quality with colors and brightness,Cons:Had problems using dual monitors with DisplayPort but that is most likely the GPU/Computer problems not this monitor.,Other Thoughts:Definitely would recommend this monitor for any gamers,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,144Hz is smooth as glass.,2015-12-23,"Pros:Wow, 144 hertz is great! You may not notice it unless you have a 60Hz monitor next to it. The mouse gliiiides smoothly across the screen (its painted more often) whereas the 60hz is a bit choppier. May seem insignificant but its NICE and CRISP. Great for gaming or workstation.VERY LIGHT. I took it off the stand to put up on a monitor desk mount, and it was light as a feather compared to one of my older Dell monitors!",Cons:BRIGHT!,"Other Thoughts:Good stuff, recommended by a graphics aficionado.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,"Sadly, I expect all of them to have Dead Pixels",2015-12-23,Pros:144hz monitors are always great,Cons:Monitor was shipped to me as a Cyber Monday deal for $209.99. It arrived with a dead pixel smack dab right in the middle of the screen.,"Other Thoughts:I expect anyone who ordered this monitor on Cyber Monday most likely got a defective monitor. I sent it back to Newegg for an exchange (expecting the same model but a new one without a dead pixel). It just so happens that Newegg CONVENIENTLY SOLD OUT of this monitor, so not only do I lose the amazing deal that I got on Cyber Monday I no longer have enough money to buy the monitor at the raised price. While I got the refund, I'm still jaded.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome!,2015-12-20,"Pros:The picture is beautiful. The size is perfect for my desktop. I'm glad I didn't spend twice as much getting a few more inches. The stand is great. It tilts, swivels, and has a lot of height adjustment all without any screws. Actually came with a DVI cable :)","Cons:It's bright, almost too bright, almost. I have the brightness set to 0 out of 100 and still white backgrounds like this Newegg review is a little hard on the eyes if the lights are too dim. This won't likely be a problem for most unless you play in the dark.","Other Thoughts:I already mentioned the adjustable stand and DVI cable but it bears repeating. I wish other manufactures would catch on that there is more to a monitor than resolution and refresh. I for one, don't want to buy a new monitor only to have to purchase a mount and a cable to make it work.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,"Huge upgrade from an HP2311x, however it came with 3 dead pixels.",2015-12-20,"Pros:Excellent display, very good contrast ratios and color reproduction (once you tune it with an ICC profile and with the manual settings). Everything is easier to see in games, especially in fast paced games like Battlefield 4 you can quickly spot an enemy and react quickly. Everything moves smoothly in the panel and the adjustment options for the screen are great, and first impressions of it were ""build quality"".","Cons:Unfortunately not everything was perfect. While browsing a page like facebook, I noticed a small dot in the left mid section of the screen, which seems to look like a speck of dust, I wipe it and it didn't come off. I run a dead pixel test and find two more of what appears to be a total of 3 dead pixels, two more in the taskbar section, which at first were not noticeable. Currently going through an RMA with newegg to get a replacement and hope the next one doesn't have this issue.","Other Thoughts:Other than the dead pixels, the monitor would be a 5 egg rating automatically because I really liked it. Hopefully the new replacement will solve this problem and by then I will change the rating to a 5.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Extremely frustrated by Newgg,2015-12-16,Pros:Great monitor overall. Had a dead pixel and had to return it though,Cons:When I returned it I had asked for a replacement but Newegg decided to give me a refund instead. The refund amount isn't even enough to buy a new one. If I had known they would pull a cheap move like this I would've never sent the monitor in. Extremely frustrated on why Newegg would do this.,Other Thoughts:It would be great if I could just get a working model instead of a refund...,6,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,perfect,2015-12-15,Pros:Arrived on time with no dead pixels. Has DisplayPort and 144hz. Loving the adjustable stand.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I would say I'm buying more soon but I'll be going for 1440,1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,2,,2015-12-13,Pros:Overall the monitor seemed pretty solid. Good picture and refresh rate.,"Cons:Received panel with a couple dead pixels in the center of the screen. I RMA'd the monitor, hopefully a replacement will be sent.",,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great monitor,2015-12-12,"Pros:-144Hz, never going back to 60hz gaming, or even just using programs like Photoshop and Illustrator made a HUGE difference and improvement.-On screen crosshair helps with games like CS:GO where some weapons remove the crosshair.-It has speakers but I haven't used them so I can't say how good they are.-Great TN panel, after some configuration it looked a lot better than it did out of the box.-Height adjustment, Pivot were nice to line it up next to my second monitor.","Cons:-Mine came with a slightly damaged DVI port so the first day I got it I couldnt' use 144hz and was locked to 60hz over HDMI. I fixed it by having the DVI cable plugged in a certain position where if I turn the monitor at all, green dots appear everywhere.-Glossy/ fingerprint magnet.-Hard to navigate menus.","Other Thoughts:Overall its an amazing monitor, I got it for 200$ with a sale and honestly it's the best thing you can add to your gaming setup. Killer price, killer features.It would've been amazing if they included a DisplayPort cable along with it.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2015-12-11,"Pros:144hz, 3D, enough screen adjustment to make anyone happy (you can actually turn it 90*), Supplied cable will allow 144hz setup,  I got this on sale, the value is prob unbeatable.","Cons:Cable plug ins are very low on the monitors backside and face down.  This makes cables stick out like a sore thumb if you raise the height of the monitor very much, on the the base column.  If possible I'd of deducted .5 egg for this.  As we cant do that, I left it at 5.","Other Thoughts:If you are unable to access the 144hz setting.  You are most likely...1. using a cable that will not allow 144hz. A DVI cable that has a full set of pins is what you need.  Any gaps in the pin set (the middle section) means failure to lift-off.  or2. have a card that wont support 144hz. or3. have a bad cable.  try using a diff cable, making sure it is the proper DVI version (full load of pins).",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome,2015-12-11,"Pros:144 hz is amazing, i use this mostly for FPS gaming and i could not ask for a better monitor. Even moving the mouse around the screen is silky smooth, could not imagine gaming on anything less after owning this. The brightness settings are easy to use so dimming the screen at night is no problem, which i good because the screen normally is very vivid with amazing colors.","Cons:The first monitor i ordered had 2 dead pixels, but returning the monitor and receiving a new one was quick and easy and i have had no problems since.",Other Thoughts:Would absolutely recommend this monitor for any persons hoping to get the most out of their PC gaming experience!

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Good Monitor,2015-12-11,"Pros:Everything about this monitor is great, really. Could go into needless specifics but it's a really solid 1080p monitor.",Cons:Small backlight bleed at the bottom of the screen.Not 1440p or above.,Other Thoughts:You get what you pay for. This was my first 144hz monitor and it took me a minute to realized I had the cable in the wrong port for 144hz. But after that it's been nothing but smooth frames.,0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Decent Monitor Strange Green Line On Screen (Vertically),2015-12-10,"Pros:Overall this monitor is great with the price,since this monitor has 144Hz and 3D capabilities. All else this is a very nice monitor to play FPS games.Also the 180 Swivel is also nice for turning the monitor.",Cons:I do not recommend using the in speakers as the sound quality is horrible. The monitor also tends to get dusty and picks up fingerprints really easily.,"Other Thoughts:When I got the monitor I runned some tests to see if there were no dead pixels,one thing was for sure i spotted a line vertically from the top of the monitor to the bottom of it. The line is a bright green color as it is only seen when letters are on top of it which distracts me very much as I thought I was going mad over something that could be returned but not worth the hassle.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,The Monitor itself? Great. Newegg? Not so much.,2015-12-09,"Pros:The monitor itself is great. The picture quality is outstanding, and for the price point of $210 on Black Friday it was a great deal.. But that's not how much I paid (see other thoughts).USING THE DISPLAY PORT CABLE the sound quality through the headphone jack is great","Cons:I'll stick to the product reviews in this section -Using the supplied headphone jack from computer to monitor, the headphone jack out supplied a lot of feedback, was actually unbearable after about 5 minutes.The speakers from the monitor itself is also fairly weak and poor quality, I wish they would have just made it cheaper and not even bothered with adding speakers.","Other Thoughts:The monitor itself I love it. I wouldn't have probably felt quite the same if the sound quality from the headphone out would have still sucked with the display port, but luckily it's good.Newegg on the other hand has been awful. Basically my monitor was processed, says it was taken to UPS and then nothing even happened. UPS and Newegg are both to blame. Both first off being near impossible to get ahold of. Hour + wait on the phone and through chat. Filed a claim and haven't hear anything thus far (although it's only been a week).And really didn't offer a way of rectifying the situation. This is the second computer I've put together through newegg and needless to say I won't be doing another with them with the other product issues I've had.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2015-12-09,Pros:BrightGood color,Cons:Non,Other Thoughts:Great monitor got it for 260$ and it went on sale for 210$ the next day asked newegg to price match game me gift card for remaining balance.

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Ditch the TN,2015-12-08,Pros:Response time...really won't see that much of a difference over a 5 ms monitor though,Cons:TN,Other Thoughts:Buy an IPS and see what you've been missing out on...you'll be blown away by vibrancy of the colors compared to TN's.

Might have to wait a while before I get my replacement.,"Other Thoughts:Maybe it'd be nice if I can get a new one shipped the other way so I wont have to wait 1 week for UPS to bring the old monitor back to the warehouse in CA, 2-5 days for them to check it, and another few days for a new one to be shipped back to me.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Amazing monitor for the price,2015-12-07,"Pros:All pixels are working and contrast is amazing!  144hz with the low response times makes everything clear and smooth, even in high action scenes!",Cons:Monitor looks terrible when first plugged in!  it's super bright and everything is washed out.  Took me a day of playing with the monitors settings plus downloading a few ICC profiles to get it acceptable but I can't help but think that there might be a way to make it look better.,Other Thoughts:After you set it up do a quick google search for ICC profiles for VG248QE and you'll find a lot of people in the same situation trying to get this monitor looking as good as it should.,0,0

Don't buy this monitor expecting good sound quality.","Other Thoughts:I like how the entire monitor can turn so easily.  its the best to plug in headphones.  no getting up and going behind your monitor, just a nice smooth turn of the screen and you have back access.",0,1

When i say slow i mean 2-3 seconds so no much at all, just not instant. Also the speakers are kinda quite but then again that is comparing them to a 5.1 surround setup. It can also be very easy to reset the custom settings back to the stock settings but the only bad thing about that is the brightness so be careful when modifying the settings after you get it just the way you want it.","Other Thoughts:Great monitor, would highly recommend.",0,0

I highly recommend this monitor especially if you can find it on sale.",Cons:I didn't order more than one while it on sale.,"Other Thoughts:In windows 10, you'll have to go into display properties and change the preset for the refresh rate from 60hz to 144hz. Some games also require you to set your monitor refresh rate.  If you are buying this for gaming, and running without vsync, you'll want to make sure you change those settings accordingly.",1,0

Even though yes, it doesn't suddenly make you the best player ever, it does improve your ability to see what's going on faster, and with the 1ms response time, reactions in game feel a lot more fluid versus a standard monitor with longer latency.People say the colors are washed out, maybe it's because I've never owned an IPS panel, but this monitor stands out next to my other TNs, definitely looks the best out of the others.","Cons:Absolutely none, if you are looking for 144hz this monitor has everything you are asking for.",,1,0

Everything you could ever want in a affordable monitor that still gives you performance all in one.I've seen the same games I play on 120-150 price range monitors and their is a rather noticable difference.  For anyone that does a lot of gaming I highly suggest spending the little extra and going with this monitor.  You won't regrett it.","Cons:The Down sideThe speakers...  I intentionally wanted a monitor that had performance that also had speakers.  I don't tend to use speakers as I play most things with headsets on, but I wanted the option if I wanted to.The speakers in this monitor are biuld deep into the monitor and pointed up.  Sounds comes out of small grets in the top of the monitor.  This gives the sound a very echoyness to it.  Which of course distorts the sound badly.Very disappointed in the quality of these speakers considering everything else about the monitor is fantastic.Not a deal breaker by any lenght, your not buying this monitor for its speakers.  Any serious need of speakers and you should also go with dedicated speakers over monitor speakers.  Just don't count on these speakers for much.I'm keeping the 5 star review dispite the speaker issues for reasons I outlined above.",,2,0

It was great until 2 weeks after I got it, when the Displayport input stopped working. I was really busy at the time, so like an idiot I put off sending it in. At that point Newegg refused to take it since it was purchased 32 days prior, so I sent it to Asus to have it fixed. All was good until 2 months later, when the Displayport input died again. I decided I wasn't going to deal with the return process again, so I started using Dual-link DVI. Now THAT input has died too. So now I have to send it in again. I love this monitor when it works, but it's just been a huge pain. From what I've heard inputs dying seems to be a somewhat common issue with Asus monitors.

This is my first time ever writing a review because I just don't feel like taking the time to do so. This was worth the time to tell you guys how incredible it is! I do use my computer for primarily online gaming. My last monitor (viewsonic) was decent for it's time, but I never really understood the true potential in a good monitor. The lighting was starting to give me issues so after looking into the VG248QE, I gave it a shot. The lighting is exquisite to say the least. This is my first 144hz monitor and really didn't expect to say much of a difference, if one at all. As far as gaming, it's ENTIRELY different. You literally feel like you're in the game.

I 100% recommend it to anyone!",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Dissapointed,2015-08-17,"Pros:Ok so I have been using a 21.5"" ASUS VH226H 2MS G2G LCD monitor (non LED backlight) for the past 7 years and that thing is the closest i have come to the color reproduction and performance of a CRT monitor. The colors were deep, the blacks were true BLACK (if i had a black wallpaper on that old monitor you would not be able to see where the monitor was in a dark room because the blacks were so deep and on point) and that monitor only required a small amount of backlight to achieve the perfect colors. In order to get similar colors on this new monitor i have to turn it up so bright it looks like i am facing the sun.Before you think i have a defective monitor just remember i have two and i know someone who owns it as well. So i know for a fact the monitors i am using are not defective. They both work as they are supposed to and they both come from different stores (one newegg and one from a store i cant type in the name of) so don't bother trying to discredit my review. I am quite tech savvy and i can confirm i am running in 144hz mode (it does make a noticable difference in games at least in terms of general perception)So in my mind my old asus monitor had 2ms response time right? And that monitor had NO motion blur or motion fuzziness at ALL on 60hz. In fact, the moving picture was so crisp on my old 2ms monitor that i could spin around the dragon in HEAVEN3D and it rendered in almost a BULB-like effect where it felt like i could reach into the monitor and grab it..So i figured in my mind that 1ms response time would be 50% faster to the point of being almost hyper-realisticly buttery smooth right?.. not only is this new monitor not smooth. But this monitor is legitimately fuzzy and actually prone to minor image ghosting.. Literally i paid $300 just to avoid this. Even as i scroll through text on web pages you see the black text update  against the white background and it looks distracting.I am like the master of OCD when it comes to image responsiveness. I strive for an almost realtime image. If you think its not possible to make an image any more responsive than this monitor you are dead wrong. It is possible for displays to be completely blur-free and i have seen many of them. Just look at an of the new tablets or many of todays smartphones for example. You can play any 3D game and turn the camera really fast and the image will retain PERFECT clarity even rendering 2048x2048 resolution at 60fps. This monitor suffers from very fuzzy motion. Fact.","Cons:Whenever i test out a new monitor or new TV i do a simple test to check for response time, i strafe left or right in any HD first person shooter game and i observe the image to see if it loses any clarity. if it loses minor clarity its ok. If you literally see colors change as a result of the pixels blending together that is BAD. If you stand still in BF4 for example everything looks incredibly crisp than you strafe left or right everything looks like it just got 4X FXAA enabled on it for a second. This monitor simply blurs from motion and becomes sharp again once you stop. Its actually so bad there is almost a vignetting effect around the corners of the monitor.But i kid you not.. Besides that.. This monitor is the most wishy washy, oversaturated, overly-backlit bleached looking putrid monitor i have seen in the last 7 years hands down. There is no way you could call this thing a monitor. The colors look like cotton candy with a back-light so strong it just completely bleaches all the colors. It's more like an HDTV than a computer monitor. And Right now as i look at this monitor the center is white, the top right corners are yellow, the windows background (which i remember being a dark blue on my last monitor) looks like transparent washed out blue chalk. Its just not a very even or quality monitor.On my old asus VH226H i dont think i adjusted the gamma,contrast,brightness once in the last 5yrs.. All games just work perfectly. Never in my life have i had to adjust gamma through my video control panel and i see asus responding to all these reviews suggesting to do so? Uhh i think not. I have been through dozens of monitors and they can all be calibrated directly without having to make display driver adjustments.On my old monitor i used to use reshade and force ambient occlusion in many games and it looked amazing. With this monitor its just so wishy-washy i dont even use sweetFX because games simply do not look good at all. They look so.. flat. I cant even see the ambient occlusion effects honestly. Its like no matter what the backlight is dominant first over the color reproduction leading to washy picture quality.I will upload the video to youtube (google scalz420) of the numerous nit-picky issues with this monitor",Other Thoughts:The speakers are quite insulting to me as an asus customer considering my $170 cheaper (and better) asus monitor has better built in speakers.,1,14
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing for competitive gaming!,2015-08-13,Pros:144Hz is amazing in games like CS: GO and League of Legends.Lots of customization for colors and lighting.Splendid allows you to switch quickly between multiple lighting and color modes.Adjusts to fit literally any seat height or angle!,Cons:My desk is a little to small XD,Other Thoughts:Cool 3D logo on the base adds extra style points and the light that shows the monitor is on is on the bottom right edge so it doesn't shine super bright at night.,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Sleek and high quality,2015-08-07,"Pros:Pros:*144hz is awesome. it's even nice on games that I can't maintain 144 frames a second.*You can rotate it, move it up or down quite a bit; highly flexible.*Looks cool*Not at all flimsy; well built","Cons:I bought this monitor over an acer counterpart largely because of the timer and crosshair built in functions. the acer one was about 50 bucks cheaper. at this point I wish I had bought that one because the crosshairs aren't so great; there are only 4 options and they're all very bulky and ugly looking. they block too much of the screen to be useful. I thought I would be able to set custom times for the timer. I play battlefield 4 and fly jets a lot so I wanted to set a timer for 90 seconds (jet respawn time) and use it whenever my jet blew up. unfortunately I can't set my own timer I can only use the preset times, so when I did use it I set it for 90 minutes and then just did subtraction. the problem is that subtraction is annoying and a waste of time, so now I just use an old watch. quite sad that these two features weren't fleshed out more; if customizable they would be amazing.p.s. also, it's annoying to have to use the buttons on the monitor to set the crosshair and timer up but I understand the technical limitations I suppose","Other Thoughts:144hz is amazing, whether or not you choose this one doesn't matter so much, just buy a 144hz monitor!",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2015-08-03,Pros:- 144 Refresh Rate.- 1 ms GTG.- Adjustable stand.,Cons:- No G-Sync.- Washed out colors (read below).,"Other Thoughts:I've only used 60 hertz monitors for the past couple of years and have come to accept screen tearing and the occasional noticeable input lag. Then I decided to try out a higher refresh rate since I've seen the debates of 60 Hz vs 120 Hz vs 144 Hz. I spent a while looking at the different monitors (VG248QE against a few of the BenQ ones). I decided to get the VG248QE just due to the price and that I've had mostly positive interactions with Asus. The first I noticed when I enabled 144 Hz was the lack of or negligible tearing and skipping of objects on the screen in gaming or moving items on the desktop. Everything felt fluid and very responsive. The colors didn't wow me since I'm coming from an IPS panel and this was expected. However I did some looking around and found a few color profiles and after a few tries I managed to get a profile that I was content with and I haven't looked back since.Honestly, once you leave 60 Hz for 120 Hz or even 144 Hz, you can't go back.Also a bit sad that this monitor didn't have G-Sync, but there was a DIY kit that they had, but has been discontinued for a while now so not much I can do about that. But again with 144 Hz, I don't really see the stutters so it's not a deal breaker for me.",0,0

I have had the monitor for 45 days and a pixel died in that timeframe. NEWEGG won't take take it back because it is more than the standard 30 days (not bashing just explaining, I always love NEWEGG).Per ASUS warrenty information online they say the 1-5 dead pixels is acceptable within the first year (link below)http://www.asus.com/us/Monitors_Projectors/VG248QE/HelpDesk_Warranty/",Other Thoughts:Just my opinion but for a $300 monitor to have 1-5 pixels die per year as acceptable is kinda questionable.I typically go with ASUS. Most of my other monitors are ASUS and all of my laptops have been with ASUS. Never new about the dead pixel policy.,5,5

I will tell you how I calibrated it in other thoughts and this monitor colors are very good ( but not the best)  if you have a spyder5 calibration tool!Obviously the speakers will not impress but that's easy to workaround.","Other Thoughts:I highly recommend this, especially if your on a budget of some kind.It is a extremely fast smooth gaming monitor.(with a displayport cord/nvidia card).

ASUS,VG278Q,3,Good Monitor / Poor Customer Service,2015-06-26,Pros:Beautiful PictureGreat Stand,Cons:Horrible RMA,Other Thoughts:If you ever have to send this monitor in for repair you will need to remove the stand. It doesn't look like it comes off. I sent my monitor in for repair and  when it came back it didn't have the hardware to reattach the stand to the monitor and the monitor to the stand.

With basic Googling of the monitor's model you can find a color profile that will nearly install itself that corrects the ""washed out"" look.It has been over six months, the monitor has no dead pixels, looks fantastic, and is still running strongly.This is the monitor I point fellow gamers to when they're looking for a new setup and want to get into the higher refresh rates.It is worth the time to follow the various guides for setting a new profile and altering a few on-board settings like brightness.Well worth the money, and I will be buying another two for my main rig, and one more for my backup rig.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amurzing,2015-06-24,"Pros:Beautiful, vibrant colors. Movies/tv looks great on it.MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR GAMERS:-runs 144hz for csgo which makes a huge difference on how fast you see the enemy (wasn't a believer at first, now I am)-easy to set to 144hz with Nvidia software or through windows-very easy to set up, adjust, and has a added little wiring organizer behind the monitor.-3D (never used yet but it has it)-1ms (again, essential for games)Conclusion: I had a 24"" 60hz before and though it was fine until I heard the hype about 120hz and 144hz. Didn't believe at first, but it's extremely easy to see the difference in game. It's much smoother and responsive. Couldn't be happier at the moment.","Cons:Not a con but be weary that you need at least 144fps in games to fully utilize the 144hz of this monitor.Also, my GTX770 adapters are both blue so I thought I couldn't connect at first, but then I tried the bottom one and was quite relieved lol.","Other Thoughts:If you want a gaming monitor for high level play of any fps/reflex game where milliseconds count, you need this monitor.",3,1

Many built-in features for tweaking the image quality.Colors are vivid, contrasts extensive. Plenty bright. Very quick refresh rate with an amazing pixel response time. No tearing, ghosting, etc, even with fast action scenes.","Cons:Targeted more toward the enthusiast crowd, as reflected in the price point. Make sure to have a PC with hardware capable of driving your programs, it is hard to see the difference this monitor makes if your pc can't run things at high frame rates on higher image quality settings.","Other Thoughts:I hooked this thing up as a dual monitor alongside an older 32"" HDTV that was doing good duty as a pc screen. Even just in moving the mouse pointer back and forth between the screens, I could see a dramatic change in the smoothness and clarity. Didn't take long for me to order a second one, and now I just run dual setup of these high refresh monitors.I have not tested the 3D, and I don't use the built-in speakers, so I can't comment on either of those.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Poorly Packaged,2015-06-11,Pros:Excellent Specifications All Around.,"Cons:I have shopped at New Egg for close to ten years and have never had a single problem like this before, so that goes to shows the high quality of New egg.The Problem:The Monitor didn't come in a standard cardboard box. It was sent in the ASUS Monitor box. The box arrived having several dents and has a deep hole on the side. So when I came home I saw that a monitor box was sitting on my steps in open sight of everyone in my NY neighborhood. o_OI really hope it doesn't have any issues or defects (as a result of the packing) because I really don't want to go through the whole exchange process.I'm definitely a fair person, so I'll change this review after a week with the monitor.

Than this is your monitor.When I play BF4 on my tv I was getting owned.Switched to this and my k/d jumped up to a 1.67, in GTA if someone isn't hacking I can drop them. This is a great first person shooter monitor of if you are playing a racing game. Any thing fast pace this is for you! I'm about to get star citizen my clan mates wont know what hit them. lol","Cons:Well, this monitors color does suck for video editing or photoshop work. Yes you can fix the color's, but it still wont be a good choice for someone who need perfect color.","Other Thoughts:I love the monitor because I use it for fast pace games, for someone who doesn't care about high refresh rates and prefer beautiful colors this isn't for them.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Great Monitor except for buzzing,2015-06-01,"Pros:Great picture, great look.",Cons:Terribly annoying buzzing sound when I'm playing a game or using the mouse scroll button to browse a webpage.,Other Thoughts:Would be a 5 egg monitor if it wasn't for the terrible buzzing.,2,2

I wish it had at least one more hdmi input.,"Other Thoughts:Not so much a con but the controls for adjusting the brightness/volume and other settings took a little bit to get used too. My over all thoughts on this monitor after playing FPS on it, I would have to say that I really enjoy it. So far I have had no problems with the monitor. I would recommend this for any one that wants a good gaming monitor but isn't looking to spend $500.00+ on one.",0,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing Monitor,2015-05-29,Pros:Everything! Looks great. Played GTA V in first person with this monitor. Accidentally drove off a cliff and on instinct physically ducked as if I was in the car. I've never done that before. I barely use my TV anymore since this looks better!,Cons:Unplugging a locking Displayport cord is a pain. Tight quarters there for sure.,Other Thoughts:Couldn't be happier with this monitor!,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"A tough first day, day 2 is just what I had hoped for",2015-05-29,"Pros:I've been researching monitors for 3 months now because I wanted a secondary screen to accompany my professional 2K IPS configuration but wasn't sure exactly what it was that I needed. With the variety of monitor options for different needs and thanks to so much user testimonies I believe that narrowing my search down to this particular monitor was the perfect addition I didn't know I needed. My need criteria:(1) something fast for gaming  (to break from the world of editing I am usually working in)(2) something with 3D capabilities (always wanted a 3D TV but could never justify replacing my existing HDTV)(3) something that would perform dependably out of the box.The added DVI-D port was bonus because my particular GTX 970 card was already using the last DisplayPortI feel the screen I truly wanted simply did not exist yet. (4K, 120Hz minimum, 27"" minimum) This VG248QE appears that it will hold me over just fine. I'm not quite ready to go SLI quite yet... (I've already dropped a few thousand already on my latest gaming splurges!)Since I work/play in a dark office, the brightness on this badboy had to be knocked down to 20/100 as any other setting just irritated me to no end. That meant the contrast had to go up to 100/100. I've also used a professional screen calibrator, though I didn't notice a major need for it initially since stock settings appeared fine and color accuracy to me in-game isn't critical.Initially, 2D setup was fairly painless. My real stresses came when trying to get 3D working (using nVidia 3D vision). My monitor was constantly auto-switching refresh rates and this would cause games to crash right off the bat (or auto-switch to 2D). I thought I'd never see 3D apart from the nVidia logo demo. I was ready to return the screen until I determined that the monitor was just fine, the culprit was my UPS battery that my computer was powered by. The screen wasn't even plugged into the UPS. Have no idea the correlation here, but if anyone's refresh rates are wildly self-adjusting then that is a possible reason. (bizarre, I know). Anyways, plugged the PC into a power bar and that got resolved.I picked up several 3D blu-ray movies that I've always wanted to own - though I thought I was going to have to return them all - I could not get them to play with powerDVD at all. The lightbulb went off in my head and I realized that the screen needed to be manually set to 120hz in order for powerDVD to properly play the movies. Worked like a charm. So looks like I can keep my movies, my screen, and my 3D vision system after. Games look GREAT, they don't crash anymore, movies look great. I'll be buying more glasses. I'm a happy camper.As for 2D gaming, I didn't notice a significant difference in farCry4. A little more fluid. Nothing overly dramatic.Sorry for the long review. I could not get any help from google on my issues. Thought I'd share my experience here for anyone else that might be experiencing similar woes.","Cons:Not a con, I just found the monitor to be a bit more advanced to learn compared to the simple monitors I'm accustomed to. Software configuration can be a bit tricky when talking to this screen, and getting the proper answers hasn't been as easy as a simple google search this time around.","Other Thoughts:Coupled with 3D vision glasses, this monitor provides exciting experiences to old 2D entertainment. I was a bit hesitant to spend so much as I did own the Vision Version ONE system many years ago and it was a major disappointment. This time around I can say they got the technology right. This monitor is worth the investment into this technology, even with VR right around the corner.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Price+Quality=Win,2015-05-27,"Pros:PriceQualityHow it rotates and all that good stuff.Built-in Crosshair for FPS fanatics, like using a scout in CSGO is awesome with this feature.","Cons:None man, I like this.",Other Thoughts:I wish there it could rotate 360 degrees all the way.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Asus VG248QE,2015-05-23,"Pros:Extremely low (visibly non-existent) refresh rate, incredibly deep color scale, surprisingly wide viewing angle.",Cons:Doesn't support G-sync?...however after having done further research that may not be such a big deal.,"Other Thoughts:Superb monitor. Not the absolute best, but definitely upper tier. I've compared this monitor to an IPS panel made within a year of this monitor and, to my eyes, this monitor's color palette is superior. I can easily distinguish different black hues and dark objects against black backgrounds. Bleeding is non-existent. Out of the box the blues are a little intense but that's easily adjustable.The refresh rate (provided you have a meaty enough GPU behind the monitor) makes gimmicky-ish features like G-sync and AMD's variant unnecessary. No ghosting on this panel ever. Playing Dying Light at 152 FPS on this monitor is candy for your occulars, to say the least.Viewing angle is perfectly acceptable and wider than I thought it'd be. Can't speak for the built-in speakers as I haven't used them and probably never will.Very happy with it and equally happy I didn't get an Asus ROG with G-sync. It sounds like G-sync and it's ilk are more problems than they're worth.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,How have I played at 60Hz this whole time?,2015-05-20,"Pros:The packaging on this was very solid, the monitor arrived without any cuts or bruises, plug-n-play out of the box. After unboxing the monitor, you'll find the stand beneath it. After putting the two together, your installation is complete and you're left with a sexy, sleek, and sturdy monitor. This thing is NOT going to fall over or wobble when you type, it ain't going nowhere.If you've been playing PC games for even a few months you will notice the -immediate- difference this monitor makes. Right after setting my monitor to 144Hz, moving the mouse mesmerized me like cavemen would have been mesmerized by fire.Games are something else. Fluid motion makes for an excellent playing experience, and this monitor delivers silky smooth motion playback and never stops. I cannot fathom going back to 60Hz, it is impossible.","Cons:Once you go 144Hz, you never go back.","Other Thoughts:Make sure to use the DVI cable provided in the box.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,60FPS < 144FPS,2015-05-08,Pros:+ Beyond silky smooth refresh rate+ Great stand easy to rotate/pivot/raise/lower+ Not as wobbly as other similar stands,Cons:- Makes 60FPS look choppy after operating at 144 FPS for a while. You can't go back.- Now I want 2 more of these so I can have 144fps surround...,"Other Thoughts:Joking aside, for those who are able to discern 60 fps over 30, there is a great chance you'll be able to enjoy 144 fps in all it's glory. I'm not a pro shooter player, but I've seen my K/D ratio go from 0.5 to ~1.0+ since I started playing at 144 fps. Words can't describe the joy of  the increase frames.

Even while in desktop a 60Hz Monitor will seem ""laggy"" after using the VG24QE.Though it is certainly not close to IPS or PLS standards in terms of color or viewing angles, it does sport a very high contrast.Also I the stand is exceptional and capable any standard position.",Cons:TN Panels.  What can i say that we have not heard many times already.Color banding is quite apparent in almost any picture or movie.Glossy finish on bezel and stand ...everywhere.  Try not to touch if finger prints are bothersome.,Other Thoughts:well if you don't like the drawbacks of a TN panel then you most likely would not be considering this Monitor.Not the worst TN but not the best either.Note: i did get this from newegg.ca on my sisters credit card.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Glorious,2015-04-06,"Pros:easy setup, smooth motion, highly adjustable, Glorious 3d gaming.",Cons:screen rotation can be finicky to setup at first.factory color setup is overly bright and washed out( Internet has better setting but you need to press buttons on the monitor),,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent gaming and video monitor,2015-04-06,"Pros:This monitor is unsurpassed in its price range. Picture is crystal clear, response time of 1ms was instantly noticeable to me after a lifetime of gaming on monitors with response times in the 10ms range. Several color and picture modes are accessible with a single button press, the on-screen crosshair and timer features are nifty and best of all (for me personally) the stand is very solidly constructed. The monitor rotates, tilts and spins smoothly, stays in the position you put it in, and the adjustment mechanisms feel solid, unlike so many monitors I've had that feel like the slightest pressure will make something snap.",Cons:No major cons. My few very nit-picky complaints include a menu system that is a little clunky to navigate with the physical buttons and a few of the pre-set color settings appearing a little too heavily saturated. None of this monitor's shortcomings are even close to bad enough to make me consider giving it a lower rating.,"Other Thoughts:If you're on the fence and this monitor is under $350, buy it.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best monitor for gaming!,2015-04-06,"Pros:This monitor is hands-down the best you possibly get for gaming under $300. I'm not gonna use 1,000,000 characters talking about every technical aspect of this ASUS monitor like other people. This is a gaming monitor, so I'm just simply going to give you the reasons why it will suit your gaming needs:- 24 inches is the perfect size for gaming, IMHO.- The 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time is amazing. If you've got someone telling you that those things don't matter, there's a 99% chance that they've probably never even used a 144Hz monitor. It makes camera movements and moving objects in games way more smooth-looking. High refresh rate/response time monitors can make the win/lose difference, I promise you that.-The ways you can tilt and turn this monitor is great. It doesn't matter how tall you or your desk is, you'll always be able to get the perfect viewing angle.-Once you get the colors, brightness and contrast calibrated properly, the screen looks great! Next-gen games like FarCry 4 look beautiful on it.-The power supply is built into the monitor, so there's no bulky power brick you have to put on your floor.-It is NVIDIA 3D Vision compatible (see other thoughts).-Great for dual/triple monitor setups!Also, for those of you that have been ticked off countless times because your monitors didn't include a DVI cable, never fear! It does in fact include a DVI cable!","Cons:None that I can honestly think of. The stand/base does make a creaky noise if I slightly shake my desk, but I rarely ever end up doing this with my desk. However it could just be a problem only with mine and not a design flaw. Also yes, this IS an expensive monitor, but nothing is free, right? Besides, the quality is worth it.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Outstanding !,2015-04-05,Pros:Wonderful display'(s) I bought two of these and without a doubt the picture and price of these is just perfect. 10/10,Cons:Nothing...!,"Other Thoughts:I bought a third party stand for a three screen setup, it was hard to take the stands off of these because the stands they come with are so awesome! They raise and lower really high/low great tilt and horizontal to vertical position in seconds.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,very impressed.,2015-04-04,"Pros:Noticeable difference in my graphics smoothness going from 60hz to 144hz.  Even with a GTX980 it is a big improvement in visual quality.  The monitor feels like it is good quality and the stand is excellent,  sturdy and highly adjustable.",Cons:The G-sync chips are no longer available for this monitor.  It does not come with a display port cable.,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great for FPS Games,2015-03-31,Pros:I've had this monitor for about 5 months now. I noticed a difference playing CS:GO immediately after launching. I am 100% satisfied with this monitor. If you are looking for the next upgrade to keep you on the top of your game look no further.,Cons:I cannot think of any cons at this time.,"Other Thoughts:You can find color calibration profiles for this monitor online. I wouldn't pay attention to any of the negative reviews about the color. It doesn't come out of the box perfect, but takes 10 minutes to get there.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,best monitor I've ever had,2015-03-31,Pros:10/10 I Absolutely love this monitor amazing color great refresh rate and 1ms response time great HD 1080p resolution and it just over all looks great,Cons:One con is that I have a dead pixel at the left corner... Not to noticeable in game because it's in a corner but still bothers me hopefully I can get the monitor shipped back and returned with a new one,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,GREAT MONITOR!,2015-03-31,Pros:Everything you could ask for in a monitor! Shipped all the way across the states with no dead pixels and misc damage. Very pleased with this outcome!!!

You need to change the Hz in Windows settings.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2015-03-30,Pros:Smooth as eggs in CS:GO and other FPS games. Tweak the colors and you're set. Don't forget to make sure 144hz is set in both windows and your ATI or Nvidia control panel.This was a huge upgrade from my old 2ms Viewsonic VX922.,"Cons:The built-in crosshairs are too big to be practical.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Just Wow,2015-03-26,"Pros:After having this monitor for over a year, all I can say is wow. This monitor is great for gaming. I play CS:GO and instantly noticed a difference in my play when I switched from a 60hz monitor. I also have my PS4 hooked up to it, yes you don't get the 144hz refresh but that does not matter. The colors are smooth and crisp with a little tweaking. I would recommend this over pricier models such as the BenQ monitors.",Cons:-None,Other Thoughts:- About to order another monitor since I just ordered all the parts for another computer.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best non Gsync/Freesync monitor for gaming,2015-03-24,Pros:- No dead pixels- Decent color quality (for a TN panel)- Refresh rate,Cons:- None thus far,"Other Thoughts:Hands down the best monitor I've had since my days of lugging around a 19"" NEC CRT in college to LAN parties my friends would host.  Yeah, totally just dated myself there...but I don't mind.  :)Really, though, haven't been throughly impressed with a monitor since that old CRT (which failed on me after 2 years, replaced with a refurb only to have it do the same).  Running my current frequented games (Guild Wars 2 and Diablo 3) without Vsync and at 144 hz results in buttery smoothness.  I've also acquired the MSI GTX 970 to go along with this monitor, and it's made for a wonderful upgrade over my seemingly ancient Asus VW246H and GTX 570.If you're looking for a great gaming display, but don't have the bank for a fancy doodle Gsync/Freesync unit, go for this one.  There's a reason it has a 5 egg overall rating with nearly a thousand reviews.  Just cross your fingers for no dead pixels, of course.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beat gaming monitor for the money,2015-03-24,Pros:No dead pixelsDecent color qualityRefresh rate,Cons:None so far,"Other Thoughts:Just replaced my ancient Asus VW246H with this model. It is worlds better for gaming. Not needing to run games with vsync on has made for a much smoother experience. Color quality is markedly better as well.  If you are in the market for a gaming display but can't fathom shelling out 700+ bucks for a Gsync/Freesync monitor, pick up one of these.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing3D,2015-03-22,Pros:I bought this monitor for 1 purpose and 1 purpose only - 3D GAMING.This thing rocks. Lightboost is for real - twice as good as regular Nvidia 3D which I previously had. Makes all the difference. Just jaw dropping amazing.,Cons:None really worth mentioning,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great for Gaming. IPS otherwise,2015-03-21,"Pros:-144hz Refresh Rate, got rid of screen tearing I had with 60hz monitor (V sync doesn't even fix tearing all the time, especially in applications like YouTube)WARNING, it now hurts to fo back to using 60hz monitors even when scrolling web pages-1ms response time, Personally I can't tell the difference between 5ms and 1ms, but a higher response rate can ruin a gaming experience due to ghosting-3D??? Haven't used it (Have and amd card and not interested)-Lots of connections-Great stand functionalities (Like rotation and tilt) and it is great to be able to easily adjust height, it is much better on your neck to be able to raise the monitor to head level. Also, it is extremely sturdy and almost no reason to mount it, but you could since it has vesa mounts :)","Cons:-My first one arrived and showed black and white strips on the left side of the screen. I could fix this by unplugging it and plugging it back in for a while, but after about two weeks the lines were permanent. HOWEVER, getting a replacement was really easy through newegg (Took about 20 min) and I got a replacement within two weeks including sending it back.-144hz only works with display port or dual link dvi, however the same is true for other monitors-Speakers are low quality??? But honestly, if you buy a $300 monitor at least buy some $40 speakers (Mine cost that and sound alright, but not a as huge audiophile)-Colors aren't very good, but they can be fixed easily with slight setting tuning (Takes 15 min). HOWEVER, almost all IPS panels will still have better looking colors even after vast improvements with setting changes.-Bezels are on the thicker side, would have expected better for the price. However, the bezel is the same distance around which is really important for multiscreen gaming in portrait (3840x1920 I believe, typing on phone and too lazy to open calculator)",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great gaming monitor,2015-03-20,"Pros:- 144Hz @ 1ms.  Noticeable?  Absolutely!- clear, sharp and colorful- significantly reduces motion blur- smooth as buttery silk... or silky butter maybe",Cons:nothing comes to mind,"Other Thoughts:NOTE:  144Hz *requires* a DisplayPort connection.  I found out the hard way.- To address the concern of a washed out look, you can tweak the settings and obtain an .icm profile.  A web search for ""glorious ASUS VG248QE"" should point you in the right direction.- It really didn't need to come with speakers... seriously, what gamer uses monitor speakers...?",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Pretty amazing!,2015-03-19,Pros:This bad boy is top notch. It is excellent for those twitch games like CSGO and BF4. super fast reaction time. it is for the most part plug and play and easy to set up.,"Cons:The buttons and stand are cheaper,  they defiantly spent all the money on the screen and technology. so maybe not so much of a con but still cheap plastic parts.",,0,0

The first one I bought over a month ago had a dead pixel. To some people it may not be a big deal, but I have huge OCD issues about my computer setup. Instead of sending it back and waiting forever for a new one, I bought another straight away and just sold the one I had to a friend. The new one that came had a dead pixel as well. I may give up and deal with it, I don't know. I just wish I could be able to buy a monitor without any dead pixels.",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Good monitor,2015-03-12,Pros:Fast response time. Little to no screen tearing. The many different pre-set screen modes.,Cons:Can't adjust contrast in Standard Mode. Screen looks a bit glossy. As if it is too bright even when turning the brightness down. Though I think this is only natural for this type of monitor.,Other Thoughts:My last monitor was an ASUS HK241...had it for 6 years and loved it. But it was getting rainbow colored lines on the screen itself. I needed a replacement. I had to scoop this VG248QE up for the specs and the price. Great monitor despite my little complaints.,0,0

As the nvidia site directly linked me to this monitor with the option of buying a gsync module later on. Now I see monitors from asus selling gsync enabled monitors. I belive I was a victim of false advertising as I have been waiting a year for the module to surface.,,1,2

If I plug headphones into my PC so all the noise comes out of my headphones, the monitor still buzzes. If I pull the 3.5mm audio cord out of the monitor, the noise stops. Also, if I turn the monitor volume to 0 it goes away. But again, lots of hassle for a product I paid around $300 for.So I spent this much on a monitor and have to buy separate speakers too. After a quick google search, I found that this seems to be a pretty common problem, which is too bad.The washed out colors on the other hand, CAN be fixed by getting an ICC profile from the web, a quick google search will yield good results.Other than the problem I could fix, and the one I've band-aided the monitor is pretty good. Would I recommend it? Only if your budget allows for a decent set of desktop speakers to go with it.",0,4
ASUS,VG278Q,5,An awesome upgrade,2015-02-21,"Pros:144hz refresh rate, adjustable, comes with DisplayPort support... This monitor is just sweet. Out of the box some setting tweaks are needed, but the screen is amazing for gaming. Not just PC gaming either. Plugged my PS3 up to the monitor and have been having a ball with GT6.","Cons:As some have mentioned already, darks and brights are a bit... Lacking. Also, while TraceFree does make things look nicer, when turned up it does cause some weird ghosting effects on some games. Finally, HDMI is NOT capable of anything above 60hz. Fine for console games, but for those who want more, you probably wanna hook your video card up to either DisplayPort or DVI.","Other Thoughts:Haven't tested: 3D (those nVidia kits are TOO expensive right now...

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Damaged out of box,2015-02-18,"Pros:144hz, movement is very smooth with movies and games that have the framerate.","Cons:Damaged out of box, a line of dead/discolored pixels running from top to bottom. I contacted ASUS support, but they would not even listen to my issue, say I should return it instead of contacting them. That means $30 to ship it back on top of the original cost, for a defective unit.In addition, the colors are washed out and the brightness seems off. It takes a lot of tweaking to make it look decent.","Other Thoughts:One of the reasons I went with ASUS was because I heard they had excellent customer support and I thought they would cover issues like this. If you decide to get one, I recommend going with a store with a local location so that if you end up with a defective unit, you can easily return it without the shipping charges.It doesn't seem right for customers to eat the cost of shipping back defective merchandise.",7,4
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Great Monitor But...,2015-02-17,"Pros:Great monitor overall, I really do love it.Much better image quality than my old Asus 60hz 1080p monitor, which I truly wasn't expecting considering that this one is the same resolution.The 144hz refresh rate, plus the very low response time; make this monitor amazingly smooth on the eyes, as the movement on the screen is so fluid. I don't think I can ever go back to 60hz refresh rate!","Cons:Sadly I will have to give three stars instead of five, because mines has a really annoying red dead pixel close to the center of the screen. It didn't have it when I first opened the monitor, then a few days later it just came out of nowhere.I really hate this, and I wasn't able to RMA because I haven't had the time. So I'll have to take this up with Asus.",Other Thoughts:Dead pixels are a pain!,1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,1,ASUS VG248QE (QUALITY ERROR),2015-02-15,Pros:144 Hz is absolutely incredible.Picture is great.Almost zero motion blur.One heavy draw back however..Use a DVI cable to keep your 144Hz if your DisplayPort is bust.,"Cons:Be ready to RMA.. (I RMA'd one of my two and am looking to re-RMA the first, as well as RMA'ing the second one.)I have used three different brand names of DisplayPort cable providers, and I have recently made the switch from an EVGA 780 Ti to DUAL EVGA 980 FTW edition graphics cards, the only thing that remained the same were the monitors I purchased. (I bought two of these sadly) Both monitors I have (one was sent back on an RMA) have the same issue, the Display Port is poorly made. As stated, I've tried three different brand displayport cables, as well as display port 1.1 and 1.2 and nothing seems to work right. Conclusion being after my troubleshooting that it is the monitor itself. Poor quality control which is sad because I have been a long time fan of ASUS for their motherboards. But two different monitors with the same results, as well as many others reviewing the same results as I have encountered.. Even after they RMA""d one it came back and within several weeks began doing the same thing.",Other Thoughts:Get used to seeing this............ *headache*Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.Display Port not recognized.,3,4

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent monitor for the price,2015-02-14,"Pros:Not much I can say that hasn't already been said. Beautiful monitor with great features and a button that changes color temps and such on the fly for a variety of different and beautiful color displays. Some are too intense for my eyes but that's a good thing. It shows how powerful the monitor is. The 144hz aspect is also really sweet. After using it at frame rates well over 60fps for so long and having gotten used to it, when going back to something that's 60fps, it's instantly noticeable and 60fps looks choppy and weak.It also swivels and transforms and even has 3D capability (albeit with no transmitter).",Cons:The DVI cord that it comes with is really short. Annoyingly so.The labeling for the function buttons on the unit is is almost the same color as the black plastic it's printed on. Very hard to see. Very stupid design choice.,"Other Thoughts:The screen mode button is like an instant ENB mode that uses no CPU power. Very cool feature to add some brilliance to otherwise dull media, no matter what it is.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Perfect Purchase,2015-02-09,"Pros:You can't go wrong with this monitor.  Do a quick google search to optimize the colors and download an ICC profile.  I've played Battlefiled, CS:GO, COD:AW  1080p with max settings and it looks great.  I also use the lightboost hack for a smoother experience.  The lightboost hack does dim the monitor a little bit but can be fixed w/in-game gamma settings.  A lot of people complain about washed out colors but I really don't notice much of difference while in game.I replaced a 42"" Samsung TV with this monitor and I will never go back.",Cons:the height adjustment could have started closer to the base but no big deal.,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beautiful!,2015-02-09,"Pros:Don't hesitate.  1080p is the way to go at this price point and the fluidity while gaming will add so much to the experience.  I own four of these and Battlefield 4 on 3, at 5760x1080, is marvelous.Color quality is VERY easily calibrated without fancy tools.  Backlight ratio has no bleeding and colors are vivid and sharp on ALL FOUR that I own.  People who complain about these things very obviously did not invest enough time in fixing something they claim to care so much about.","Cons:Plastic felt sort of...  Off, thin maybe, but they've been moved around practically every couple weeks, riding in my car for 20 mile trips and back, carried up stairs, no scratches and even though they get a little hot they still look brand new.","Other Thoughts:A few reviews mentioned not doing their homework.  You will need to invest in good DVI cables for quality 144hz output.  Your graphics card needs to support it as well.  Do NOT even think about using HDMI if you want higher than 60hz.  That would be a shame if you tried.  Overall, these are brilliant monitors and deserve as much praise as possible.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Jawdropping,2015-02-08,"Pros:This insane monitor is made for people who wants a fast and fluid gaming experience. This is a TN panel; Which means less color precision but ultra fast response times and a speed capability. Digital media creator: This screen is not something you want.This screen is all made of glossy plastic, except the vertical stand. Do not expect an ""Apple-like-thin"" product, but for the power residing inside this screen, I would say it's clearly not too bulky. The bezel is moderately thin. Now, I'm not a multiple screen fan and my knowledge on the subject is limited, but I think you could set these up for a multiple screen setup yet the gap might be a bit noticeable.As soon as I plugged it in AND configured it correctly, I fell off my chair. Dragging an Explorer window never felt so pleasing to my eyes. It was literally insane to see how fluid everything moved in front of me. Now for the gaming experience, especially for in the first-person shooters genre, the result is once again insane. BF4 at Ultra is delicious for the eyes on this screen.Input AND output audio! If you're like me and have a console right next to your PC, then you're in business! The HDMI input is useful for such devices as the audio coming from the HDMI can be rerouted out of the screen and inserted an alternative input (Aux port on speakers, line in of the PC...)Overall, this screen delivers what you expect of it if you have the right gear and 5 minutes to tweak it (Have no fear, the settings are very easy to configure.)I'll post my in-screen settings in the ""Other thoughts"" section.","Cons:Few details...There is a ""3D"" sign/logo printed on the round-shaped base of the monitor, which is aesthetically annoying.An nVidia 3D Vision is heavily glued on the upper left corner of the screen. As an AMD owner. I do not find this sticker appealing.Again on the screen base, some ""catchy"" sentences like ""Ready for 3D pc games & videos"". (It's subtle, but there.) I know it. It's written in the manual and on the box. Asus, don't write these on the actual screen!The Audio coming out of the line out of the screen has a noticeable high-pitch electric buzz. Of course it is covered by the actual sound of the game but can be heared when the sound is at low level.","Other Thoughts:You need a DisplayPort version 1.2 or a DualLink DVI in order to reach the 144Hz mark. Forget that HDMI cable!To save you some precious time, here are my in-screen settings. This is my personal preference considering my gear, eyes and room I'm sitting in.

So, HBOGO and Netflix will go static if you don't lower refresh rate from 144Hz to 120Hz.Of course this is to no fault of the monitor, just throwing this out there.",,2,0

ASUS,VG278Q,2,Having Issues.,2015-01-29,Pros:Very quality structurally and appearance is wonderful. Monitor not so much but i may be doing things very wrong. You tell me. PLEASE :D,Cons:not doing well 4 days in,Other Thoughts:So this may be because im using an intel hd 4700 with hdmi and not displayport.I am posting to see if anyone has this issue.Whenever i look around in games there is severe trailing and the pixels respond very slowly to color change. I am currently waiting on my gtx 980 to show up.However i hooked it up to a friends computer with an actual graphics card and it seemed to function correctly with displayport.Also i cannot get the monitor to have sound unless i use my sound system and hook directly to my motherboard. Which i do whenever at home.  Please somebody console my suspicion :)I am very disturbed at it this far.,1,10
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great Monitor!!!,2015-01-28,Pros:Monitor is just fantastic. It screams a quality build when you touch it. I had already thought it was of quality build but i was still impressed by it. Havent had a chance to test it out really because my GPU hasnt shown up yet but im guessing it will be quite impressive. No dead pixels or stuck pixels.,Cons:power cable is shortcolors are washed out... (havent tuned them yet)crosshair add on is pretty cheesy and would guess ill never use it. we will seenewegg didnt put it inside another boxUPS delivered it to my porch super early in the morning and didnt knock or anything. So a fancy looking box sitting on my porch for 4 or 5 hours kind of P'd me off :PPeople are kind of sketchy around where i live.,,3,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great gaming monitor!,2015-01-28,"Pros:Fantastic monitor for the price.  144hz refresh rate is instantly noticeable, especially with a 60hz monitor placed next to it in a dual-screen setup.  The stand works well and swivel feature is neat for those that might use it.  By far the brightest monitor I have ever had.  The colors are vibrant and won't require much tweaking out of the box.  Timer and crosshairs are a nice addition, if that's your thing.","Cons:The speakers are located on the top/rear of the monitor leaving a bit to be desired in the audio department, but ultimately not what I bought the monitor for, just a nice add-on in my personal opinion, just don't expect top class sound coming from them.  Also, the base came with two scratches just under the audacious 3D symbol.  Doesn't affect the monitor in anyway, just disappointed that a blemish such as this would come straight out of the box.","Other Thoughts:Ultimately a great 1080p gaming monitor with serviceable built-in speakers and a few neat additions.  If that is what you are looking for, this monitor will not disappoint!",3,0

ASUS,VG278Q,1,worst display i have seen in years,2015-01-26,Pros:144hz?,"Cons:washed out, poor color reproduction.","Other Thoughts:i would give less than 1 star if i could.  i am a network admin/desktop support and i install multiple LCDs every month.  i have not seen such a poor quality, washed out display in a long time.  i have been a gamer since the CRT days playing at 100hz and i was VERY amped up to get back over 100hz finally.   i should have listened to all the reviews that said this display was poor quality.  i have gone over all the settings and calibrations but still can't get this thing looking even OK.   i will be hooking up my dell ultrasharp 8ms IPS pannels and go back to 60hz as it is much better than looking at this junk panel.  DO NOT BUY THIS!",1,12
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Absolutely Stunning,2015-01-26,"Pros:First off lets start with the sleek design. The shine looks great just, it's a finger print magnet and scuffs are easy. The stand is EASILY adjustable, if to push it up or down, it stays where you want it. The 144hz, 1MS response time gives an edge in competitive gaming in games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. I personally like the little ""3D"" logo on the base, I think it just makes it less plain. Immediately after purchasing this one, I went out and got ANOTHER one. I works just as great and looks just as great.",Cons:Bezel could be thinner.,"Other Thoughts:Make sure that you are using a DVI or Display Port to get the best out of these monitors. HDMI can't support 1080p at 144hz, as well as VGA (EWWW).",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2015-01-26,"Pros:i love it very clear. made such a difference from my old monitors, had a 1280 x 1024 and a 1600 x 900. now i have two of these and it gave me such a performance spike in my gaming.",Cons:none so far,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Excellent! Finally working, but not perfect!",2015-01-25,"Pros:Not going to go with the features here, we all know that this monitor can do and what's is capable of!","Cons:Seems that there's a strange issue while streaming Netflix while using Chrome browser at 144hz. Whenever I play or stream videos on full screen with this monitor, it seems that white noise/static appears when you are running this monitor on full hertz!To fix this, you must set your monitor to 120hz or use a different browser at 144hz.","Other Thoughts:I had to RMA this monitor once because the first one I received had screen bleeding issues and of course, some imperfections.Aside from this, I received the 2nd monitor and this one works better now as the screen bleeding is gone and works as good!The issue above seems to happen in the following scenarios:In my experience so far:Netflix + Chrome + 144hz = not workingNetflix + other browsers + 144hz = fineNetflix + Chrome + 60hz/120hz = fineWindows Media Player/VLC + 144hz = fineOther video sites through Chrome (iPlayer/youtube) + 144hz = fineSo overall, this may not be a monitor issue, but a plug in issue with chrome and Netflix, so there's no need to freak out because this is browser bug.This is long story short:Chrome enabled MSE / ESE and Netflix started utilizing it instead of Silverlight which is causes the bug above with this monitor. DO NOT RMA! JUST RESEARCH THE PROBLEM!Even then, this is still a good monitor!",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Stuck at 60hz,2015-01-24,Pros:No dead pixels.. works fine for a normal monitor.,Cons:Monitor will not go over 60hz.,"Other Thoughts:Have tried everything to get this monitor switched to 144 or 120hz and it just will not happen. Figured it was my AMD 7950 first so just dealt with it for a year. Now that I have a nVidia 970 and it still has the same error, I now know it is the monitor.Any time you adjust it over 60hz (through your gpu controls or windows) it blurs everything and says incorrect cable. Also figured the dual link dvi that came with it might possibly be damaged and purchased a new one. Still have the same problem. Recently rebuilt my entire computer, new gpu, new mobo, memory, etc.. Still no dice.Will buy a new monitor and use this one as a third.  Gave two eggs because if it you are not gaming it is not a bad monitor.",1,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2015-01-23,"Pros:Fast clean video, lots of space to open multiple app's and love the gaming performance. Easy to use control interface once you get used to the menus. I like the gamming interface (has a clock timer and several gun sight choices you can set up for those favorite shooting games) I've mounted three side by side in landscape and wow! Tested the built in speakers (decent sound) but prefer my 7.1 CLIPSCH surround.",Cons:Don't have room for three more on my desk top :(,Other Thoughts:The boarder edges of the frame (enclosure) could be a little thinner on the sides for multiple monitor set-ups like this one. Otherwise this is a great monitor for the money.Good job ASUS!,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Dead Pixel in the Middle of the Screen,2015-01-22,"Pros:144hz, Multiple connection options","Cons:Within the first 6 months of owning this monitor two pixels failed at the center of the screen. Due to the fact that it is ""only"" two dead pixels ASUS refuses to RMA this product. They have stated that their warranty will only accept RMAs if there are 4 or more dead pixels. This does not take into account that the location of the dead pixels is at the center of the screen. I tried for a few months to just ignore them but when you're playing games with lens flair and other effects that utilize brightness, they appear as plain as day and serve as an immense distraction. Considering this is an enthusiast level product, I would expect much better service through ASUS but after 15 years they have finally failed me with a product and a service... Great job at losing a customer.",,7,5
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Ghosting galore!,2015-01-22,"Pros:Great design, amazing out of the box stand with swivel mount, good colors for a TN panel, and of course the 144 Hertz refresh rate.",Cons:To my extreme disappointment the VG248 I received had a major ghosting problem right from the start. Any video/gif/etc. that moves in the slightest has a major noticeable afterimage of the last frame. The problem gets worse in game.,,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best LCD... hands down!,2015-01-22,Pros:Got on black friday for under $200!!! (Amazing deal)144Hz with 1ms is the best setup!Once you got to 144Hz you won't want anything else!Everything looks HD!!!,Cons:DisplayPort craps out when waking up from sleep; use DVI instead... lol (common issue with that technology),Other Thoughts:Just use DVI cable that is suppliedPlay around with settings to get best color display (there is a download online that allows you to auto-calibrate the LCD with Windows) -- I calibrated and just use the Scenery mode for best colorsDon't forget to make sure Windows (or w/e OS) is using monitor in 144 and not 60!!!,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,colors are washed out and over exposed,2015-01-22,"Pros:This monitor is fast, I can tell the difference by just dragging windows around! It can do 3D. The swivel adjustments are the best I've ever used.","Cons:At high hz, mostly at 120hz, and 140hz the colors are less vivid by a noticeable amount and everything is over exposed. I've been trying to match it up with my 23"" asus monitor with no luck. If I tone down the contrast everything looks bland but then it's not over-exposed. You can't really notice it in games or movies but one the desktop it is hard to read.","Other Thoughts:I like everything but the overexposure, the higher contrast ratio on this monitor led me to believe it would be a better picture. maybe it is just a limitation of DVI-D Dual Link but I don't know of any alternative that can support these refresh rates, display port perhaps...",1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Everything blends into white,2015-01-21,Pros:This monitor is very fast. I can drag windows around and notice smoother response.,Cons:I almost can't read black text on the screen because the text is overcome by the white background. This only happens at 120 - 144hz. 60hz looks fine. I am using the dual link dvi cable that came in the box. I'm not very happy with this contrast. I've tried adjusting the settings but it ends up looking bland if I make it tolerable.,,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beautiful.,2015-01-21,Pros:The monitor is beautiful the red accent on it goes with my setup. It's 144hz 1m2 and it has the motion blue light boost available through blurbusters.com. I have not 1 bad thing to say about this monitor. I love Asus.,Cons:none straight beast for gaming FPS.,Other Thoughts:buy it.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Updated review,2015-01-21,Pros:-Refresh rate-Stand-Color quality (for a TN),"Cons:The displayport stopped working after a few months. This monitor is $275. It's a TN. I could get a better picture quality for $100 less. I paid for the refresh rate, but that 144hz is only available over displayport. I would expect a longer lifespan.","Other Thoughts:Overall, it's a good display, as long as issues like this aren't common.",1,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Simply Put, A Great Monitor",2015-01-18,Pros:The specs are great for both 2D and 3D gaming. Built in speakers work for me. I have my Wii U hooked up to it as well as my computer.

Quality, it's quite exceptional. Value, it's unmatched. Watching movies on it is very nice! Gaming, while sporting a decent GPU, is butter smooth and superbly pleasing especially since you can utilize the 144Hz goodness. Would and have recommended this monitor to my friends","Cons:No con on this monitor is substantial enough to be an egg knock-off. The built-in speakers are sub-par, but that's not an issue to most considering it's build directive as a gaming monitor. I did say it is very Aesthetically beautiful, however my only gripe is that reflective black piano paneling.",,0,0

(To be expected kind of),"Other Thoughts:My monitor has a dead pixel and I have submitted a ticket to ASUS and have not gotten a response in over 72 hours which is 24 more hours than their guaranteed 48 hour response time.My brand new monitor should not have a dead pixel, especially at this price.",2,1

ASUS,VG278Q,2,Did I get a bad batch?,2015-01-07,Pros:●144 Hz panel looks amazing with my games!●Good tilt and pivot●Calibrated well●Looks awesome in a 3-screen setup!,"Cons:I might have bought my three from a batch of screens with faulty power supplies.First screen I bought September 30, 2014.  It failed to turn on November 29, 2014 -- lasted only two months.  Power supply made a modulating frequency noise and the power button light wouldn't illuminate.  Filed RMA and got the repaired screen (same serial number btw) back from ASUS on 12/17.Tonight (January 7, 2015-- only THREE WEEKS) the same screen died again with same modulating frequency.Questionable power supplies in these monitors.A second screen out of my three total also failed to power on one night, but after leaving it unplugged for a few minutes and plugging it back in it turned on.","Other Thoughts:Extremely disappointed with the screen.  I bought two more of these during Black Friday and couldn't do Eyefinity for nearly three weeks while the RMA repair took place.Now I'm stuck again because the repair screen is dead [again], and I have to pay another $25 to ship it to ASUS (up to $50 invested additional in RMAing so far!) and have them make another repair.  How long is it gonna last this time?  When should I plan for my my other two screens to die and leave me without my full setup?  I checked my power strip and wall outlet...120V exactly so it's not getting overvolted.Lastly, I sent my screen to ASUS for repair in the complete, original box plus packaging.  I got it back in a plain box in a hard-shell airbag that completely ruined the plastic casing of my entire monitor.  The base and mounting arm weren't secured in the box and scratched everything up while in transit.I did an escalation ticket (WTM20141217.....) on December 17th and still haven't gotten a response.  Now I need to do both a new RMA and a new escalation for this!Very unhappy.  These were my first 24"" screens ever and my first tri-monitor setup, and so far it hasn't been a good experience.",9,1

Had to RMA it because G-SYNC is only available on this monitor if you buy the DIY Mod Kit (which is also extremely risky and voids the warranty), and they no longer sell said kits.However, if you don't care about having G-SYNC, with a little love, this monitor gives a lot of bang for your buck!Hoping that I get what I want out of a ASUS PG278Q monitor.Just praying mine doesn't arrive with dead pixels or general ""QC Issues"" I keep reading about on here...You're scaring me guys!",2,6

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent Gaming Monitor Received Exactly What I Wanted,2015-01-04,"Pros:I came from a Nokia 445xi Plus CRT that was running 1280x1024 @100Hz. I refused to go over to the awful 60hz LCD options out there so I was even a little afraid to buy this.Proven so wrong: Monitor is amazing for gaming as long as the engine and your PC can maintain the 144+ fps. I ended up having to buy a new video card, however, bc on newer games it couldn't manage 1080p ~144 fps. Not a con though!","Cons:As many people said, the colors are a little washed out the monitor is very bright. This is excellent for gaming but for watching movies or television there are better 60hz options with better color.","Other Thoughts:If you've experienced high refresh rate gameplay and know how amazing it is you probably have a solution already, however, if you are on the fence about it:Buy this and thank me later.",3,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Delivers as promised,2014-12-30,Pros:White looks white and black looks black. It's bright and displays colors accurately and vibrantly. Has a nice stand with all the options stated. I use the monitor vertically and although it is not an ISP display I'm impressed with the viewing angles and am very happy with this monitor.,Cons:Power cable is kind of short (3 feet).,Other Thoughts:Wish it was easier to figure out low blue light mode. Makes my other three year old monitor look dim and washed out. Seem to have a frame rate issue on dual monitor setup when running a game on this monitor at 120 hertz and desktop on other monitor at 60 hertz. Game was in windowed mode though. Frame rate issue went away when I turned off second monitor.,2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great monitor on its own, trouble with multiple displays",2014-12-30,"Pros:No dead pixels, missing/flawed parts, or any other initial setup problems. Easy setup and installation, beautiful picture quality and outstanding video output with its resolution and screen refresh rate on my NVidia GTX card. Very flexible adjustment for those who might use it as well.","Cons:It doesn't seem to like being a replacement for my other, smaller monitor when used at the same time. After making several adjustments involving booting the PC up and adjusting multiple displays settings, it still tends to prioritize my old monitor as the 'main' monitor. It displays the startup screen and opens any newly opened applications in it when used as an extended monitor, and frequently even rearranges all my desktop icons on the main monitor as if it's trying to fit to a 1366x768 resolution (the monitor's old max res).","Other Thoughts:Overall a great gaming monitor despite the trouble with introducing it to my system as the new 'primary' display device, which is really more of an annoyance or slight nuisance than anything. Especially recommended for those with a decently high-end NVidia card, as that allows for maximum possible display potential and fancy 3D video output.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,One year still going strong,2014-12-26,"Pros:144hz, good build quality, great stand set up, +1 year heavy use no issues.",Cons:Cheesy THREE DEE graphics on stand (acceptable for demo models - not my desk @ home) Obviously the stock colours/settings are terrible and need to be adjusted but I bought the product for the specs not the stock settings.,"Other Thoughts:I waited a year+ to post this review. After research, price comparison and performance debate I made the purchase and I have not regretted it in the slightest. I was waiting to perhaps snag another one after Christmas but I see they are sold out - no surprise there. ASUS continues to impress me. Thanks guys.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Be sure this monitor suits your intended use,2014-12-26,"Pros:Fast refresh rate using DVI input, and thus low motion blur.Well engineered adjustable stand.",Cons:Poor color rendition.Poor viewing angles.,"Other Thoughts:WARNING: This monitor excels at fast screen refresh, and many feel it is an excellent gaming monitor, but its flaws make it a questionable choice for other tasks.I bought this monitor after seeing a multitude of rave reviews.  At first I was impressed, and initially wrote a review praising it (which I am unable to edit).  My initial favorable impressions were based on use in gaming, and that is the forte of this monitor.  However, I intended it to be an all around desktop monitor.  I discovered that the graphics displayed when surfing websites, viewing videos, or just looking at my computer desktop would have oversaturated and inaccurate colors, despite optimization using the recommended procedures with ICC color profiles found within other reviews here.  Compounding the problem was the fact that the color intensity and hue varied noticeably from top to bottom of the screen without my head moving, while looking straight on.  I found out that these flaws are characteristic of VN panels.  I finally returned the monitor and selected a different model.",3,3

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great,2014-12-22,"Pros:No ghosting, screen tearing in most games is less noticeable than on a 60Hz monitor, and the difference between 60 and 144Hz is night and day, even when I can't actually maintain 144 frames per second.",Cons:Contrast and colour could be better. Prepare to either miss people in the dark or crank your brightness high enough that outdoor scenes (such as in BF4 on Operation Locker) look pure white.,"Other Thoughts:Wanted to make a correction to an earlier reviewer who said this:""Having next to no input lag means you can react faster when action happens on screen, meaning my K/D went up and I make more kids rage quit more often""For one thing, almost every single monitor has under 10ms response time these days, and most TVs have a gaming mode to reduce the standard response time. This means that there is no perceivable input lag because the monitor responds quicker than frames (on a standard 60Hz monitor, there are 16 milliseconds between each frame). Thus whether you have a 1ms response time or 15ms response time, you won't be able to notice a difference in input lag. If there was, the problem lies somewhere beyond this.More importantly, frequency response time has to do with how the pixels on the monitor can update. The lower the response time, the less ghosting there is. Ghosting is where in a moving picture it looks blurry, for example if you have text scrolling sideways across your screen on a standard 5-10ms monitor, it will be fuzzy and difficult to read. On 1ms monitor, the pixels update faster and don't have blurring, so you get a clearer image during motion and can read text while it's scrolling across your screen.Apologies for the rant, just kinda get annoyed when people with alleged 5-star tech level claim that the lower frequency response time affects their reaction time in games. Typical human reaction time is well over a hundred milliseconds anyways, so the difference between 1ms and 5ms even if it was an extra frame likely wouldn't make a perceivable difference.Anyways, I highly recommend this monitor. Its image quality (due to contrast and colours) isn't amazing, but is better than BenQ's lower cost 144Hz panels.The biggest downside to this monitor is that it's going to make playing MMOs painful when they drop down to 30 fps in raids =P",3,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,So many frames...,2014-12-09,"Pros:144Hz and a 1ms response time makes for a super smooth experience. After some calibration the monitor looks great although still not quite as pretty as an IPS panel, but for gaming a TN panel such as this one is the only way to go. Coming from someone who has been using a 1360 x 768 TV with a response time of 8ms the difference was certainly noticeable. I have yet to try this with the Nvidia Lightboost hack, but the experience has been positive so far.","Cons:Pretty gross lookin at stock settings; the monitor is too bright and the colors are washed out. All is not lost as these problems can be fixed with some calibrating and an ICC profile. (Tutorials can be found on tomshardware.com and reddit. Just search, ""calibrating asus vg248qe""). Not as good looking as a IPS panel, but no one is going to buy this for graphic design where accurate colors are a must-have. This is a gaming monitor and the inaccuracy of the colors really isn't that noticeable once calibrated. The built-in speakers aren't really that great so you'll definitetly want  to get some other sound system.",Other Thoughts:Don't forget to set the refresh rate to 144Hz in Windows settings using DVI-D or the display port. You'll also need a powerful enough of a GPU to reach frames higher than 60fps if you want to see a difference. Calibrate the monitor right away so it doesn't look so gross.

I searched for settings changes and used the procedure posted on tomshardware.com for this monitor using an ICC color profile. The instructions are detailed, so that it was manageable despite never having done this before. Further, I suggest that you go through the Windows wizard to adjust ClearType, found by right clicking on desktop, select Personalize, then Display, then Adjust ClearType text.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great monitor for gaming, not ready OOTB",2014-12-07,"Pros:This monitor is worth the pain you go through to setup right.  Vivid colors, awesome refresh rate and amazing for gaming (as most reviews state) but not recommended for low-experience users or those scared to get in the weeds of setup.  This is one of the nicest gaming monitors I have ever seen, that is not over-stated in other reviews.I finally have a monitor with a beautiful black and white spectrum!  Colors are amazing and sharp and there is no edge glow from the back light...but there are tradeoffs (see cons).  I have not used the 3-D capability yet so cannot comment there.","Cons:Not at all ready out-of-the-box (OOTB) and vertical view angle hurts a little.  It was almost like everything was set to max brightness, contrast and colors like TVs are in stores...but, that is not the case.  These are baseline settings.  This could be a good thing depending on your operating environment since you have a lot of wiggle room in the settings.In order to obtain the picture this monitor is capable of, I had to find a custom ICC profile (Google easy enough) and  went through some painful manual calibration.  Nearly all settings will need to be tuned to reduce the heavy saturation and vividness and to reduce the extensive brightness (headache-inducing type brightness).All in all, I had to tweak the Windows color profile, tweak the nVidia settings and the change all hardware settings.  This was a lot of work in alterations from default.  Default settings are TERRIBLE.  You WILL need to change these.  However, once you get it right, it is an amazing monitor!  One egg for the level of effort  ASUS left to the customer to get this up and running.Almost another egg lost for poor vertical view angles.  I have not noticed horizontal limits, but there are vertical view angle limits.  While not too severe (hence, no egg lost) if you use the monitor is a portrait (vertical) setup, you will run into dark-to-bright transitions...again, it is not severe.","Other Thoughts:ASUS should have provided software to assist in setting this up, or should have simply tuned a better default.  Water under the bridge.  I would definitely recommend using online resources that provide the sample screens needed for manual calibration (you will need to manually calibrate this).  Getting a great picture is not difficult, it just takes time to get right.If you are going to be doing photo or video editing, this may not be the monitor you are looking for (super refresh rate screens often are not).  The color spectrum seems too far off to get a reliable or true natural color set.  Note: I have not used hardware calibration devices, so it may be able to get there...just not by my eyeball-based calibration.In the end, for gaming, this monitor lives up to its reputation once you get it set.  Sorry for the redundancy, but the repetition is warranted.  Almost requested RMA...then I finally got it setup right.Mess with hardware settings first, Windows color profile second and finally, any further needed or fine grain changes via the nVidia or Radeon-based driver config.  Otherwise, you will keep running in circles with washed out light-dark and color saturation issues.",4,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Overall Great Purchase,2014-12-03,Pros:Out of the box the colors are a poor representation. ICC profiles are in limited availability for this model so don't bother. All you need to do is these simple steps to get a nice look....ready...set...1.) Put your monitor in Standard Mode2.) Go to your windows search bar and type Color Management        then click advanced and calibrate. **One of the last steps in the calibration is the RGB settings. All you need to do is dip the Red and Green Hue tabs to about 80% (leave the blue alone) and Boom there you go. The picture looks less HOT and washed out and has much better color representation.*Additionally i disabled the Nvidia color settings in the Nvidia control panel to allow for the windows calibration to be used instead.,Cons:Going into this I didn't know that High refresh rate LCD type monitors especially 144hz have limited color representation compared to others like my Samsung LED which has a very pleasant blue hue. This is a technical detail I didnt research prior to buying,Other Thoughts:I play BF4 mostly and your KD ration will increase and sniping is a whole different experience you can track targets so well its exciting..Remember to put the monitor and the game in 144hz mode and disable vertical sync from the BF4 Menu!,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,TBD,2014-12-03,Pros:Good cable quality: DVI/power cableMonitor stand has excellent adjustability seems durableComes with adapter for VGA if you still use it,Cons:I had it back to newegg because the back light was out will update when I get the new monitor in,,0,2
ASUS,VG278Q,1,A horrible monitor at best,2014-12-03,Pros:-144hz refresh rate would be great for competitive players.-The monitor itself looks great out of the box-Nice stand-HDMI port and DVI for 144hz as well as a display port-Great packaging,"Cons:Keep in mind this is also while having a widely known ICC profile installed with a highly recommended color RGB. I tried multiple over a few days.-Pathetically poor color-Washed out everything- Constant tearing for me-Viewing angles are quite honestly best described as ""Horrible"" as many others have said-1080p 144hz with a 16:9 display crop looks worse then my 60hz 1280x1024 5:4 SyncMaster that I had before this waste of money-For the picture the monitor is woth $125 at best.",Other Thoughts:I was very confidant in this monitor and trusted the other thousands of seemingly honest reviewers. Turns out this monitor is nothing more then a marketing stunt and there are a generous following of people that don't know any better to rate it based on its looks. The packaging and design itself probably cost more then the display being completely honest here.,3,14
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great montior, useless OSD crosshair",2014-12-03,Pros:Great looking & performing monitor for the price,"Cons:I was looking forward to having a hardware crosshair since lots of shooters nowadays have cones of fire rather than crosshairs, but the four included crosshairs are so enormous and gaudy that they're basically unusable.  A single pixel or 3x3 '+' would have been appropriate.  I had to come here and take a star off because it's insane to think that for a monitor aimed at high-end gamers that anyone that had ever even played a shooter in their lives thought that this was at all acceptable.","Other Thoughts:As others have mentioned, colors are pretty bad out of the box.  Looks great after adjusting the settings and using a color profile, so Google around.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing.,2014-12-02,Pros:(Last week it was $220) Still would've gotten it at $269 anyways. Great price. The screen isn't glossy like some TV's and Monitors which I hate. It's more of a matte so lights dont reflect off of it and you cant see yourself in it if the screen is dark. Build quality is 100%. The stand is built onto the back of the TV then tightened onto it's base after you take it out of the box. Has the tilt for easy access to the ports on the bottom(or if you use it sideways for whatever reason),Cons:Only thing wrong is the glossy part of the base of the stand for the monitor had a huge scratch across it. Saw it as soon as I pulled it out of the box. (I can't see it though once I put in where it's sitting at the moment because my room is so dark even with the lights on.),Other Thoughts:If you're thinking about getting this monitor DO IT. You won't regret it.(It's a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be),1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great monitor!,2014-12-02,Pros:1. Butter smooth2. Good image quality3. Will memory your option regarding the input ratio (I still play starcraft 1!),Cons:1. Takes 5 seconds back from sleep mode. My old dell monitor takes no time2. The monitor is leaning too forward. Not good for narrow desks.3. Build-in speaker is of low quality.4. Doesn't come with DP or HDMI cable. Only DVI cable,"Other Thoughts:comes with: DVI cable, speaker cable, power cord, drivers",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Good TN 144hz Display,2014-12-01,"Pros:-144Hz-Decent color for TN panel. (changed color temps to: 96, 94, 88)-Great price for features.-Lots of input options (display, double dvi)-Sturdy construction.","Cons:-It is a TN panel, so they colors could be better.",Other Thoughts:I'd definitely recommend it to any of my friends or colleagues.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Product!,2014-12-01,"Pros:1ms refresh, 144hz, beautiful colors, multiple default monitor views (standard/game/theatre/sRGB/etc..) that I have found to be very useful , in BF4 under the 'Game' setting for the monitor I can see enemies on hills hundreds of yards away, I feel almost guilty for how crisp this monitor is, almost like it gives me an advantage in the FPS games I play","Cons:The speakers are not very good. I mean, they work in a pinch and you can definitely hear everything but it sounds like a tin can amplifier. But who are we kidding, if you're rocking this monitor you probably have incredible headphones (I have my wireless logitechs) or an amazing sound system so this con isn't even worth removing an egg for","Other Thoughts:going from 60hz to 144hz was almost a religious experience. This monitor is amazing and I don't think i'll ever go back to 60hz ""cinematic mode""",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Worth It,2014-12-01,Pros:Fast refresh is noticeable immediately.  Bright colors and deep blacks.  Tilt/swivel/height adjustable stands are nice and solid.,Cons:The built-in speakers shouldn't be there.  ASUS would have been better off integrating a USB hub and leaving the speakers off entirely.  No cookies included.,Other Thoughts:Aside from the fact that the calibration out of the box is awful - these are great monitors.  I'm using 3 of them on a GTX 980 and the experience is fantastic.  Spend a few minutes adjusting the settings and you're good to go.  Three year warranty is better than most other manufacturers.,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Best thing for FPS gaming on a budget,2014-11-30,"Pros:•Great refresh rate.  As soon as I turned it on (and set the refresh rate to 144hz in the advanced screen resolution options, which I believe you usually have to do with windows) I noticed the smoothness and how much better even the little things, like browsing the web, moving windows, and moving the mouse looked.  I wish chrome would actually scroll at 120hz like firefox does, however.•Games feel more responsive, and actually hitting 144fps ingame is like a dream.  I feel like I not only perform better in games, but also enjoy it more.•Viewing angles are enjoyable.   Sometimes watch videos on this and sit back, about 20 degrees below it. Colors seem pretty consistent even at that angle.  This is an improvement from watching on my VS247h-p.","Cons:•The colors seem a little bland at first when I turn on the monitor.  I don't know if it's my eyes adapting to it or the monitor ""warming up"", but everything looks great after 5 minutes.I do notice that sometimes everything looks like the contrast level tripled though.","Other Thoughts:People talk about using that blurbusters lightboost hack for low motion blur. I used it for a week, and it felt weird.  Yes, there was less motion blur, but the colors were way off with it on.  Everything had a purple tint to it, and the strobe effect can give you a headache (plus alt+tabbing out of a game takes longer because lightboost is only active ingame IIRC and therefore has to switch back to normal)Also keep in mind that you will probably encounter a few issues running a 60hz monitor alongside this.  At least with Windows 7 (I hear 8.1 fixed this but I don't know myself) if you move a window from your 144hz monitor to your 60hz, it'll stutter around until you drop it on one monitor and pick it up again.I don't consider these cons because it isn't the monitor's fault.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beautiful,2014-11-29,"Pros:- Great value for a 24"" 144 Hz monitor- Fast response time- 3D capable- Color accuracy is good enough for 99% of users. (If you are a professional image/video editor, you'll need more than this 6-bit panel can deliver. I'm satisfied watching HD movies on this, but just make sure you follow the calibration tips from tom's hardware.)","Cons:- I only ordered one.- It is a TN display so there's some limitations to the viewing angle.- Speakers are laughably bad. I'd rather they didn't include them than include these tin cans.- Out-of-box calibration could be better, but it's still pretty good.","Other Thoughts:Just note: HDMI does not support higher refresh rates so if you plan on taking advantage of the higher refresh rates, you need to use the dual-link DVI or display port for the higher rates.  So if you are stuck with HDMI (laptop users), you will not be able to take advantage of the higher refresh rate.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,GREAT...when it works...,2014-11-29,"Pros:●144 Hz refresh is clearly evident over any other screen I've used with lesser refresh rates!●Decent button placement and tactile feel●The OSD is pretty easy to navigate and doesn't feel like any options are unnecessarily hard to find●Out-of-box colors are alright.  Found a good ICM profile and suggested settings on Reddit-- much happier until I can get around to any more true calibration.●Native DisplayPort-- a MUST for Eyefinity and AMD cards●Very easy to adjust in height, tilt, and rotation (at the base)●No dead pixels from any of the three screens I bought","Cons:●First screen I ordered on 2014-09-30 died (no power) exactly 60 days later on 2014-11-29.  Went to press the power button and no LED (blue nor red).  -1 Egg●Overall mounting solution to the base stand is good, but it's just a tad too sensitive to wobbling.  Typing this review on my keyboard, I can see the screen shake ever so slightly.●Be prepared for the panel lottery if you buy multiples of these.  One out of my three has a LOT of light bleed around the entire perimeter and is clearly brighter overall than its siblings even at the same ICM and OSD settings.●DVI and power cable lengths are a joke-- like 3' long.  Couldn't use the monitors with my setup until I ordered 10' cables.  Be aware of this and make sure you have long enough cables before you order these in case you have to add longer ones to your cart.","Other Thoughts:Just filed the RMA with ASUS for the first bad screen that went dead.  Very disappointed because it happened the day I received my two other screens to do a 3x1 Eyefinity.I think these are worth the $289 they're normally charged, truly I do, even with this bad egg (no pun intended).  Scored the other two from the massive discount on Black Friday.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Never going back to 60Hz again!!!,2014-11-29,Pros:- Very fluid 144hz- 1ms response time (grey to grey)- Great in game picture quality- No screen tearing- Perfect size for game concentration and taking screen information- Smooth and easy height adjustment- Rotatable to portrait mode,"Cons:- Desktop color reproduction is not as great as IPS panels or for that matter, the previous TV I was using as my monitor.","Other Thoughts:Desktop color reproduction aside, the colors in game are awesome, and as far as I can tell, provide more detail. Gameplay is ultra smooth and I have not encountered any screen tearing.If you're a gamer, and you have the GPU power to push games past 60FPS, then you owe it to yourself to get this monitor. At the current price, it's easily justifiable.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Perfect monitor!,2014-11-28,"Pros:There isn't a single thing I hate about this monitor; the colours are spot on, adjusts in every way possibly, great pixel density, low response time, 24"" feels perfect to me.I highly recommend this monitor for anybody looking at getting a 1080p display. Can't say enough good things about it.","Cons:Absolutely none, it's perfect.",,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor! Lives up to its hype!,2014-11-28,Pros:-Colors are great once you apply it with an ICC profile and adjust it from the menu. Those who are complaining about it are not  really researching thoroughly to find a solution. When you fix it should  look just as a good as any other panel.-Once you experience 144hz it is very difficult to revert back to a lower frequency.-The stand is very ergonomic which is convenient.,Cons:None as of yet.,"Other Thoughts:As stated earlier, if you search the web for a fix with an ICC profile you should have no issues with the colors.  Follow the steps accordingly and you should be fine.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"As advertised, everything turned out great.",2014-11-28,"Pros:-Colors are great especially with a custom ICC profile.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Amazing monitor, poor colour.",2014-11-27,Pros:144hzLightboost hack makes this amazing,"Cons:Poor color representationEven worse with Lightboost hack enabled on it (everything is purpley but its not a big deal, you get used to it)","Other Thoughts:This was worth the purchase for the simple fact that with lightboost hack, at 120hz, this thing is more fluid than straight up 144hz.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Bomb For FPS Games.,2014-11-26,Pros:This thing is awesome.I run it in 120hz 2d light boost mode and it has the motion clarity of a CRT monitor. Super Smooth.I use this to play BF4 and CS:GO.Your K/D will improve if you are good at FPS games.,"Cons:Colors arnt perfect and viewing angle is bad, but thats to be expected from a TN panel.You need powerful graphics hardware to run games at 120fps+I bought a second 670 just for bf4 at 120fps+",,1,1

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Best Monitor I have owned,2014-11-21,"Pros:Vibrant colors.Worked great with good colors out of box. Did not need to adjust anything. Only adjustments I make is changing modes for various games/movies.Stand swivel is a cool feature if you move your monitor side to side often.Amazing with games, especially when you can get your FPS over 60(around 100 or higher is where I like it)",Cons:Stand puts monitor too far forward. I am a fan of having my monitor about 3 -4 feet away from me and the stand puts the monitor pretty far forward compared to other monitors I have had. My monitor is about 2ft 5in away from me at the back of my desk against the wall.I personally will have to get a wall mount for it to get it closer to the 3 foot mark.,"Other Thoughts:I have had this for over 3 months now and am waiting for the next good sale to get another 2 of these to have a 3 monitor setup with these. Of course, I will personally need some wall mounts for those, but such a minor thing for such a great monitor. I will make the sacrifice and spend extra on a wall mount to get this monitor again as I am so happy with the monitors colors and performance.",4,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Amazing monitors even without G-Sync,2014-11-16,"Pros:Great colors, easy to adjust, VESA mounts, Display Port input, speakers included",Cons:No G-Sync out of the box,"Other Thoughts:I bought three of these monitors for a racing setup. The difference it makes going from 60Hz to 144Hz for these type of games is amazing. I was disappointed to not have G-Sync out of the box, but for the price it cant be beaten. There is a G-Sync kit that comes for these monitors, but its sold separately and requires some knowledge to  disassemble the monitor to install it.",4,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,144hz will blow you away!,2014-11-14,"Pros:If you on the edge of buying this monitor because you're not sure you'll see a difference between 60hz and 144hz, let me tell you there's a difference. Not a small one either.  It's nice seeing your mouse move buttery smooth over the desktop, but once you take this monitor into a game, woo-wee does it shine! It's difficult to explain the experience, but it's amazing","Cons:Colors are a bit washed out, but once you get this monitor I recommend you check out this post on PCMR to make the monitor look great! http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1wxse9/just_bought_a_glorious_asus_vg248qe_gaming/",Other Thoughts:Make sure to use a connection that supports 144hz.I would use the Dual Link DVI cable that comes in the box.,41,2

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Flawed,2014-11-11,Pros:The monitor itself looks good.,"Cons:If you plan on hooking any device to this thing other than a computer, don't even bother if you want halfway decent sound. The headphone jack on this thing is absolutely worthless. When you first plug in, sound is normal, then within 5 seconds it degrades itself as if it's turning the treble all the way down on its own. I've contacted Asus already and they instructed me to send it back to the reseller (in this case, Newegg) Well, here I am with my RMA replacement monitor and guess what. SAME ISSUE. I've tried the headphone jack with multiple devices, and again..same issue.","Other Thoughts:This has been nothing but a headache. I understand, audio is just one feature, likely tacked on, however if I'm going to pay $280 I expect the thing to work properly.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best monitor I've seen...,2014-11-07,Pros:144hz with 1ms makes video games look and feel great!Does not have any dead pixels so far.No color bleed or any light glow.,"Cons:None so far, kinda wished that it had physical volume buttons but I'm planning to get better speakers anyway.","Other Thoughts:I was still learning about refresh hz and monitors, but I found out after a day that I was supposed to use DVI instead of HDMI in order to use 144hz which never showed up on the settings. I facepalmed myself after reading the manual...I love this monitor... Thanks Asus!",6,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,This monitor is amazing!,2014-11-03,"Pros:144mhz refresh rate, 1080 resilution, swivels all kinds of directions, matches my build with its red and black color scheme.","Cons:the shiny base collects dust really easy, and I don't care for the huge 3d logo on the base but these two things are nit picky really.",Other Thoughts:Some people will complain that it is TN and not IPS so the colors are not as true and vibrant but for me I didn't buy this for that reason that and this is 10 times better than my previous monitor.  Also this is for gaming not trying to edit high res pictures.,3,2

ASUS,VG278Q,3,Overall an amazing product and a great buy for the price -- especially if you can't find/afford the epic ASUS ROG 144hz 27incher. ^^;;;.....,2014-11-02,"Pros:Vibrant Theater and Game modes that make games feel a lot more lively. 6 presets to choose from, each with independent (built-in) calibration memory. Can be VERY bright and colorful (read cons.). All  adjustments imaginable are possible in this $300, 144hz, 1080p, G-Sync-capable monitor !!!!...... Great design overall (read cons.). Amazing gaming experience, (whoever says there is no difference is a total schnubble. Having been gaming for 20 years, and played through the Quake 3 300FPS+ days, I would kill for a 240hz CRT, if they weren't mostly buried in landfills nowadays.), and very nice for general desktop usage too. Multi-monitor capable while maintaining full 144hz operation. 3D capable. Colors are decent enough for basic video/photo editing. (though I've never seen a 10-bit, Adobe RGB monitor with my own eyes, so I can't really compare.)","Cons:Colors are WAY too bright out of the box, and will have to be tuned manually. (for general, every day use, I suggest Standard mode with calibrated colors through a tool such as the Windows built-in calibrator plus the monitor OSD. switch to Theater Mode and Game Mode when it's time to kick --- and chew bubblegum.) No direct volume control, a really annoying ""boot"" screen when turning on, and a really difficult to access headphones plug crack some eggs to the floor, as minor details as they may be - they could definitely have been looked after. Only pivots one way, which makes the controls kind of awkard to reach (for me.). G-Sync capable yes, but not by default, and it seems complicated and expensive to go through the process. But I won't be removing any extra eggs for that. 144hz is plenty enough basically anyway. Can't seem to get LightStrobe to work for this (or I can't notice the difference, or I'm just dumb maybe, I dunno. ;).....). Bright (blue) pixel after 6 weeks of usage - worked perfectly before that. D:..... Text can be a bit hard to read sometimes. (I've tried tuning ClearType but it doesn't seem to change anything.) Doesn't match inch-for-an-inch in resolution (10 inches in Photoshop appears as 7 real-world inches.), which can be annoying.","Other Thoughts:Still thinking of getting a bunch more of these for a multi-monitor setup, especially since the ROGs are absolutely out of reach for Canadians. (I would unfortunately probably trade many-more-% more pixels for built-in G-Sync and a still decent 25x14 resolution.) Also considering the G-Sync boards, eventually..... Overall, I would say ----- GET IT - the flaws are pretty minor mostly, and can indeed mostly be corrected - apart from the fairly large bezels, lol !!..... You will not be regretting the buy, for 300 dollars.",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,I want another one.,2014-10-30,Pros:Its big. Has built in speakers and also has HDMI connections so you can use it as a small TV for your Xbone or your PS4 when your at a buddys. It also has a great base and swivels very nicely easy to center on your desk and turn it so others can see if need be.,Cons:Speakers arent all that loud there loud but if you have a window A/C unite near by your desk it becomes kind of hard to hear.Also it doesnt let me see the future.,Other Thoughts:I will defently be buying another one when the time comes I can aquire another one. Its a great monitor and looks really good just about any where you put it on your desk.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beautiful Form and Function,2014-10-30,"Pros:FAST response time, 144Hz, Bright, Stylish and amazing stand. Orients landscape or portrait. Solid construction.","Cons:The second one I bought came with a stubborn stuck pixel (red). Filed an RMA and took care of it. The included DVI cable is slightly shorter than I'd have liked, but neither issue is worth losing an egg.","Other Thoughts:These things are fantastic. They're solid and of course the specs are great, but the stand is the unsung hero. It has a built in swivel of about 70 degrees, and raises up quite a ways (and holds well). Additionally, it has two locking positions if you enjoy vertical orientation. The red plastic cord guide in the back is a useful feature as well. This monitor is worth full price, but if it comes on sale it's a steal. I have two of these side-by-side and couldn't be happier. Probably won't be moving away from these on my main setup until I make the jump to 4k.",2,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,10/10 would buy again,2014-10-27,Pros:The overall performance was instantly better than my previous monitor. The moment I enabled 144hz and dragged the control panel window across the screen it had a quick and smooth look. I previously had lots of screen tearing in games and I have not seen any yet even without v-sync.,Cons:The crosshair  feature is not that great. I wish there was more options on the size and color of the crosshair.,Other Thoughts:Fantastic Monitor with some cool features and I would highly recommend this to a friend!,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent Monitor,2014-10-25,"Pros:Large screen(well, it's not huge but 24"" is more than enough for me) with low response time.  I'm running it with a GT 640 for the time being and it runs very smoothly at full resolution in the games I have played(Borderlands Pre Sequel, Sid Meier's Beyond Earth, and others).The price is probably the biggest plus.  It's a fairly large monitor, low latency, high  contrast, does 3D, pivots, tilts, and raises/lowers.  For gaming purposes, I'm not sure what else you need.  I'm definitely going to buy a second one in a few months.","Cons:None worth removing an egg.  It's like it really *wants* to have high brightness and high saturation, but through calibration you can get both to more appropriate levels.Also, the power cable that comes with it seems really short.  I needed to go digging through my spare PC parts to find a longer one.  My surge protector is off to one side of my desk, which just happens to be the opposite side of the desk where this monitor sits.  Just a minor inconvenience though.","Other Thoughts:Colors are a *bit* of a problem.  Most of them are fine.  Other people have mentioned blues and reds but my problem areas seem to be the transitions from green->yellow and green->cyan.  I have tried calibrating for a few minutes and have improved from the default settings, but it's not quite perfect.  That said, it's not bad  enough to be a con or worth an egg.  And the calibration settings are plentiful.  I'm sure with some more fiddling I'll get everything in order.I haven't tried 3D yet since I don't have the glasses(will get those after Christmas).I haven't tried the speakers at  all since I have a separate stereo system.

ASUS,VG278Q,3,Hideous Colors,2014-10-22,Pros:-144hz works just as it should-Lightboost works (if you know how to enable it)-Cant argue with the cost-Great stand (90degree rotatable)-Amazing response time,Cons:-The ugliest colors on a monitor I have ever seen,"Other Thoughts:You may be thinking, ""how can one con take two eggs away from a review?"" Well, when talking about a monitor, colors matter. My old monitor was the 8 Year Old Asus MK241 and it absolutely stomps this new monitor colorwise.Honestly, I have tried all the presets suggested by monitor review but I have come to conclusion that no the closest I can get is still not good enough. I think this may be related to the fact that is a 3D ready monitor.Either way, If you buy this for 144hz, you're making a good choice. If you want your reds to look red and your blues to look look... look for a different monitor.",2,6
ASUS,VG278Q,5,There is a reason this monitor is a best seller,2014-10-20,"Pros:What a beautiful display! This monitor has no dead or stuck pixles. 144Hz is amazing for any game espically FPS games, it gives super smooth motion. For people who say the human eye cant tell the difference between 60Hz and 144Hz, you definately can tell the difference.On a side note, I ordered this on a Friday and recieved it the following Monday. Used Eggsaver shipping method. Thanks Newegg!!",Cons:Wasn't free.,"Other Thoughts:As others have said, this monitor comes from the factory with the brightness set to 90 which is way too high. For people who complain about the colors; any monitor anybody buys needs to be properly calibrated. With out proper calibration no monitor looks good. I have yet to buy a monitor that comes straight out of the box calibrated. If you are looking for a monitor to professionally edit photographs, this is not the monitor for you. If you are a true gamer and want the advantage in game, buy this monitor you won't regret it.",4,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,No Regrets,2014-10-17,"Pros:Let me start by saying I love this monitor!-Excellent brightness.-Incredibly fluid motion on 144hz.-24"" seems to be the perfect size for gaming (for me).-Headphone pass-through.-Adjustable stand.-Portrait mode (this is also handy for connecting audio/video cables).-The colors on mine looked good when I first hooked it up. I think ASUS may be calibrating these better from the factory now. Or I could just be colorblind. I suppose I could say the colors looked a tad washed out on the default settings, but I think that was probably more a result of how bright the screen is. In any case, I don't think they look nearly as bad as other reviews state (at least mine didn't).-Matte finish on panel makes reflection and glare a non-issue.-No bleeding or bright spots; brightness and colors look uniform across the panel.-Comes with DVI cable.You will be amazed at the beauty of this monitor.","Cons:-Integral Speakers are abysmal. My eMachines monitor had better speakers, but I shouldn't be using integral speakers anyway.-No lock on adjustable stand. This can cause the panel to slide around a lot when transporting.-When switching to portrait mode, it's possible to scratch/scuff the stand base if the panel isn't fully raised.","Other Thoughts:Honestly, 144Hz didn't blow me away when I first got this monitor hooked up. But it has made me considerably better at Battlefield 4. I'm now consistently going positive. I even did better when playing Halo 4 when I hooked up my Xbox 360 to it; even though the frame rate is not even close to 144 fps, I believe the 1ms response time still helps on consoles. There's noticeable input lag when I play on my TV from 2008.I would compare 144hz to using a mechanical keyboard: you don't really notice how much better it is until you try to go without it.One thing to consider is that you will have a constant dilemma of turning your graphics settings down to get 120+ fps (unless you have an awesome graphics card).Also remember that only DVI and DisplayPort can run this monitor at 144Hz. So HDMI is really only useful for consoles and DVD/bluray players.I tried the lightboost hack, and I really couldn't tell much of a difference even at 144fps. It is neat that ASUS officially supports this lightboost hack on the new 27"" version of this monitor (ULMB is what they call it).One feature I didn't know I'd like is the pass through for headphones. When I plug my headphones directly into my PC, there is sometimes a humming, buzzing, or hissing sound. This also is present if I use the SPDIF cable to connect to the monitor audio. However, if I use the audio through displayport and then plug my headphones into the monitor, there is no buzzing. The trade-off is that the audio sounds a bit muddier.I upgraded from a 20"" 1600x900 60Hz E202H eMachines monitor that I've had for 5 years. There's no comparison. The extra size, brightness, resolution, and refresh rate make all the difference.In short, this monitor isn't technically perfect, but it's very close, especially for the price. This is the best $250 I've spent in a long time.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,"Really nice monitor, but...",2014-10-16,"Pros:This monitor is great. Has no cons, i really enjoy it but there is one problem, a tiny bug somehow got behind the LCD screen and died and now i have a 1mm sized black dot on my screen.","Cons:Like i said. I was fortunate enough to have an insect crawl under the LCD screen and die. It is impossible to remove without me breaking the whole monitor. I don't know if i am eligible for RMA because of this incident. I love this monitor, i really do but how unlucky can you be to have a bug get inside of your screen and die right near the center...","Other Thoughts:Bugs aside. this monitor was fantastic, now its just giving me anxiety because i know i cant afford another one and that dead bug is driving me insane. I cant stop noticing it.",0,2

ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2014-10-13,"Pros:Read a lot of reviews before purchasing. There were a lot of people complaining about the poor color quality. Frankly, I don't know what they're talking about.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2014-10-09,"Pros:I have experienced a great refresh rate.  The colors are realistic.  It rotates, in case I want to see the screen in portrait mode.",Cons:I personally don't like that the buttons are on the bottom edge of the monitor.  I would prefer them to be up front.,Other Thoughts:The other monitor for my consideration was one from the company that many consider the best LCD manufacturer.  This Asus has more features than anything from that company.  I don't regret choosing this model.,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Requires calibration, but looks great.",2014-10-08,"Pros:No dead pixels and looks good after proper calibration. The stand allows you to rotate the monitor easily 90 degrees clockwise into portrait. Also sits on a nice lazy susan to turn left and right. Viewing angles are decent, looking it from below looks bad but is still easy to discern what is on screen.The menu buttons feel decent and in general feels like a very solid products.","Cons:Required large calibration and using a windows calibration setting I found from other reviews. Im not sure if you could calibrate it correctly for anything not connected to a PC. After all the settings though it looks great, yellow might be a little off but I use f.lux which make everything orange anyways which might be throwing me off on what is actually normal.The monitor is BRIGHT! It came factory at 90 brightness and I immediately turned it down to 35. It is still very bright at night at that setting so I have turned f.lux up like mad to try and save my eyes at night in a dark room.","Other Thoughts:Normally I wouldn't be happy about the blue lit power button but from normal viewing height you can't see it, and if the monitor is on, it way outshines the blue light because it is a crazy bright monitor.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Light bleed spots,2014-10-07,Pros:It arrived?,"Cons:Day one there's a nasty back bleed splotch. Normally backbleed occurs around the corners of the monitor, but sadly, this was a blotch right in the left side of my monitor. Very visible. Very dissapointing.","Other Thoughts:Very washed out when I received it. I guess with some calibration it could be good. But sadly, the defect is too noticeable.Here's to hoping the turn around for RMA is acceptable.",1,7
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing monitor!,2014-10-07,Pros:Super smooth graphics. Cool gaming settings. Just the right size. 1080p looks fantastic.,Cons:Colors are a little off sometimes.,Other Thoughts:Buy this monitor for gaming. You will not regret it.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,One of the best monitors out there,2014-10-07,Pros:- 144hz @ 1080p as advertised.- Incredible brightness and contrast ratio settings available.- Noticeably low input lag (other review sites confirm this in benchmarks)- The price is phenominal for what you are getting.,Cons:There's absolutely nothing I can complain about this product.,"Other Thoughts:I've had this monitor for over a year now, and there's a reason why it continues to be the best-selling and top-rated monitors on the market.If there is one 144hz, 1080p monitor that you need for gaming, look no further.Only extra comment I can make is that make sure your GPU can handle high FPS at 144hz otherwise you will get some awkward stutter.",1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Triple Rocks!,2014-10-06,"Pros:I bought 3 of these monitors to complete a rock solid gaming rig. The 1 ms response time, coupled with the 144 Hz refresh rate, make gaming better than normal.Make sure to download and use a color profile, as the default color is not the best.I was gaming with a 29"" ultrawide monitor, which was nice. But these 3 monitors give you so much peripheral vision in games, its wild.This is the monitor that nVidia uses for the G Sync mod. Not sure if I'll go that route, but its interesting.","Cons:The only con, and its small, is the the back of the monitor is covered with plastic. The problem is that it is also underneath the area where the stand is attached. So you need to detach the stand to get all of the plastic wrap off.. Like I said, not that bad.","Other Thoughts:I watched a lot of reviews before buying this monitor, and it was well worth it.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,LOVE!!!!,2014-10-06,"Pros:I absolutely love my ASUS 24"" Monitor. I have been about to use it for everything and it has given me great satisfaction!

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor!,2014-10-05,"Pros:Refresh Rate!  144hz or 120hz light boosted?  Yes please!  Coming from a 60hz monitor, this is amazing.  I play a lot of Counter-Strike Global Offensive and I definitely notice the difference.Solid stand.  Feels sturdy and is easily adjustable.",Cons:Not perfect right out of the box.  You'll need to find the right color profile for this monitor and do some settings adjustments to make it look better.  Not really a big deal.,"Other Thoughts:I used to use a 27"" monitor as my main monitor.  Now I use this as my main monitor.  I thought it would be upsetting losing that much screen real estate, but it's not bad at all.  I got used to it quickly.  It also helps that I was able to replace an older 22"" monitor with the 27"" monitor to keep it in my 3 monitor setup.I've got a 27"" 60 hz on the left, this 144hz beauty in the middle, and a 22"" 60hz on the right.  Of the three, this one has the best tech specs, the best stand, and the best look.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Just wow..,2014-10-03,"Pros:144 Hz is such a significant jump from a standard 60 Hz monitor. I was skeptical at first, and was debating between this 24"" @ 144 Hz or a 27"" @ 60 Hz. I made the right choice. Games are liquid smooth, even when running at lower framerates. You will really be able to tell the difference, and after going 144 Hz it is difficult to return to a 60 Hz display.Apart from the 144 Hz, the monitor itself is gorgeous. The stand is solid and well-designed.","Cons:Bezel of the monitor itself is thick, not thick enough to knock off an egg.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is the center display in my triple-header setup. The outer two monitors are 23.5"" ASUS 60 Hz monitors.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Incredible,2014-10-03,"Pros:The 144hz makes a difference. Things look incredible and games look almost so real it make you feel immersed. Playing any game on these monitors are a treat, and the colors and settings are great.",Cons:Color saturation is hard to change to look normal. Screen is extremely bright and colors are off. So you will need to change a few settings. After you do it looks just beautiful.,"Other Thoughts:I have owned it for a month or two now and I am glad I chose this monitor. The only downside that I see now is that I will need more. The price is solid and fair, yet the quality is still incredible.",0,0

Smooth lines and very nice screen.This is a great monitor and beautiful picture once I got it where I wanted it,Cons:Not really a con but yes it takes a little time to adjust the settings to your liking but with all monitors you will always have to adjust them for perception is different for everyone.,"Other Thoughts:As I read in a review here, to get the 144hz you need to use the DVI cable that comes with it, use the correct DVI port on you GPU then restart your PC and when you get back in you can go to the display section>screen resolution and the 144hz will show up there. will not work with the HDMI just the DVI or displayport",0,0

This is also true of the second monitor except its more top left. The other monitor looks amazing in the bottom right where there is no hue to it.As for the 144hz refresh....

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Unreal,2014-09-28,"Pros:First off, Ive had this monitor for about 3 weeks now and I have to say, I can never, ever go back to having a standard 60hz monitor. I had initially hesitated because of reading some negative comments about colour/picture quality, but honestly, the default settings were great.- Installed an excellent ICC Profile* for the monitor which makes it absolutely incredible (For people who complain about pic quality or potentially washed out colours-144hz (or even 120hz) is absolutely a huge game changer in the world of gaming and even just regular computer usage. It makes transitioning pictures/video seem so much more fluid and there isn't any noticeable motion blur (this is especially the case in FPS games)- Sleek design- Bezel is not too thick- Supports DVI, HDMI, Displayport- Stand is firm and the monitor does not wobble","Cons:Some cons include:- Default brightness of the monitor is incredibly bright, but playing with settings and installing an ICC Profile can fix that easily- Connecting cables can be a hassle as the ports are vertically placed on the mointor and not horizontal- Only a 24"" monitor (I personally would have loved a somewhat larger size, but this is only preference)","Other Thoughts:* To configure an excellent set-up for the monitor use these settings:Splendid Mode: StandardContrast: 80Brightness: 35Color Temp: User *RGB: Red 96 / Green 94 / Blue 88-> Then proceed to the TFTCentral website and download the specific ICC profile for the monitor (Unfortunately cannot use include links in comments)All in all, an excellent monitor and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who's been eyeing the monitor for purchase",11,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Very Nice,2014-09-25,"Pros:Sleek design, very ergonomic. 144hz is a MUST for the hardcore gamer",Cons:Not good picture quality. You will be disappointed.,Other Thoughts:I bought the VX248H model and had used it untill i realized the power of the 144hz (Avid gamer here). Sent it back for this one. I had both monitors hooked up side by side before i sent the first back. The picture quality difference is night and day. You can download fixes for it but its still not perfect. If i hadn't bought it to play games i would flashback to the 60hz model. This is a great design TN panel but the messed up the picture quality. Personally i would look into the BENQs even though they are more expensive,0,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,The First G-SYNC,2014-09-24,"Pros:This was a great performing monitor right out of the box.  The color scheme was off though, the yellows and greens looked neon.  This was actually a neat feature in games and allowed you to see opponents quickly.This is the monitor that the G-SYNC kit by NVIDIA is sold for.",Cons:Installing the separately sold G-SYNC kit is not for the faint of heart.,"Other Thoughts:I bought the G-SYNC upgrade kit from NVIDIA and installed it on this monitor.  I am still using it a year later over a larger 27"" 144Mhz monitor I also own.  The installation was a little tricky.  I crushed the bezel a little taking it apart.  I also could not get the front connector ribbon into the motherboard correctly and wound up shearing the connector right off the motherboard leaving it hanging by strings.  Nevertheless, it works fine.  I don't have a functional on off switch, but it is default on always anyway.  G-SYNC is awesome and I'm never going back.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing!,2014-09-21,"Pros:The 144hz is incredible.  After gaming and using Windows on 144hz for well over a month now, I reverted back to 60hz for games and other Windows applications to see the difference.  60hz looks awful and I'm not sure how I got by before I purchased this screen.I'm also baffled at the amount of reviews on here complaining about the washed out colors.  I haven't even had to bother with the OSD settings or my video card settings to calibrate colors.  I think it looks fantastic.","Cons:Having to go to work and use a 60hz monitor, or playing a console video game on a TV that uses 60hz.  Seriously, I can't believe how 144hz makes 60hz looks so bad.  I wish I could use this monitor for everything from here on out.","Other Thoughts:Don't think twice while considering this purchase!

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing Monitor,2014-09-20,Pros:I love this monitor. Games look like an absolute dream on it. The reduced motion blur makes games look like they are in a higher definition than 1080p. League at 144 fps is wonderful. I find myself playing games a lot now just for the eye candy. I never want to game on anything less now. Something as simple as watching your characters move is great. It's just liquid and crystal clear. At some points in games I seriously think I'm watching a movie by pixar or dreamworks because it looks so good. Like in Dota 2. There are moments I forget I'm playing a game.The articulation on the stand is pretty good and easily adjustable.Comes with DVI cable and audio cable.,"Cons:When I got my product there were light scratches all around the edge of the monitor which didn't hinder the functionality at all (So I won't dock an egg as the monitor is an amazing monitor.) but I remember thinking ""That's really disappointing to see for a brand new product."" I thought they were smudges at first and tried to rub it down and they wouldn't come off. I just remembered it hurting my soul a little and felt it was worth mentioning.",Other Thoughts:I remember thinking the sound on the monitor was way too quite but that was before I found out how to turn up the volume. Now it's decent but most people are going to use their own speakers anyway.Make sure your DVI cable is in the correct DVI port on your video card IF your video card has a single and dual link slot. A I got frustrated for a little bit because I wasn't getting the 144Hz option. That's because (Being me) seeing that it was a single link DVI cable put it in the single link slot on my HIS 6950 and therefore wasn't getting the option. After some Googling I just switched ports and it was working fine.The 144Hz option is NOT automatically enabled. I feel like that gets said enough so that people she know but I am willing to bet there is at least one individual doing it wrong. Install the drivers and make sure the DVI is in the correct slot (If your using the DVI that is). Then right click on your desktop > screen resolution > advanced settings > monitor tab > screen refresh rate drop down bar and make your selection.,1,0

The base rotates and every adjustment is smooth and takes just a touch but it still gives you the feel of how sturdy it is.-There is a nice slot in the back that sticks out approximately 1 inch for wire management.","Cons:-Similar to other reviews, I agree the color needs adjusted. I was weary of this prior to purchase but like i said in the pros section, the menu is easy to navigate and adjust so I am not disappointed by this but you must complete this action to get the best picture-I had difficulty being able to maneuver the DVI cable to plug it into the back of the monitor. the outlet is in an odd position. I resolved this by putting the monitor in portrait mode and I was able to get a better angle.-The base of the monitor (the portion that rotates) has an ugly, white, cube shaped, 3D logo that I would not have put there had I been given an option but it is not a sticker and I believe it would scratch the surface if an attempt was made to remove it.I do not believe these cons take away from the value/quality of the monitor so I did not remove any eggs.","Other Thoughts:If I had to do over, I would buy this exact monitor again. I actually plan on buying another in the near future",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Nice screen,2014-09-09,Pros:Very happy with this screen.  Beautiful display and 144 hz rocks!  Just remember that you have to change it from the default 60 hz in device manager.,Cons:It is REALLY bright out of the box.  Found some optimal settings online now it looks great.  The blacks could be blacker.,Other Thoughts:In my new build I installed a R9 290 video card and wanted a screen that could be driven over 60 fps.  I am not disappointed.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Felt like a GPU upgrade with the new smoothness,2014-09-09,"Pros:Everything displays very smoothly, given that it is a 144hz monitor. Almost felt as if my GPU was upgraded somehow. I had to do some tweaking on the colors and settings so it didn't look so washed out but it looks pretty good now. It's light and easy to move and the DVI-D cable that came with it is a nice length too. Speakers aren't that great but who buys a monitor for its speakers anyway.","Cons:Not a 'con' of the product itself, but more about the one I received. The bottom right of my screen has some wavy lines that don't go away. I can only really see them if I'm trying to display something dark in that corner so it's no big deal. Still, would be nice if they weren't there. Not going to dock an egg seeing that it was probably the fault of transportation or maybe I just don't have the thing plugged in right or something.",,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Experience from Singapore,2014-09-07,"Pros:The shipping took 5 business days, within the 4-5 indicated. It was shipped via UPS and the tracking number updates are reliable. As this is an open box item, box was slightly damaged and already repaired with tape. Item seems perfect, no dead pixels, no missing DVI dual link cable, manuals and so on. All in all, open box item is worth it. Bought it at US$215.99 and new egg saver shipping to Singapore US$86.13. It is much cheaper than Singapore retailers and what irks me is despite selling more expensive, Singapore retailers have poor customer service.Power consumption is max at 35.7W. Usually 31.5W. I tried BF4 with GTX 770 2GB 144Hz and it looks smoother than 60Hz.As I am still waiting for my Nvidia 3D Vision 2 kit to arrive, I will reserve my comments for the rest.","Cons:The screen is bright, colors natural when switched on but do not expect viewing angles and colors as good as IPS. My Dell 21.5"" touchscreen IPS looks nicer but it is only 60Hz.",,0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,2,ASUS VG248QE 3 Dead pixels,2014-09-04,Pros:performs grate big diff over 60hz don't think i could go back.,Cons:was waiting for it like a little kid at xmas when i got it all set up powered it on and 3 dead pixels on the upper right side of the screen very frustrating.,,0,4
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2014-09-04,"Pros:Great view, cheater crosshair, great clarity, adjustable stand, 3d(if you love that gimmick), 144 Hz which provides a very smooth image while playing FPS, overall, one of the best monitors I've ever owned. If you ever plan on getting a 27 inch, I downsized because the view area was too large for me. I highly recommend this monitor for FPS games.",Cons:The stand sometimes unadjusts every so often I have to push it back up.,Other Thoughts:Much cheaper then benq's monitor and better warranty,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Will interfere with your Wifi Router,2014-09-01,Pros:It's got a lot of landscape.  It's bright.  Haven't tried 3D yet.  At least it doesn't interfere with the 5 Ghz wifi radio band.,Cons:This think generates a ton of radio frequency interference.  I used to have my old monitor close to my wifi router and had no problems.  This monitor created tons of interference and my 2.4 Ghz wifi band was completely disrupted and useless.  It took me months to figure out what the source of the interference was.  Don't place this monitor anywhere near a wifi router.  I even tried a different wifi router and wifi adapters.,Other Thoughts:I am kinda shocked that it wasn't shielded better for what I paid for it.,1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Asus VG248QE,2014-08-31,Pros:I love this monitor! It has been stable and reliable for over 1 year. It takes a little time to adjust the color to your liking.Stock settings need some help.  There are some profiles available online that help a little. It is a bright monitor!!Not a problem for me. The stand height is adjustable too.,Cons:No cons to speak of.,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Terrible Colors,2014-08-30,Pros:144hzGreat build qualityStand is wonderful,"Cons:Color.This monitor is washed out. The colors are all dull and off. You'd expect it with a TN panel, but this monitor really stands out. I've done ever calibration that people claim ""makes it beautiful"" and have seen the changes, but the quality is still extremely low. Colors are too dark as well.If you are looking for Color, this is not what you want.I thought ""the color can't be that bad"", but I can hardly stand to look at the thing because of it.,",,5,7
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best monitor for the money,2014-08-30,Pros:Picture quality is phenomenal. It has all the features you would expect with monitor's outside most peoples budget. Looks great! Best gaming monitor I have ever owned. I am about to buy another one to go dual monitor.,"Cons:Occasionally when I play my ps4 I need to adjust the volume. Getting to the settings to change the volume is easy, it just requires pressing to many buttons for my liking. I'm getting a 5.1 speaker system however so this minor nuisance will be obsolete.",Other Thoughts:If you are sill hesitant and don't need a monitor right away wait for holidays or specials that newegg has all the time. This has been a featured product multiple times and you can get it even cheaper than it already is.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Very Nice!,2014-08-30,"Pros:Very nice monitor for gaming or just watching movies. I was using a 22"" TV as a monitor for awhile and after a power surge I decided to upgrade. Very customizable.",Cons:I got a monitor with a stuck pixel smack dab in the middle of the screen. Fortunately I'm getting it replaced. Other than that I love it.,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,"Good when they work, bad when display port stops working",2014-08-29,"Pros:Looks good, Love the refresh rate, Ordered for a 6 Monitor setup","Cons:So I bought 6 of these during the last big sale they had on them, and I had to RMA 2 of them within a week of ordering.and now one of the RMA's is now having a displayport issue. What happens is i'll get catalsy pop ups saying something went wrong with the displayport or connection and the link basically failed. this will happen off and on until the display port on the monitor finally dies. I'll then switch to DVI which will last for abit until that starts having issues and then stops working completely or whenever it feels like it.I'm now down to 1 Main and 1 RMA Displayport down monitor, 2 of the others I've moved to other systems and put them on DVI for fear of going bad and 1 RMA is still setting in box as a spare.","Other Thoughts:Now I'm wondering if maybe this Video card I have maybe causing the issue but I just cant see how the Vid card could be doing that. Vid card is an Asus 6970 DC2 3 Slotter. You would think their own product would work with their own. and yes I've messed with the switch aswell for the Dual Link.I've also looked onlilne and found lots of other threads on forums and people posting having the same issue with the display port just failing after some use and then monitor taking a dump so my guess is just a bad batch could also be why price has come down. cause I bought 4 others when these 1st came out at $500 and they are still going strong, maybe they decided to go cheap I don't know but this sucks caus ei cant RMA anylonger due to 30day time frame and I'm sure newegg won't let me just keep rmaing faulty products.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Butter Smooth!,2014-08-27,"Pros:Have had this monitor for over a year now and still love everything about it!  Many of my friends didn't believe that anything above 60hz is noticeable, but after giving them a demo of this monitor next to a typical 60hz monitor, they are believers.  I have this paired with a Radeon HD7970 (which are dirt cheap used online right now) and it is a great combination.  Highly recommend this to anyone.","Cons:None really, price is great compared to other options","Other Thoughts:If you don't notice a difference right away, make sure that the DVI-D cable is being used and if you are in windows 7, make sure to go to ""screen resolution"", select the monitor and then click ""Advanced Settings"" and under the monitor tab, make sure that 144hz is selected from the drop down menu.  This happened to me and made me think that 144hz was just a gimmick.  Once I changed that setting, the monitor is everything I hoped it would be",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Over hyped,2014-08-27,Pros:Everything that all the people said before.,Cons:The color were a little bit off. It only took me 10 seconds to fix it so whatever.,Other Thoughts:This is my first time owning a 120+Hz monitor. I was expecting much more than this. People make up such a hype that I coudn't really appreciate the monitor's features.It's a great monitor. Buy it if you would like to try out games with 120+ FPS. Make sure you have a beast though. ( PC ),1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great monitor, with one exception",2014-08-26,"Pros:This monitor is (almost) everything I was looking for.  I was coming from an old 19"" Dell that was really a great monitor, and the thing I liked most about it was its stand.  8"" height adjust, pivot, portrait, and tilt.  I wasn't going to go with a monitor without a stand like that.  Aside from the annoyingly glossy base of this one, it has an even better stand.  The pixel density is great, and the features are awesome.  I have a laptop with HDMI output at the moment, so I can't take advantage of the 144Hz refresh rate yet.  Still, really solid monitor in almost every way...","Cons:The one really lousy thing (which, with a TN panel, is to be expected) is color shift.  I used to use the old Dell (4:3 aspect ratio, btw) in portrait mode because it actually worked better to view websites on.  With this, I really don't even try.  It's a little bit bulky as a 16:9, but the real problem is the vertical (or horizontal in portrait) color shift, it makes being slightly off-angle pretty poorly colored.","Other Thoughts:I've had a slight issue of the power and HDMI cables coming loose, and it seems kinda random.  Not a huge deal, most of the time.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Love It!!!,2014-08-23,Pros:Beautiful 144Hz refresh rate and Lightning fast 1ms response time is the true gaming combination.,"Cons:Still needing to use Display Port for 144Hz capability is minor but irritating if moving around, Colors arent as accurate or appealing as i would like.",Other Thoughts:Illuminating the menu buttons titels on front would be helpful for convenience.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best 144hz monitor for under $300,2014-08-22,"Pros:Got this monitor for my new build, and was expecting to achieve frame rates over 60+ and wanted a monitor that would be capable of that. By far this is the best 144hz monitor for the price. Very responsive, you get a reticle for all you little cheaters out there, and if you have an Nvidia card you get the option to 3D game. Also people are worried about the colors being washed out or dull compared to an ips monitor, but hey, the colors are pretty darn great for being a TN panel. I really recommend this monitor. Once you go 144hz you won't want to go back. Trust me","Cons:Factory preset brightness was a little to well... Bright for liking, but nothing a little adjusting couldn't fix.And the speakers are not the best thing in the world. I would suggest getting speakers or headphones as these are not loud at all.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Love it,2014-08-20,"Pros:I love this monitor. This is actually the second one I've bought. I use it on my gaming computer, and my friends that I just built. It's practically equivalent to upgrading a video card when you go from a 60Hz to this 144Hz monitor.","Cons:If it's really a complaint at all, I'd say that I wish the connection points were on the same side and not so recessed into the monitor, they make it a little tricky to connect.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Running Nvidia Surround with these.,2014-08-20,Pros:Beautiful monitors once you adjust colors for your eyes. Awesome price and low weight makes them ideal for Nvidia surround or Eyefinity.,Cons:Would like to see more display ports. 1 per is lacking. with 1.3 on the way to allow daisy chaining these monitors wont do it.

He was originally using an ASUS VH236H and said that this VG248QE is much smoother. He plays mostly shooters and it actually took him a little while to get used to it. Overall, I would say that this monitor is very good in quality and functionality.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor but req tweaking,2014-08-17,"Pros:This is a great monitor, But tweaking it colors is a must. After I tweak it, I got the color to look much better after I followed some guides on the monitor. Been the best monitor I ever had. I use Trace free 40 as that's the best setting for 144hz.Going from 60hz to 144hz was really noticeable for me.  I do plan to go 3D later on so that's a plus.  DVi-D and DP 1.2 both support 144hz as long your using the right cables.I had a 1440p monitor before this and if i had to do it all over again. I would pick the asus monitor every time.","Cons:Your gonna have to spend some time tweaking the monitor color's as the out of the box settings are bad. There are guides for this monitor that can be used to get it right. Don't expect the speakers to sound good, because they do not. Unless your using them to watch tv.","Other Thoughts:With the amount of other input's i think it should have also had a Picture in picture option too. There are ways to get lightboost to work at 120hz. Also if your gonna use a ICM, your gonna need to use a program that actually keep the iCM loaded so a game doesn't set it back.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor,2014-08-16,Pros:fast smooth action at 144hz in gameplay......Best monitor stand i have ever used.....picture looks good and crisp,Cons:less color depth then some other monitors like an ips panel........still looks good regaurdless,Other Thoughts:Best monitor ive ever used for gaming,0,0

If you Game its worth every penny.,Cons:the bezel is kind of think .. if using more then one.1) its not free2) No G-sync (but that would make it cost 250 more)3) their is not A 27in Verson,"Other Thoughts:I Now own 3x of these attached to my Obutt R3Volution.If you Game this is A must have. 24"" is A bit small ... but these are so cheap you can get 3x and then its not so small.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing monitor at a great price!,2014-08-11,"Pros:This is a great monitor period. I was contemplating getting a 27"" as this is what my family uses for their pc, but I find 24"" is the sweet spot for monitors. The 144Hz definitely makes a difference and I find myself moving windows around just to experience it. The monitor is very bright, but that can be adjusted. I've heard lots of complaints about the colours being horrid, however after calibrating it I've found the colours to be amazing.","Cons:The only con, which isn't worth taking an egg off is that the menu is kind of tricky to get used to. They should have put the two arrow keys beside each other, instead of having the menu button in between them.","Other Thoughts:Overall this is a fantastic monitor with great colour, built in speakers (although I don't use them), the refresh rate is insane and I've never seen anything like it. It's also very cheap for being so amazing. I highly recommend you buy one.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing monitor,2014-08-10,Pros:-Response time-144hz refresh rate-nVidia G-Sync conversion compatible-Affordable price,Cons:Screen is rather bright in the evenings or in a dim room.  Decreasing brightness somewhat deminishes picture quality.,"Other Thoughts:The very first thing i did was order nvidia's G-Sync DIY conversion kit, which is currently only available for this particular monitor.  The end result is simply amazing!  If you play PC games, have a fairly recent to new Geforce card and do not know what G-Sync is, do yourself a favor and take a quick journey over to youtube.Brilliant!!",0,0

That being said ... it looks better than my 5 Y/O 1080p monitor ... but that aint saying much.The speakers are junk too, but who cares ... all LCD monitor speakers are junk even on high end HDTVs.All of this was expected though and is a small price to pay for 144hz.","Other Thoughts:Buy a second monitor that has an IPS panel and use it for art and movies.Be sure to get the right cable and install the drivers for the monitor ... yes ... for the monitor. These are NOT generic pnp monitor drivers. Your computer will have no idea what this monitor is without the drivers.ASUS tech support is laughable.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,120hz + lightboost really makes a difference,2014-08-04,"Pros:I was concerned after ordering this monitor that I wouldn't be able to notice the higher refresh rate and that the image quality would be low (due to other reviews that talked about how much better image quality on IPS monitors is). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the higher refresh rate actually makes a HUGE difference. I find keeping it at 120hz and using Nvidia Lightboost is pretty necessary, however; while 144hz lowers the blurring, Lightboost completely eliminates it.I really want to emphasize the impact using the Lightboost hack has. There is virtually no blurring at all. I find myself looking at the tests on blurbusters just because of how neat it looks to see moving pictures so clearly.I also found the colors, contrast, etc fine, though I only have my previous TN monitor to compare it with. It was much better than that monitor, at least. I should probably mention that I'm color-blind, so it might be more noticeable to someone with normal vision.","Cons:The monitor initially had really strange colors. I noticed other people also mentioned this. It's not a huge deal once you adjust some settings and use the Lightboost hack, however.Other than that, the only ""con"" is that I kind of wish I had splurged the extra $100 for the 27 inch version.",,1,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Very pleased.,2014-07-26,"Pros:-refresh rate (144hz) was a major selling point for me.-some have said default settings are really ""washed out"" but it was really easy to customize using other comments as a guide.-No dead pixels or anything of that sort yet.-many options for video output: Dual link DVI-D, HDMI, displayport",Cons:-Nope,"Other Thoughts:shipping was fast and exactly what I paid for.there are a few comments talking about lightboost or blurbusters.com. honestly i didnt notice any difference (its totally possible that due to my lack of experience with >60hz displays that i overlooked something). the reason i make this comment is if you do the UFO test that they provide it sets the monitors refresh rate to 120hz vice the 144hz you probably had running prior to installing lightboost. so if you use the UFO test while the monitor is set to 120hz without the lightboost program running it looks EXACTLY the same. so i wouldnt bother unless your really looking to  tweak it or dont believe meI was looking for a 4k monitor at first because i was trying to make my first custom pc build top of the line-ish (i7 4930k, 16gb 2400hz ram, and nvidia gtx 780ti). but im glad i went with this 1080p monitor. its good quality and given my build i still get dips down to 30fps in WoW at 1080P(just want to point out i have EVERY option maxed out), so im assuming the performance would be much worse in 4K resolutions.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Bad QA,2014-07-24,Pros:- 144Hz- Price.- LightBoost- Option to add GSYNC.,"Cons:Bad Quality assurance from ASUS with my order. It looks like before the monitor was even packaged the bezel was hit with something very hard, it left a big dent and left white paint. This is my theory anyways...because the box it came in looks fine.While I was still getting all the protective plastic off I heard some loose piece rolling/rattling inside the monitor. I decided to plug it in to test it to see whether it works but the Power button is almost impossible to press. I finally got it to turn on and it seems to work, but I decided to RMA.I wish Newegg didn't ship it in the clearly marked colorful retail box. I understand that it saves on materials and costs but I feel like having it in the retail box is a liability and seems unprofessional from a shipping standpoint.",Other Thoughts:I'll update my rating when I receive my replacement.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazingly smooth,2014-07-22,"Pros:Incredibly fast response time, will notice no lag at all with this monitor. With a few tweaks and color profile loading, the monitor is not nearly as saturated and looks great",Cons:the only con I would add which isnt exactly the monitor which is why I still give it 5 eggs is that anything over 60hz is not supported via HDMI which is crazy to me. HDMI is ultimately DVI with audio yet dual link DVI is the only thing that will transmit the 120 or 144hz? Just bizarre to me...,"Other Thoughts:If you are console gaming and don't know too much or don't really feel like reading into it too much, this monitor is not for you.

It's 144hz refresh rate is amazing.  Zero issues when received or to this day.A note to those that want to use Crossfire:  My dual R9 270X cards in Crossfire will bluescreen when trying to run at 144hz.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2014-07-11,"Pros:You can put the refresh rate up to 144hz. The response time is really fast. This monitor is 3D capable, if you buy the kit for it. Since it doesn't come with the kit, it is less expensive. I haven't had much time with this yet, but I already love this monitor. The image is really crisp and clean. Looks amazing when I play video games. The monitor position can be changed quite easitly.","Cons:None that I can think of at this moment. I know a number of people have needed to calibrate the color of their display. My monitor looks fine just the way it is. Though, I probably do need to dim the brightness a bit.","Other Thoughts:After looking at reviews from different websites and researching what makes this monitor good, I purchased it. I'm very happy with my choice.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Amazing monitor, especially for the price.",2014-07-08,"Pros:- Obviously the main feature of this monitor, the 144Hz refresh rate and 1ms GTG response time. Even when just using the desktop it's pretty noticeable, dragging windows and the mouse around looks super smooth. Nothing looks choppy and headache inducing anymore. Gaming looks even better, everything looks surreal and smooth.- Vibrant and crisp colors (once you configure them), which impressed me considering this is of course a TN panel. (NOTE: don't get this monitor if you're looking for good color accuracy for professional photo editing and other things like that)- The little cable management hook in the back is actually pretty helpful for keeping a clean look.- Easily slides up and down without force, same with tilting and pivoting.- Good build quality with attention to detail.- Responsive buttons which actually click, none of that awful touch sensitive stuff. They're also on the underside of the monitor bezel, so no fingerprint marks and distracting LEDs while gaming or during general use.- Side to side viewing angles are actually quite good for a TN panel, which is useful for Eyefinity or Surround setups.","Cons:- Included power cable and DVI cable are incredibly short. This wasn't necessarily a con for me but it may be for some, so keep that in mind.- As everyone else has said, this isn't a plug and play monitor. You'll need to go to your Nvidia/AMD graphics control panel and set this monitor to 144Hz, it will be 60Hz the first time you plug it in. Also the colors are pretty horrid out of the box, but this is easily fixed with some adjustments (small tutorial in ""Other Thoughts"")- Poor up and down viewing angles, though it is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Try to keep the monitor center to where you are looking at it from. Moving your head around a little won't make much of a difference so you don't have to sit dead still.- Some dithering is rarely noticeable in some situations, but only if I really focus on it. Again, this is a TN panel so no eggs deducted.","Other Thoughts:Overall a fantastic monitor, especially for the price. I downgraded from a 27"" monitor I've had for about a year, and I don't regret it one bit. 24"" is the perfect size and it has definitely helped with my eye strain, not to mention the incredible fluidity. The colors may seem a bit strange at first but they don't look bad in my opinion; you should adjust to them quickly.Color settings:Splendid mode: TheaterBrightness: 90 (adjust this to your liking, I have it very high because theater mode can be dark at times)Contrast: 80Saturation: 50Color temp: User Mode -Red - 96Green - 94Blue - 88Skin tone: ReddishSmart View: OffSharpness: 50Trace Free: 60Then Google ""Reddit glorious VG248QE"" and click the first link. There should be a download link in the post to an ICC profile, download that and save it to your desktop. Next, search for ""Color Management"" which should be found in the control panel and open it. There should be 3 tabs at the top, ""Devices"", ""All Profiles"", and ""Advanced"". Click on ""All Profiles"". Look towards the bottom for an ""Add"" button and click that. Find the ICC profile you downloaded on your desktop, select it, and click add. Next download a program called ""DisplayProfile.exe"". Once you're done downloading that, open it and find the ICC profile titled ""asus_vg248qe_svet"" and click it. You should be done from there.I went with theater mode because it really helps bring out those vibrant and dark colors, but you could also try it with standard mode.",18,2

You must also use either a dual-link DVI cable (included), or a DisplayPort cable to link this monitor and run 144Hz.* People claiming there is no difference between this and a regular monitor likely did not change the refresh rate to 144Hz.

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Terrible Monitor,2014-06-29,Pros:- Possibility of G-Sync modification- Low input lag- Very high response time with LightBoost- Includes speakers,Cons:- Horrific colors even for a TN monitor- Impossible to accurately calibrate grayscale due to dithering- Very low contrast ratio & very high black point level- Speakers pick up coil whine and are of terribly low quality- There are many non-functional settings in this monitor's service menu- Very bad calibration controls for a monitor with such bad colors,"Other Thoughts:- This monitor is PURELY for highly competitive online MultiPlayer video gaming where graphics is completely disregarded. It is not meant for those who like to enjoy eye-candy in video games.- Please don't be fooled by ASUS claims that you can download an ICC profile to achieve a better image quality. You may achieve somewhat better accuracy with a generic ICC profile, but you will need to buy at least i1Display Pro or ColorMunki Display to get a semi-bearable picture. Each monitor unit needs its own calibration. An ICC profile made for another unit may actually worsen your unit's image quality.- No color accuracy improvement will improve the actual perception of colors on this monitor due to incredibly high black point level and incredibly low contrast ratio.- There are better TN monitors out there, so please do not limit yourself to this model. Sure, a TN screen is a TN screen, not meant for photography and has plenty of disadvantages such as gamma shift and uniformity, but there are great TN monitors out there too. This isn't one of them! AVOID at all costs if you like videogame graphics!!!- I ended up hating this monitor and switched to Eizo Foris FG2421, which outperformed this monitor in every single way, except for maybe input lag.",7,8

ASUS,VG278Q,5,To those who say they can't tell the difference between 60Hz and 144HZ..,2014-06-18,"Pros:They're wrong, way wrong. If you swap out your old monitor with this one, it will stay at 60Hz until you change it yourself. And when you do, you WILL notice the difference and that ""wow"" factor will exponentially increase when you load a game on the screen. Even before loading a game, just doing normal things in Windows 8.1 will amaze you in how fluid everything moves.Of course, I must let you know that I'm running a Superclocked GTX 780 with a I5 4670K @ 4.0GHZ with 8GB DDR3 ram so I can easily run all my games far beyond 60FPS. The 144Hz feature was the main reason I bought this monitor, and I don't regret it. Games I ran just in the time that I could test are : Team fortress 2, Titanfall, Far Cry 3, Battlefield 3, and Crysis 2. I've played these games for a long time but I was seeing them in a new, refreshing light when using this monitor.As far as colors go, I knew from other reviewers that the colors out of the box weren't the greatest, but googling ""Asus vg248qe ICC profiles"" fixed that up in a jiffy. Compared to my old monitor (It was a not-so-good Hannspree monitor) , the color is an improvement.I have not noticed any screen tearing on game that run over 144FPS, but I went ahead and forced all games to run Vsync, so no game goes higher than 144FPS. Even with vsync on, I have not noticed the input lag that typically comes with having vsync on which is great.I have not tried the 3D feature of this monitor, but I may very well try it out in the future.","Cons:For Cons, I have not  had this monitor long, but thankfully I haven't noticed any glaring flaws yet. Very simple setup (literally took me less than a minute to put the monitor on its stand and swap out my old monitor).","Other Thoughts:If you cannot run games past 60FPS, don't buy this monitor unless you really need a monitor with low input lag. You won't really be taking advantage of the 144Hz if your computer is struggling to make 60FPS.",8,0

Can't wait to be able to afford new video card and game to really push it.",Cons:None that I can think of.,Other Thoughts:Will be picking up another at some point (when the price drops again) to fully retire my old AOC or maybe I will pick up one of the new 4k's when I can afford it.,0,0

I'll accidently have it set to 60 hz when switching monitor to my other screen sometimes and I can tell instantly that its not 144 hz.

Is there anything else to say?","Cons:As everyone mentions, colors out of the box are too dim and funky, but nothing that can't get fixed with a little tweaking.As everyone also mentions, speakers are pretty much worthless. They'll do the trick if you don't leave Windows, but for movies or gaming, do get a nice set of desktop speakers.Something I haven't seen too many people mention, cables are too short, specially the power cable, had to go out and get a longer one.","Other Thoughts:My TV has a pretty high refresh rate so I kinda knew already what it was to play on a monitor with a refresh rate higher than 60Hz, but then again, on regular TVs you cant actually set the rate to predetermined Hz's, you go with Smooth, Clear, and a bunch of other oddly named modes. And, playing on a TV and sitting 10 ft away sort of makes the effect fade away a bit. But being able to actually set this monitor to 144Hz and sit 16"" away from it, man oh man does it make a difference. The cons are really minor nuisances and are not worth docking stars from the actual performance. Great overall product.",4,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,My Space Monitor of the Future,2014-06-05,"Pros:Make no mistake, this is no mere monitor.This is a 24"" ultra fast no lag space video box of light and sound from the future.If you're going from a 60hz refresh rate to 144hz, it's the same as running on a 5400 rpm HDD and going straight to an SSD with 512mb/s read/write. It's life changing in a tech perspective.I use this mainly for gaming, but with 3d capabilities, I'll be happy to use it for 3d movies in the future utilizing Nvidia's 3D capabilities.The refresh rate makes even the most mundane task of moving your mouse and scrolling seem fluid and amazing.But let's get down to the nitty gritty. You're probably reading the reviews for this because like me, you love to game.It is hands down leagues beyond when you first try out 144hz. I tested it on Borderlands 2, TF2, Civ5, Dishonored, CS:GO, Minecraft, Skyrim, Crysis, you name it. It's unbelievable.To me, it's like experiencing the game in a whole new light and world that I've never seen before.This monitor is fantastic, and I will gladly be picking up two more in the near future.","Cons:The only con I have, as other people have mentioned, is the coloring and backlight bleed is a little high.I adjusted the settings just a little bit to get good coloration, but out of the box, the colors are a bit off.This was the only downside I could see coming from IPS.","Other Thoughts:It's well worth the money, and I'm extremely happy to have purchased it.",6,0

Tons of websites with information about how to adjust out there, just a quick google search away.-Like many have said before me, I should have purchased sooner.","Other Thoughts:I kept putting off buying a new monitor.  My previous was a 24 inch Asus but only ran at 60Mhz.  I, like many others didn't think that it would have made that large of a difference going to 144MHz for 2D gaming.I was wrong, very, very, very, wrong.  I will never go back to 60 MHz monitors ever again.I have two GTX 680s ran in SLI and I ended up always having to do V-sync to keep the screens from tearing from any game I played.  From Starcraft 2, to Counter Strike.I installed this monitor, disabled V-sync, and now even with games running 300 fps on max settings, I don't even see a hint of screen tearing.Zero input lag, max graphics, no v-sync needed and no screen tearing.  If someone would have told me this sooner, I would have purchased this a long time ago.So please, from the words of an enthusiast, if you want the best, take my advise.  This is the best of the best.From FPS, MMORPG, to even games like Diablo 3, the games are twice as better to play and to look at.",6,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,WHooo!,2014-05-26,"Pros:Dang! So crisp, awesome stand!. I really love this monitor. So far so good.","Cons:Nah, Its good.",,4,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing ASUS Displays,2014-05-25,"Pros:I have purchased 3 of these displays for use with my gaming desktop and I can definitely say that it was worth the purchase.  The 1080p resolution looks great through either DP or DVI input, espcially when at 144 Hz refresh rate.","Cons:HDMI input creates a black border around the desktop when displaying from computer sources, creating an ""extra"" bezel of sorts.  When hooking up a current gen or next gen game console the black border disappears.  This could be due to the computer providing additional bezel compensation since HDMI is normally reserved for TV's and not standard computer monitors.",Other Thoughts:I was running these displays in a 3x1 AMD Eyefinity setup but have since changed to 1 primary desktop with 2 extended desktops.  This allows me to run multiple Adobe programs while gaming or watching movies.These displays are definitely worth the money!  If you can get them on sale even better!,0,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Happy with purchase!,2014-05-24,"Pros:For gaming, it has been perfect. I play LoL and FPShooters, it works brilliantly on both pc, 360 and xbone.",Cons:colours are kinda funky without adjustments,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent Monitor !!,2014-05-23,"Pros:This monitor is absolutely beautiful. Now lets cut to the chase.1. I read the reviews after I purchased this monitor about washed out colors - This scared me a little bit.2. I heard this was a TN panel and that it was not as good as a IPS panel.3. After playing around for a month without anything to compare it to I was constantly trying to adjust the colors and I was a little disappointed because I thought I was seeing what everyone in the reviews were talking about..My conclusion : This monitor is beautiful and excellent for gaming. I am now comparing side by side with my old monitor and the color is far more vibrant and clear with this new Asus monitor.I no longer see what I thought I was seeing with this ""washed out look"" everyone was talking about. Comparing  my old monitor to this one, the picture is so clear it makes my old monitor look like garbage.Dropping the blue down to 77 on this asus monitor matches my old monitor and the color is still better.Right out of the box the monitor is blue. VERY VERY BLUE I dropped the color settings down toRed : 96green :94Blue : 88This is what I saw on forums but honestly each monitor needs to be adjusted differently. Dropping down the brightness to 50 is a good start but with my colors now correctly adjusted I can use the 100 brightness setting and its absolutely gorgeous. The brightness at night may hurt your eyes a little bit so 50 is really nice. I am using all default settings on the monitor ( splendid mode =standard ) except for the red/green/blue.I love this monitor I think anyone who buys it will be happy. I dont need a bigger screen, i went from my old 22"" to this beautiful 24"". NO complaints.","Cons:Minor color adjustments needed. Not really a con.In fact my father bought a 55"" back-lit LED Samsung and after XX  mount of hours someone had to come out and calibrate the tv. I believe this is something all LED monitors/tvs need to go through. Once your settings are set, gorgeous picture. Which in my case was about 1 month. :-)","Other Thoughts:Everyone enjoys something different. To my experience, make your own judgements before seeing what everyone else says about the washed out color thing. You may start to believe what others are seeing.The colors really are messed up out of the box though. Not sure about dropping the red/green down but the blue definitely. Dropping the blue will give far better color in my opinion. You will notice it right off the bat. Something just wont look right.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Wonderful monitor,2014-05-23,"Pros:The fluidity is crazy. If you are a gamer, this is hard to beat. Very hard. If you have a system that can drive high framerates at 1080p, you're going to have a great time with this screen. Now, on to the details. The build quality of the monitor is excellent. The stand is fully featured, with full height and tilt adjustment. It doesn't feel cheap either. There's even cable management clips. Mine arrived with zero stuck pixels, and still has none more than a year later. LED backlight is brighter than the sun. I run at 22/100 brightness. That's supposed to be ~150cd/m2. At 100 brightness it puts out nearly 500. That's crazy. Make sure you don't turn this on for the first time in the dark. The included features are also very cool. The on screen crosshair is pretty cool for games that don't have one natively, like Killing Floor. Almost feels like cheating. The timer is also useful if you're like me and forget you put laundry/food in its respective place once you get into a game. Lightboost is also AMAZING. The clarity is jaw dropping. The motion blur is literally non existent. (For those unaware, lightboost is essentially 3d mode being used to strobe the screen each refresh, it's not supported officially by nvidia or Asus, but it's easy to find out about on Google so I consider it an additional feature).","Cons:Colors are bad. Whether this matters to you or not, it's a fact. I personally couldn't care less about the saturation and gamma curves, I just want butter smooth image. Just be aware that this is far away from an IPS based screen. It can be adjusted to be decent, but that's all you're going to get. It's the main tradeoff to get this kind of refresh speed. The other complaint is that the uniformity of the pixels isn't that great. Many of these units have a spot in the upper left (and all the edges for that matter) that are darker than the center of the screen. It becomes invisible after using for a while, but it's always there.","Other Thoughts:Vroom vroom, fast.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor!,2014-05-23,Pros:Great Gaming monitor. Refresh rate makes games look really smooth. Also has the option to install G-sync for even smoother gaming.,Cons:Colors out of the box is not the best but once adjusted its good to go.,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Nice Display,2014-05-22,"Pros:144Hz 1msnice display, i realy like it, the colors are beautiful, the images are clear.supports 3D vision, something that i will use for sure.",Cons:i have it since maybe 5 months and none so far.,"Other Thoughts:Really fast shipping that doesn't cost so much, 2 days and it was home.i bought the 3D vision 2 kit and the day i received them when i wanted to try them my graphics card died and the only GPU that i had was a AMD GPU so no 3D for now.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,OH MY,2014-05-22,Pros:for any one who says that the eye cannot see 144 hz so you are wasting your money is a dingdong.  144 hz is a noticeable difference from 60 hz. everything is crisp and amazing. it is great overallthe adjustments are good . i like them,"Cons:color, but it is a TN panel so you know what you are getting but with adjustments it great. i think it is worth it for the 144hz.you will never go back to 60 hz so from now on your monitors will be expensive",,3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,144hz gaming WILL make a difference,2014-05-21,"Pros:144hz and 1ms responseDP, HDMI, DVI-DHeight adjustable standSuper bright backlight (blinding)",Cons:Washed out colorsPanel uniformity issues,"Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor to see what all the craze was about 120Hz+ gaming.  I knew going in that this monitor was going to have washed out colors like many review sites stated.  But I did not think it was going to be this bad when using 144Hz setting.Also the panel uniformity is poor.  On mine the upper left corner is always a little bit dimmer then the rest of the display.But after calibrating it with CalMan RGB it corrects some of the color and greyscale; nothing to write home about.You will not be disappointed in the 144Hz.  Just moving the mouse on your desktop is a new experience.  Playing BF4, TitanFall, Dota2, TF2 and even HearthStone (yes a card game) is so much better.  Everything is just smoother.  There is still screen tearing but its reduced.I hope NVidia bring back some G-Sync DYI kits.  I really want to see what this monitor is like with G-Sync",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great value,2014-05-21,"Pros:For gaming, this is perfect for anyone using it on a desk setup. The size is pretty much perfect as well. The matte finish doesn't reflect the light which helps in a lighted room. The fit and finish is well done, you can swivel the base, and rotate for vertical SHMUPS as well.Finally the price is perfect - you really can't find a better value. And if you want 3d, you have 3d capability as well.","Cons:-The menu is not the easiest to navigate, also the text needs a lot of adjusting due to the high brightness.","Other Thoughts:If you game, this really is the standard in my opinion.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,AWESOME!!!!,2014-05-21,"Pros:- Great color- Bright- High refresh rate- Amazing customization on angle, height, and landscape vs portrait- over all",Cons:- too wide for my desk :),,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,The right monitor for a gamer,2014-05-21,Pros:The 144hz upgrade from a 60hz monitor will stun you. I play competitive FPS games (TF2 CS:S CS:GO) as well as single player RPG's like Skyrim and other games like Dota 2.This monitor makes your experience fluid and smooth and even contributes to the game immersion. It's a must for anyone who games heavily and wants more out of their experience.The price is also great for what you get.,"Cons:Coming from an IPS panel monitor, the colors might underwhelm you but it wasn't enough to knock off an egg.See other thoughts.","Other Thoughts:I spent the 280 dollars on this monitor upgrade instead of buying a GPU upgrade (HD6770). I usually don't run my settings very high regardless. Take this into consideration before you manage your budget.Coming from and IPS monitor the colors weren't up to par from what I am used to. I use my IPS (Dell Ultra sharp) for everything else but gaming. I run a dual monitor setup so it really isn't a con for me personally. If you don't run a dual monitor setup, consider what other uses you have for your computer.Oh yeah, noob mistake I ran into. BE SURE TO USE A DUAL LINK DVI CABLE.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,,2014-05-20,Pros:The monitor is amazing. I was in the market for a new monitor that did 3D and was also great for gaming. I bought an Asus last year around the first of the year and wish I waited until this came out. Couldn't be happier.,Cons:Non really other than you need to do some calibration right out of the box.,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,1ms Response = Amazing,2014-05-17,"Pros:Seriously, the 1ms response time is very noticeable. It's hard to play games on normal LCDs now. Great for action games, fighting games, and especially rhythm games. I have my new gaming rig and my PS3 hooked up to it and love playing games with this monitor.Colors are good. Great size; not too big not too small.Very Adjustable. Up, down, the base can spin, the screen angle can be moved up/down, and the monitor can be tilted to a vertical position. There is a 27"" version of this monitor but I passed on it because it was not adjustable.144hz is AMAZING. I have never seen games so smooth and yet so responsive.Has some cool gaming features like a cross hair display and timer but I haven't really used them at all.","Cons:Colors are good and brightness is good but not quite up to par with say, a newer Samsung TV.Built in sound is not great. Had to go out and get speakers.The monitor can only pivot to vertical by going clockwise. Won't tilt counter-clockwise. Not really a con but i mention it just for planning out the setup.","Other Thoughts:This is not really the best home entertainment monitor but It is however, the one of the best gaming monitors out there. Some people might argue that it doesn't make a difference, but I say that the 1ms response time is crucial to gaming, and 144Hz is great. Can't wait to get another one and have a dual monitor setup.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Very Happy,2014-05-16,"Pros:Hooked it up, Calibrated the colors, and my games look amazing. Everything is so clear and crisp. It definitely gives you an advantage in FPS games. You get a faster reaction times and I can see people moving around a lot further away when I haven't seen them before with a 60hz monitor.The stand with height adjustment, swivel, tilt, and everything you need is great. I keep my monitor at eye level",Cons:NONE!! but see other thoughts,"Other Thoughts:Out of the box this Monitor's Colors look horrible. They're easy to calibrate though and now this TN Panel looks just as good as my IPS it replaced. The 144Hz refresh rate is SOOO Much better than playing on 60Hz. After my eyes adjusted to the new refresh rate, using a 60Hz monitor(work computer) makes my head hurt. I can see how the mouse cursor jumps rather than runs smooth.I LOVE this monitor, I can play without V-Sync and its silky smooth",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor for Gaming! Maybe Best!,2014-05-16,"Pros:Great for gaming! Refresh rate so high my eyes aren't tired after or dry after hours of use. I can definitely see things clearer in FPS games like BF4 and Titanfall. Its very refreshing and things move smoother, like I got a new set of eyes! Great gaming monitor.",Cons:No USB hub built-in but that's fine.,Other Thoughts:I first purchased this upgrading from the LG 29inch monitor. IPS is great for photoshop and stuff like that but nor for gaming. I all had an ASUS 23inch 120Hz gaming motor I used daily at work just for the refresh rate and I have to say this monitor is better. I know it's only 24Hz more but the color reproduction on this model compared to the older 23inch one is much better. But TN Panels being the way the are they aren't going to reproduce the exact colors.,0,0

Great price!",Cons:Not seeing a real difference between 60hz and 144hz.  Default settings need some major adjusting.,"Other Thoughts:Upgraded from a 27"" 60hz monitor to this smaller 144hz and I'm having buyer's regret.  Using a Radeon 270 with beta drivers, displayport, monitor is set to 144 in Windows and I just don't see a difference.  (Tried the Dual DVI cable that came with it as well)Experimented with Lightboost hack others have mentioned but it still seems like mouse movements and such could be smoother.",1,6

Love the 144hz.This monitor is a must have for gamers!,Cons:The color out of the box may be a bit wierd but for me I never bothered to change it as I see no problem with it.the plastic does scratch easily but its no big deal as long as their is no scratches on the screen,Other Thoughts:A must buy!,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor.,2014-05-10,"Pros:Everything on this monitor looks great, it's LED backlit with a ridiculous contrast ratio. The refresh rate and response time are insane on this thing. Everything feels liquid smooth on this thing. The stand is weird how it works, but it's really easy to move and it's very sturdy.","Cons:The only thing that's a little annoying about this thing is the power cord is a little short, probably like 4 feet or so. But obviously you can change it out for a longer one if you need to as it uses the standard power connector.",,1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Excellent monitor, Ecstatic with my purchase",2014-05-06,"Pros:This is an all around great monitor, but especially good for gaming. I was a little skeptical about the difference between this monitor and a comparable 120hz, but I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase. The monitor size is great, I love the stand as it is easily movable exactly as you need it. The screen itself is amazing, resolution is great, and the speed, ohhhh the speed. I did a lot of research before finally picking this monitor out, but let me save you the trouble, if you want the absolutely best gaming monitor, this is one of your best bets, if not THE best.","Cons:Only con is that the colors take a little calibration, but afterwards the colors are still great, even for a TN panel.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,works great,2014-05-06,"Pros:works perfect, i havent tried the 3D yet so i cant confirm this part yet, i havent also tried multi monitor configuration yet, so i dont know if theres an issue there. but i had a samsung monitor from 2008, this upgrade was noticiable!",Cons:depending on height angle there seems to have different colors or brightness... like i experience on laptop screens. i didnt have this issues on my samsung from 2008,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome Monitor for 3D!,2014-05-06,Pros:Amazing 3D gaming! Works great with nvidia surround setups as well. Great monitor for the price. Love the red accents all over the monitor.,Cons:None,,1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great Monitor, fasssst",2014-05-04,"Pros:First of all it's 144hz with 1ms response time and produces very good colors even though it's a tn panel. One of my favorite features probably has to be the stand with height, tilt, swivel, and pivot adjustments you can really dial in your viewing angle which is what you need for this panel. Also the 3d ready feature is cool to have, even though I haven't used it yet","Cons:The bezel and the base are glossy surfaces, which I personally don't like for ascetic purposes but obviously doesn't effect the performance.","Other Thoughts:If you want a fast 1080p monitor for gaming of all types with no screen blur or ghosting this is the one, however if you want a better experience for movies or just really like hd and deep color I would recommend a 2560x1440 ips monitor if you don't mind the speed sacrifice",4,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor!,2014-05-04,Pros:This monitor is amazing. 144hz blows 60 HZ out of the water anyday. Games and movies have never been smoother.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,i love this monitor!!,2014-05-01,Pros:-the stand that comes with the monitor is great quality.  pretty sturdy.-144 hz <3 <3 <3-i like that the buttons on the monitor are actually buttons and not touch like some of the other monitors,Cons:-took me a bit to find the right settings for when i am using this to browse the internet or playing games.  more of a nitpicky thing really-speakers are not that great.  but thats not what this monitor is about (plus im pretty sure 99% of people who buy this have their own speakers/headphones to plug into anyway)  again just a nitpick-price tag i suppose?  would have been nice if it was a little cheaper.  but im not gonna complain :),Other Thoughts:excellent monitor.  would recommend to anyone!!,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Trust the Reviews,2014-05-01,"Pros:Just like everyone else has said the 144hz is the first and foremost benefit of these monitors. You'll notice the benefit immediately just by moving windows around your desktop. Turn on a graphically intense game like Battlefield 4 and you'll see where this monitor has made a name for itself. I'm running GTX 680's in SLI, I haven't see the screen tear or ghost once and the graphics are on ultra for everything.I haven't used the 3D functionality as of yet, but that's just because I've had a renewed interest in all of the games that I played through on my old monitor so I haven't had time to go through the process of ordering/installing them.There's no way that you will not be happy with your purchase with these things. I have 2 now and am seriously considering purchasing a 3rd for the ability to play games with the higher resolutions.The stand for this monitor is excellent as well. The multiple angles of articulation make it very easy to get the monitor the the perfect position. The stand is very sturdy and if you purchase multiple monitors they are very easy to align.",Cons:I have seen it mentioned a couple of times and I have to agree that in default settings this monitor seems to have a much higher brightness than other monitors in its class. I had to tinker around with the settings a little in order to bring out the vibrance. Definitely not such a hassel that would justify losing an egg.,"Other Thoughts:Overall, this is the perfect monitor for gaming in the 24"" space. Asus did just release a larger version of this monitor and honestly that would be the only other monitor I would consider in this monitors stead. I've had nothing but great experiences with Asus products in the past and the quality for this monitor leaves me with little concern that will change.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2014-04-29,"Pros:VERY fast, great resolution, 3d ready is nice feature for the future. Colors seem vivid to me (I'm not a color snob...speed is my game).

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Monitor I Ever Had,2014-04-29,"Pros:144 hz monitor with quick response times, great for games that go past 60 fps.Lightboost Hack or G-Sync capable.Has 3D capability, if you’re into that sort of thing. (You need to buy shutter glasses)Comes with a 5-foot dual-link DVI cable, so you don’t have to worry about having the right cord for full effect of 144 hz.Great adjustable stand and you can turn the monitor 90 degrees for a portrait orientation.Comes with built in speakers, but I highly doubt a PC gamer is going to use them.",Cons:Monitor needs some calibrating/tweaking to get the colors looking just right.,"Other Thoughts:If your video card can support going past 60 fps on many games, then I would pick this up and install the Lightboost hack. I tried this monitor out on Dishonored, Skyrim, Battlefield 4, Diablo 3 and I threw in Super Meat Boy just to see how this monitor would look with 2D gameplay. Everyone of these games looked so much more fluid compared to a 60hz monitor, except for Diablo 3. For some reason, D3 does not have a noticeable difference between 60 fps and 120 fps compared to the other games. The weird thing is it almost looks slightly better with it being locked in at 60 fps with the use of vertical sync.Also, if the colors of this monitor bother you, look up “Reddit Glorious VG248QE” and click on the first result. The top post should really help you out on getting this thing look amazing.",4,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,OUTSTANDING!,2014-04-28,Pros:Reported specs fit the hype.  Gaming 2D is near unacceptable with this monitor coupled with the NVidia 3D Vision 2 glasses.,Cons:None other than game programmer SNAFU's.,,0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome Monitor,2014-04-25,"Pros:144hz, very fast refresh rate, colors extremely vibrant. This is the monitor if you want to dominate the opposition.

ASUS,VG278Q,3,Dead Pixel,2014-04-24,Pros:*Great Color*Good size*Great for gaming,Cons:*Dead pixel at 9 months - see below,"Other Thoughts:This monitor has been great for 9 months. I would definitely recommend it to others and probably still will if my issue is taken care of properly. After 9 months of heavy usage, the monitor has a dead pixel right in the middle of the screen, it is not noticeable unless something dark is behind it, so it may have already been there before I noticed it.If this problem is taken care of by Asus or newegg in good fashion, I will probably change the rating and will update the review. Other than this issue, I would rate the monitor 5 stars. I just hope that if it is replaced, it will not be with a refurbished one and it will not happen again !",0,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Gotta have for gaming!,2014-04-24,Pros:All I have to say is if you have doubt of the ability and difference this monitor is capable of find one in a local store and compare then hurry back to newegg for the best possible deal! best purchase I have made in forever! ummm hu,Cons:They should send a starter bottle of cleaner with it and a cool asus monogramed microfiber cleaning cloth!

THIS is a gaming monitor!That being said, this IS a gaming monitor. (see cons)  You can get this display looking great, but don't professionally edit photos on it.  Search for ""Lagom LCD Test Patterns"" for easier calibration.Lightboost is easy to enable, but the purple tint is too much for me to want to use it outside of a tournament or LAN.  It still looks fluid without Lightboost though.  In my opinion, this monitor is worth the money.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Monitor Ive Ever Owned,2014-04-23,"Pros:Pros include, swivel adjustment, height adjustment, multiple inputs, very bright screen. Coming from a 22"" non led 120hz viewsonic there is a night and day difference.  Next to no light bleed around the edges, the viewsonic suffered a lot from this. Whites are brighter and blacks are darker compared to the 22"".  Mine arrived with zero dead pixels thank the lord. I enabled the lighboost hack which makes on screen movement crystal clear (zero motion blur). I tested it using the ufo test so im 100% sure its working.","Cons:Had to upgrade vid card to 780 gtx to get BF4 to run on high at 1920 X 1080.  My 570 could do 120-130 fps on low. Comes with the territory i guess so not enough to take off an egg.  I guess another very insignificant con is that the lightboost hack only works at 120hz and not 144hz, again not enough to take an egg off.",Other Thoughts:The brightness and contrast didnt look good coming straight out of the box.  I think it was moreso the brightness.  I turned it down in nvidia control panel and increased the digital vibrance 10 pts so its at 60%.  Definitely played around with brightness and contrast in the asus OSD menu as well.  Finally got it the way i want it and viola! Now my computer monitor is as bright and as vibrant as my led tv!,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2014-04-19,Pros:144Hz looks magical.  3D Vision (1 and 2) gaming works great as well.  No pixels DOA.,Cons:A little pricey?  Haven't tried the built-in speakers but I suspect they're nothing special.,,0,0

It had the highest reviews and all I can say is I wouldn't buy it again.  Something here stinks.  Even the sky in my video games is the wrong color.  Like someone mixed grains of different colored sand together and hoped for the best.  I am running a good GFX card.  I think I might switch back to my old monitor.  The CD they give you is only for an LCD monitor, this is supposed to be LED / & LCD with back lighting.  The company can contact me if they want, but I doubt they will.  I would still buy a laptop from them in a heartbeat though.",,1,6
ASUS,VG278Q,5,G-SYNC + VG248QE  = Gaming Bliss,2014-04-18,Pros:Below are the Pros of this monitor with G-Sync kit installedNo Input lag keyboard(Corsair K95) Mouse (Razer Mamba Elite 2012 wireless)BF4 setting on ULTRANo Screen TearingNo LagSuper Smooth game playVery easy to stay on targets with any gunHigh frame game play @ 144Hz or lower in BF4Even if frames start to go really low in the 50-60's no problems just super smooth all the time.The G-Sync kit only took 30-minutes or less to install and was very easy.,Cons:G-Sync sometimes does not like SLI with some games (driver updates will fix this problem)If your frames go above 144Hz games start to stutter (have to set a registry hack to not make frames NOT to go above 144/Hz),"Other Thoughts:Running the following below with some games not liking SLI with G-SYNC then I disable it and only use one card. In BF4 I run SLI and have to set the registry for the game not to go over 144 frames (144Hz) because it will make G-SYNC start to stutter so I set it to 140 frames (max) and my G-SYNC to 144Hz 1920x1080 with no problems now. Just super super smooth game play I really think this is a HUGE improvement over V-SYNC total game changer and it really works. Before buying this monitor a month ago I was using the ASUS VG278HE  27"" 2ms with TOASTY's strobelight hack and it was very nice then but not as good as the G-SYNC setup.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Just Do It,2014-04-14,"Pros:Stop thinking. Just do it. I bought this monitor with 0 regrets whatsoever. On sale, full price.... just buy it.- 144Hz refresh rate is unreal. Whoever says 60Hz to 144Hz makes little to no difference must think no different of a Fiat to a Ferrari. It's ABSOLUTELY noticeable. And amazing.-Colours. I'm sure there's better - but that's the case for almost anything. At 300 bucks, these colours kick some serious rear. Just adjust them properly in the monitor settings (to whatever you like!). You can also try your hand at ICC profiles (very easy to use) if you think other peoples opinions will line up exactly with yours.- Cable management in the back is a plus. Nothing fancy, but just what you need.- Stand spins on the base. When you normally rotate a monitor, you have to hold the base and rotate the screen. Not with this monitor! The base has a ""base"" underneath it, so the whole monitor rotates with minimal force (and one hand).- Solid tilt/height lock-One more for the 144Hz... like SERIOUSLY. Just buy the monitor already. Why are you still reading this? Go click ""Add to Cart"".","Cons:-To me, this monitor blissfully perfect. I noticed with crumby pictures you will notice the ""sharpness"" setting as you change it in the monitors settings. This is particularly noticeable with Windows 8.1 default background (the orange-yellow boxes). Don't worry - Put in an actual HD picture and adjust the monitor.-Nothing else here (have you clicked Add to Cart yet?)","Other Thoughts:So you can go ahead and add this to your cart now... The refresh rate is noticeable everywhere. Windows animations, fast typing feels like butter (especially in Office 2013 with those improved animations), Gaming is a whole new world.I see people saying get a DisplayPort cable... I just used the DVI it came with and it seems to be working, but I may give that a go someday.",1,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor for the Price!,2014-04-13,"Pros:Has great brightness and Contrast second only to Samsung which you will pay more for.The varied different modes help with finding the best fit for your set up, or use.The Gaming Reticle function is great for shooter's or anything First Person.Colors are over-Saturated in various viewing modes, but once you calibrate to specified specs of your liking as everyone's eye's are different. The quality is astonishing.Refresh rate is for Gamer's, worth it if your about frames.Great price for the features given, anything with these on a  Samsung, Dell Ultra will be almost $100-200 more.","Cons:As a color snob, I will admit Samsung and Higher end Dell monitor's produce better, more truer colors.Brightness is too  much sometimes even at lower settings.Still a little edge bleed, which may be case by case basis. Not noticeable while gaming, but when watching something in widescreen you do see it.","Other Thoughts:For the Money, I was going for 27"" but after putting this in and raising the height, It's more than enough for viewing,designing and mainly Playing games at high refresh rate.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,Coil Whine After 1 Month,2014-04-13,"Pros:The monitor will definitely run at 144 Hz, making use of your GPUs full ability.","Cons:After about 3 weeks, I noticed a strange noise that would happen as soon as I started up Diablo 3. I tested with BF4, starcraft 2, Crysis, and the Batman Arkham series and found the same result. Any time the monitor is in gaming use, loud coil whine occurs. I tested at different refresh rates and found that if I lower the refresh rate all the way to 60 Hz, the whine is bearable, still present, but not loud enough to hear through my headset.Summary, save your money and buy either another 144 Hz monitor or get a cheaper 60 Hz monitor with better picture quality. The coil whine issue makes you feel embarrassed to show your friends your rig and will make you regret your decision.",,2,8
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Monitor,2014-04-12,Pros:This monitor WILL look smoother than a 60 Hz LCD ESPECIALLY w/ STROBING (basically a CRT simulator).Tons of swivel-ability. Sturdy base.Can use 3D (not at same time as strobing),"Cons:People have ridiculed me for dropping money on these because ""the eye can't see more than 20 or something fps DUH.""","Other Thoughts:Check for strobing programs online if you're interested in what is essentially zero motion blur. Every other frame will be a black screen which will make the screen a bit darker and cut your frames in half. However, motion blur will be non-existent.If you don't understand what motion blur is, play an rts, scroll past some stuff with the keyboard. Notice how impossible it is to make out fine details when screen is moving.I find the improvement from 144 to STROBED 120 is far more noticeable than the improvement from 60 to 144.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,"Great monitor, glaring oversights",2014-04-12,"Pros:The response time and refresh rate is AWESOME. I don't think I can go back from 144hz gaming. When a game will hit 100+ frames, it looks amazing and feels great, especially in shooters and the like.Image quality is decent, contrast is pretty good, and the colors are vibrant.","Cons:Adjustment settings are a bit lacking and it's pretty hard to calibrate to accurate colors. Image quality isn't amazing, although it does the trick for the most part.The biggest issue I have with the monitor is how the input selection works. It's atrocious. It automatically detects if there is an input but it gives almost no time for the device to hit that window. With something like an Xbox 360, which has admittedly an unusual boot process, it makes things very difficult when trying to switch from another input such as DisplayPort. It's infuriating having to start the system 10 times tryingt o start it up and then switch the inputs just right, not too fast and not too slow, to catch the 360 as it boots up. This would have been a moot point if the detection on the input switching was more lenient, giving more time for devices to catch the monitor before switching away. Granted, most of the things that would cause issues here would be home theatre devices, but at the same time, what the hell else am I going to have in alternate inputs on a monitor?An option for manual, forced input selection or an extended time to before automatically switching would be far better.","Other Thoughts:Awesome monitor, but not very good at much of anything else.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent Value,2014-04-11,"Pros:Price144hzStand is awesomeThis monitor is the best for enthusiast gamers that want 144hz without spending too much. There are other options that have better looking colors, but you have to pay $100+ more. This price can't be beat.I also want to point out again, that the stand is awesome. Very high quality, plus VESA mounted so can be reused if you decide to mount this screen another way.Gaming experience is substantially improved. Heck, even the desktop experience is improved - the mouse cursor is so smooth.","Cons:Ruined my opinion of 60hz monitors. Once you go 144hz, you never go back.","Other Thoughts:Colors aren't the best out there, but this monitor was not designed to look the best. It was designed for performance, and it accomplished that goal. Note that the out of box colors will need to be adjusted if you want them to be more accurate. This is not a con in my eyes, because you should calibrate any monitor you get, even if the out of box settings look ""good"".",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great value,2014-04-10,"Pros:* Stand is vesa-mounted, so when you remove the stand to mount to a monitor mounting mechanism, you have a universally compatible stand good for most monitors* Stand is *very* nice, includes cable management and has a built-in swivel mechanism, as well as a height adjustment. Also allows for rotating the monitor.* Inputs galore - connect via HDMI (no 3D with this option, though), DVI, or display port. I use both the DVI and Display Port with the two I bought.","Cons:* Monitor rotation doesn't appear to be lockable. Not very noticeable if this is your only monitor, but putting two of them next to each other is nearly impossible to align perfectly.* Includes speakers. I'd rather not pay for them, and I certainly won't be using them. I don't know of anybody who would and would be willing to pay this much for a monitor.* Includes HDMI, but has no 3D support for it. From researching, it appears that even though 3D should be possible over HDMI at 720p resolutions, the firmware of this screen does not support it. So... if you use HDMI, expect to be locked in at a 60 Hz refresh rate. Alternatively, get yourself an adapter and use either display port or DVI-DL (assuming your source doesn't have similar firmware limitations).",,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Smooth image quality,2014-04-09,"Pros:Right off the bat 144hz is awesome. Metro Last Light and Tomb Raider look photo realistic on this monitor vs a certain 700$ 27 inch samsung. I had to pick this up after breaking the samsung, and downgraded in size. Took me a bit to get used to 24 inches vs 27 but the response rate is so worth it. I don't see how anyone can game today with a 60hz monitor, truly missing out.The color quality is good, but I suspect a IPS would yeild better results. Can not find a IPS 3d monitor for 3D Vision 2 and that is mainly why I bought this monitor (though I can't afford the glasses kit yet). Most off theres no glare like my samsung, and I really appreciate that.I'd recommend this to anyone on a budget. I specifically got this over the 27 inch VE/H due to this being cheaper and 1ms. I plan on getting a 780GTX in the near future to use the 144hz maximum capability.","Cons:Older cards such as the HD 5770 and around that generation can not use the 144hz. At least my HD 5770 can not, causing screen tearing. I tested a r9 270x 4gb and that had no problem. I think they should write a warning about that, so people with older parts are aware they need to upgrade for 144hz. 120hz runs fine though.Also the only thing that really upset me off was the power cable. This is the 21st century why am I getting such a short power cable?! I'm wondering if a gold plated dual link DVI would be better than the default I received for this monitor.","Other Thoughts:I like this monitor a lot but when I have the in come and a new 3D vision monitor comes out that has a IPS, I'm going that way. I love lucid colors but the samsung wasn't even an IPS...",1,0

Can't put my finger on it, but I don't like using them in portrait.","Other Thoughts:I still love this monitor, even with its shortcomings.I've started turning down some settings in games so that I'm able to push 144fps.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Brings you gaming to the next Lvl!!!,2014-04-06,"Pros:I was playing on a 120hz monitor... stepped up to two of these... everything is amazing... refresh... colors... contrast... I could go on but no need buy these you won't regret it.Adjustable height, tilt, rotate is also amazing!!!",Cons:Short Power cords (had to buy longer). And also most video cards only have one DVI-D so you can't use included cords if you want to push more than one of these to 144hz. Display Port is the only way to go for multiple monitors (I'm sure some people have run into this). And don't use hdmi won't get you to 144hz either!,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,"Good, not great.",2014-04-05,Pros:144hz refresh rate + 1m response time! Fast animation is so much smoother & more fluid on here than on my old 60Hz + 5ms response time monitor (a Samsung 204b). I've been accused of cheating on UT3 just because this monitor makes the sniper rifle a whole lot easier to use (is that a pro or a con?).,"Cons:I bought this monitor because it came highly recommended on Tom's Hardware. However, I never could get the colors calibrated exactly right. Using the ""Lagom LCD Test"" for contrast, either the colors look too washed out or there's significant crushing. Eventually, I gave up on that and just played with my monitor settings in Skyrim and New Vegas until it looked good enough. Even now, I feel like I have to compromise between having either washed out greens / blues, or over saturated reds.","Other Thoughts:Here are the settings I wound up using.For games, I have it on ""Scenery"" mode (""Game"" mode makes darks too light & washed out), with Brightness = 50, Contrast = 50, Saturation = 70.When watching videos, I have it on ""Theater"" mode, with Brightness = 30, Contrast = 30, Saturation = 50.When reading text, I have it on ""Standard"" mode with brightness = 30, contrast = 0, saturation = 50. This monitor is super-bright - it's like looking at the sun unless you set brightness / contrast really low (which probably contributes to my washed out colors, but oh well).Overall, I'm content with my choice. Since this is for my gaming PC, with the above settings colors are acceptable, and I really really love the fast refresh rate. However, if I were you I'd seriously think about splurging an extra $200 for the BenQ monitor instead.",0,0

By now I had it for several months and I'm simply loving it, its everything I expected from a monitor of this sort. For general windows usage the 144hz refresh + 1ms response time definitely improve the experience and as for gaming my kdr went from around 2(I was using a 32"" hdtv 60hz + 8ms resp. previously) in most games to at least 3 or more, its not uncommon for me to go 5:1 in bf4 with this monitor.  I don't have a sound system so I can really appreciate the built in audio for youtube and even netflix videos, perhaps it could've been better if the speakers were somewhere on the front, however even as it is its fit for purpose in my opinion.","Cons:It was a pain in the A to get the brightness and contrast right ratio right, but once you dial it in its really hard to complain about the quality. Now the main con I have with this monitor is the vertical viewing angle. I have a slightly more elevated desk so the monitor sits a little higher than it usually would which causes the top 10-15% of it goes ""negative color"" on dark pictures if my head is too low, this probably wont affect most people.Another thing that bugs me is how on the lower right side you can see the backlight moreso than in other areas, probably unique to mine though, just a minor nitpick.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Gaming Monitor,2014-03-23,"Pros:As a heavy gamer, I love this monitor. 144Hz is amazing. The difference is very clear over a 60Hz 1ms monitor.Make sure you tell your graphics card in the software (Nvidia Control Panel), (Intel Graphics Control), or (Catalyst Control Center) to use this monitor at 144Hz otherwise I won't make a difference.You can SLI or Non-SLI at 144Hz even if another connected monitor is operating at 60Hz.Graphics cards must be on 3D clocks settings to accept the 144Hz output mode. Keep this in mind if you crash every time you try to set it to 144Hz when you first get this monitor.If you run 2D, you can choose between running at 144Hz. Or 120Hz with Lightboost enabled.

I own a Dell U2711 IPS WQHD monitor.  It does over 1 billion colors and the color really pop out of the screen.  But it only does 60 Hz and has some input lag.   IPS monitors are great for photoshop, autocad, and movies...not for fast paced gaming.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing!,2014-03-17,Pros:Right out of the box it was great. I adjusted it to operate at  144hz and WOW does it pop. Ive tried the various setup for bright and contrast to see which I like. I unlocked the LightBoost too. Alot of great options in adjustability too.  I had a trip monitor system before with some 21s. My goal is to eventually add 2 more of these after I upgrade my GPUs.,"Cons:None yet, not even the price. Totally worth it..",,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,144hz,2014-03-15,Pros:For those who say there is no difference between 60hz and 120/144hz you need to realize that there is. WOW. Comparing it to all the previous monitors I've worked with it is like night and day. Games run like butter. The stand is also a huge plus as it moves in almost in direction.,"Cons:Light is not even on the panel. For example, the top left corner is darker than the rest. Make sure you download an ICC profile for the color management as the stock colors SUCK. Don't use the speakers please.","Other Thoughts:Every time I use any other monitor I always move my mouse around and see if it is higher than 60hz. Again, make sure you use an ICC profile.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,1,Poor Quality. Do not buy,2014-03-14,Pros:Looked great when it was working,"Cons:I bought this monitor based on the glowing reviews here. It worked fine for 3 years and just about when the warranty expired the monitor went bad with the ""2 seconds to black"" issue. Asus wants to charge me $155 to repair it as well as pay for shipping both ways.","Other Thoughts:The quality of ASUS products appears to be inferior.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Gaming Monitor,2014-03-13,"Pros:Love this monitor. Low response time, high refresh rate, and great color representation once you adjust the settings yourself. Not to mention support for the GSYNC DIY Kit, this monitor is everything a hardcore gamer could want.+ 144Hz+ 1 ms GTG+ GSYNC Support (After DIY Kit)+ 3D Vision Support+ Fully Adjustable Stand","Cons:- Colors aren't calibrated out of the box. Definitely needed some adjustment, but looked fine after configuring it, so no eggs lost here.- Didn't come with two more! :P","Other Thoughts:If you're getting this monitor to eventually install GSYNC, I can not recommend it enough. This is a fantastic monitor, great for gaming, especially if you can push the high framerates.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,A must have for every gamer enthusiast!,2014-03-13,"Pros:The colors are fantastic! The 144Hz for 3D is really nice for high end gaming, seems to have really helped my eyes from hurting after extended hours of playing games and watching movies. There are so many interesting features on this monitor, and I find myself using the cross hair overlay a lot more now, especially in games like Rust. Makes for more precise hip firing/melee hits in FPS games, no more spray and pray!","Cons:The tilting of the screen gets on my nerves at time since I'm very OCD about my screen being centered perfectly haha.. also if your going to use the screens speakers I suggest not doing so, they are quite terrible and quiet. (This wasn't a deciding factor in my purchase at all)",Other Thoughts:Never regretted buying this screen and no problems after months and months of use.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Calibration,2014-03-12,"Pros:144hz is amazing for shooters which I'm sure is a large majority  of the people that purchased this. Adjustability in the stand is great. Once tweaked, the picture is pretty good. See my settings in other thoughts for nvidia owners.","Cons:Picture out the box is AWFUL. Once tweaked still not perfect but ok. Contrast, gamma, and colors are not perfect. Makes me want to constantly upgrade video cards to run games above high settings at 144 fps. A 780 cannot max modern games at 144hz defeating the purpose of having 144hz :( .","Other Thoughts:If you have an nvidia card I suggest checking these settings out as I have played with them a lot and found this to be very good.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Color issues?,2014-03-12,"Pros:Good color* (see other thoughts), great features like push button menus, nice and bright.","Cons:One nit-picky thing (not worth an egg) and this goes to any other manufacturer reading this. Can I please for once get a good cable to accompany my 300$ monitor? Yes this monitor did come with a dual-link DVI that can support it at full 144 frames but it was very short, at least for my needs. I would think when shelling out cash for a high end monitor (this is high end to me) I would get at least a normal length cable.","Other Thoughts:I was not sure what to expect with all the other reviews talking about the horrendous color of this monitor. I wasn't really sure what to expect. Out of the box and on first boot this monitor was washed out and ugly. After a few hours of playing with settings in nVidia control panel, windows, and on the monitor itself I was able to get good even colors from it just how I like it. To give you an idea of that color quality I am comparing this with my old monitor Samsung SyncMaster S23B550. This is a 23 inch monitor with a TN panel as well. I think TN panels look fine. Then again I also used to think MP3 sounded fine until I heard .flac",0,0

The colors really stand out and the 1ms GTG works well for faster games or movies.,"Cons:$150 for the shutter glasses and the weak 3D support in games I play most make this a Pro and Con.  Im glad I didnt have to pay for the glasses to be included, but down the road this seems a little expensive to me.  As for the monitor itself, the only con i have found is the lack of labels for the buttons.  You just have to press them and figure it out I suppose!","Other Thoughts:Great monitor, would recommend to friends!",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,I love this monitor,2014-03-09,"Pros:Great picture, lots of settings and inputsI especially like the built in crosshair. I primarily play FPS, like BF4 and COD Ghosts, the crosshair feature gives me a significant advantage, and i like that alot!built in speakers are actually not that bad either. If I'm playing a casual game I will use them over my headset.","Cons:turning the volume for the speakers up and down is a pain. it's nested in the menu and takes 30s or so to get to the right place.A hot button would be nice, but nobody should buy this monitor for the built in speakers. No need to deduct an egg.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Simply beautiful,2014-03-07,"Pros:The picture is simply perfect, and the screen size is exactly what i was looking for. A great upgrade from my previous 21.5"" which seemed too ""widescreened"".I was actually considering a 27"", but that probably would've had the wide dilemma as well...","Cons:Not really cons, but:1:  Had an issue setting it up at first, but i think that was due to me not paying attention to where i was plugging in the cords... works great now though.2: Don't have your hand too close while using mouse/KB, an accidental bump can send the screen to the top position of its mount. It has a spring like feature that makes the monitor adjust it's height and it can easily be ""sprung"" right back to being ""too high"" while sitting in front of it. As long as you don't bump it on the bottom of the screen part of the monitor, it'll stay in place with no trouble.","Other Thoughts:Apart from the ""spring-like"" feature, this monitor is definitely worth getting.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Asus 144Hz,2014-03-06,Pros:This Monitor is the best I have owned.  144Hz over DVI or Displayport (not HDMI).  1ms response time.  Eccelent position adjustment options.,Cons:As many have said the out of the box settings are just wrong but this can be fixed with some time.,"Other Thoughts:When I first tuned this on I was a little upset by the picture.  It is a TN panel but still.  After checking some forums, downloading a new ICC & playing around with the settings I am now very satisfied.  I use the displayport connection and i did notice a small difference from DVI.  I would also make sure that whatever game you are playing is set to the correct refresh rate and/or use Vsync.  As I said above the height and pivot adjustments to the monitor are fantastic.  They are easy to move with litte effort but still stay firm.  If you are willing to do a little work (not much) to get the color setting right you will have a great gaming monitor.  I am 100% happy with my purchase.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,VG248QE,2014-03-05,"Pros:This is a very nice monitor, and the 1ms and 144hz is a much bigger difference than my old monitor. Games look amazing and crystal clear.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great monitor, might not be for everyone",2014-03-05,"Pros:Great stand, great brightness and clarity. great price point and is quite futureproof because of the lightboost technology and 3d capabilities if users want to upgrade without replacing hardware.","Cons:the only con is that the nature of having such a high refresh rate causes the colors to be either inaccurate or washed out. for me i thought it wouldnt bother me too much because i was fascinated with the capabilities of its refresh speed and clarity for fast paced games. I regret to inform you all that the accuracy of the colors is indeed something i wish for. none of the presets really represent a balanced display solution. its not HORRIBLE but it does bug me from time to time. at this point im willing to bear with it and just enjoy this great addition to any pc setup. so if you dont really play a lot of twitchy games like COD or perhaps driving games, i would suggest researching a bit more. if youre willing to put up with the color issues then by all means, this monitor is superb.",,2,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Buy,2014-02-23,"Pros:This was an upgrade from an old Acer 24"" monitor I had, so that could be the reason I love this monitor so much, but man, what a difference.  The combination of 1ms GTG + 144hz refresh made an unbelievable difference in gaming (what I do most).  The smoothness is  something you really need to experience to truly appreciate.  Tearing is virtually non existent, so there is no need to ever use v-sync anymore.Also, this monitor can get extremely bright.  I don't know anyone who would ever want their monitor to be so bright, but if that is your thing, this can do it.","Cons:I don't know if I would consider this a 'con', but you can't get the 144hz refresh rate with HDMI.Also, if your PC can't run a game with enough FPS, you won't get the benefits of the high refresh rate.  Again, this isn't really a con per se, but it is worth mentioning.","Other Thoughts:There are a lot of opinions out there regarding the benefits of the 144hz and what human eyes can actually see.  This is clearly a person-to-person issue.  Some people claim we can't see anything over 60FPS, and I'll tell you that is simply not always true - because I can.  I've tested this monitor numerous times with different games using 60hz refresh and the 144hz refresh, and there is a substantial difference in the smoothness and fluidity of the games.  Even simple things like the mouse cursor moving on-screen or dragging and moving a window around on the desktop are far smoother with a lot less flicker.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,All I hoped and more,2014-02-22,"Pros:I cant say enough about the difference 144hz makes.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,the best,2014-02-21,Pros:So far so good. I love the refresh rate and hz of this monitor and im glad i bought it. Although i got it for 200 for open box. Im glad i didnt hesitate to not buy it because it looks brand new and everything is in it. Newegg by far the best of everything.,Cons:This is slightly a con but the speaker is mostly a gimmick and the brightness of this thing is ridiculous but dont worry you can easily find a icc config for it over the internet.,Other Thoughts:I wish they put a usb instead of the speaker.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,5 eggs,2014-02-21,"Pros:Received the unit in three days without a mark on the box.Setup was simple but be sure to use the supplied DVI cable if you want the 144 hz refresh capability (I assure you that you do want it). You will also need a video card that can do 144 hz refresh (I purchased a ASUS GTX760-DC2OC-2GD5 GeForce GTX 760 and it works great).I wanted to set up a test where the differences were as minimal as I could arrange.I cloned the VG248 with an Asus VK246H (mid line model) monitor.Both are 24” units at 1600x900 resolution.The VG248 was running 144 hz and the VK246H was running 60 hz.The difference was night and day even using SD (standard definition) video. The ability to clone and freeze frame allows you to compare the smallest differences and believe me, the differences are glaring.Even text documents look sharper and the ability to rotate the screen 90 degrees lets you use programs like Pagemaker a joy.",Cons:Be aware that adding 3D will cost an additional $150. The 3D glasses are a wrap around style so will not be usable by someone that wears glasses (bummer).Active 3D is usually quite dark and can be a problem but Asus addresses this with a x2 brightness that easily illuminates your keyboard.,,0,0

Plenty!This monitor blows all other monitors out of the water with just the 144 Hz feature, but add in the ""splendid"" presets, especially the ""Game"" preset, and you get visuals that allow you to see the enemy before they see you in any good First Person Shooter (FPS) of choice.

I will update this review if I found something I don't like, or think is something to be worried about","Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor last week, after seeing a very high review rating. Then... I saw some of the reviews about the color being extremely bad right out of the box. I was extremely nervous about that. I pulled it out of the box today and got it setup (I must mention here, I am using a DISPLAYPORT CONNECTION, NOT HMDI) and I will tell you this, the color is ASTOUNDING! I couldn't believe how wonderful it looks. I think the DisplayPort connection is what this monitor is configured for, and maybe that could be the reason some people saw the color deficiencies. However, I have no idea if that is the case or not.  I would like to recommend to those who have trouble with their color to try the DisplayPort and see how it works for you.

I spent hours on hours researching this monitor before I purchased it. I was worried because a lot of people in reviews said that the colors were lacking. Honestly I can't tell. Sure there is a difference between a TN panel and a IPS panel side by side. But this monitor by itself is amazing. you do not notice the color difference. I would recommend this monitor especially for any one who enjoys a first person shooter or good immersion with no screen tearing.,Cons:Speakers are mediocre at best.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,For the CS Gamers! (jumping from 60hz),2014-01-22,"Pros:The Refresh Rate is wonderful. For those who want to jump from a 60 hz display to a 144 hz display. This is the entry level monitor, and is a definite steal for the price.Out of the box you get a Dual Link DVI cord, Drivers for the monitor (which I haven't installed as it's just Nvidia Software for 3D use), and the monitor/stand.The stand works perfectly and is easily attachable.As for general gaming, the 144hz refresh rate is wonderful. And the option to switch to a gaming mode on your monitor is a nice plus. The response rate is also wonderful.. So yes.. It's worth the upgrade for those who want to upgrade from 60. Not 120Hz though.","Cons:Generally speaking, the colors aren't wonderful. I'm definitely no color buff. Actually, I could care less for aesthetics and colors. I just wanted this monitor for gaming.. But the colors were definitely not the same as my 60hz. The Blacks were not nearly as good, this is noticeable when viewing videos.

The screen quality is excellent, the 144hz refresh rate is so silky smooth I even enjoy watching my mouse pointer move across the screen!I am very particular about the stands on monitors, I don't like ones that are relatively small and wobbly, nevertheless the stand on this monitor is extremely sturdy and well built. It also offers a large range of motion which I find to be very beneficial. The Red accents also look good too.I enjoy the included selectable cross-hairs you can put on the screen, there are four of them to choose from and they have greatly improved my accuracy in games like CS:GO.I like the fact I can plug my headphones into it. Speaking of sound, the speaker in it is OK. I did not buy this monitor because it had a speaker, regardless for what it is, the speaker does pretty good. Obviously because of its size it wont have any low-end so don't expect amazing sound out of it.It includes the correct cable for 144hz operation.Has a selection of modern video connections (no vga).The packaging was excellent, almost every surface on the thing had a protective plastic film on it.A great monitor.","Cons:Only two minor cons. The thing attracts dust incredibly well (not really a con but I had to say something), the menu button layout isn't exactly intuitive, but you get used to it. Other than that its great.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this monitor. It all comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for.Haven't tried the 3d vision yet, but I plan to eventually.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,The monitor for YOU,2014-01-17,"Pros:NO Image Burn whatsoever (which translate to a quality lasting image), Amazing Refresh Rate, Vivid Color, Bright, Plenty of Settings, Clear and Crisp Image, Large Size but most of it is legitimate screen space, really easy setup, everything you need comes in the box (Audio & DVI cords, stand, screen, etc.)","Cons:The only disappointment I had when setting them up is that the DVI cords weren't long enough to reach my computer, but that's my fault because my unit is placed so far away from the monitors. SO, IN OTHER WORDS: NO CONS.","Other Thoughts:I had been looking at monitors for a year and a half, researching both in-store at various places as well as online. I decided to buy these monitors and am totally glad I did. Newegg, as usual, got the monitors to me a day early without a scratch on the boxes or anything. I upgraded from two 19"" full-screen monitors (1280x1024 VGA Standard Def), and let me tell you, once I had my new monitors set up (I bought two of these), it was love at first sight. The refresh rate is incredible and really does make a difference. For those of you that say, ""144Hz is for those picky gamers"", let me tell you how wrong that statement is. While I admit I do some gaming, I also program games, do graphic design, and do a lot of video editing, and it makes a huge difference in all of those areas. You can even see the difference just by moving the mouse around. The screens are bright at first, but you can turn that down if you want. Other thing: I have two AMD HD Radeon 6670's, and while the monitor is advertised for use with NVidia graphics cards, every feature also works with AMD graphics cards, so as long as your GPU supports HD, you should notice performance you didn't think capable of your current Graphics Card.",1,1

Excellent colours and contrasts. Easily on par with the Samsung series 5 that it has just replaced on my desk. Response time and refresh rate are superb and, as you may have heard, really do make a noticeable difference when gaming (at least in first person shooters). Very easy to assemble and use. A pretty wonderful, basically flawless experience in these regards.","Cons:Two that instantly come to mind, one small one major.The minor issue is that, while easy enough to use, the push buttons make getting at volume control laborious. Like I said, not a huge deal, but a pretty basic design error.The huge deal though is the in built speaker. It's not of particularly good sound quality, but that's not what concerns me. When directing audio through the monitor, even when playing no audio file/source at all, there is a very audible buzzing sound that increases considerably relative to the volume setting.Even when passing the cursor over youtube videos (no interaction further that that) there is a slight change (increase) in the buzzing. It plays distinctly from any in-use audio too. Even on the Battlefield 4 pause screen in game, it is incredibly loud.Not an issue if you're using speakers perhaps, but still a glaring and infuriating  design flaw. I'm not sure if it's low quality components, or a faulty unit, but I RMA'd the first monitor I received for this reason. I received the replacement today and it does the same, albeit not as loud as the first one. I'm gong to try external speakers, but if the buzzing persists, I'll be getting my money back.","Other Thoughts:Slightly off-topic but relevant to my RMA of this item: Newegg sent me a defective product first time around that they shipped to me for a fee of $8. To send a broken item back to them cost me $53. They also haven't replied to either of my emails regarding this matter, both dated and received more than a month ago (they say they respond within 24 hours). Terrible service. Send me a broken item and charge me almost seven times the shipping to return their mistake to them then ignore my requests for said money to be refunded to me. I won't be buying big things here again.",4,1

My friend had suggested this monitor instead, and I figured I would listen to him (this one was cheaper and seemed to have more features that the one I had chosen).I am so glad that I listened to him. Everything looks incredibly crisp and clear, the swivel and monitor tilting abilities make it just that much more sweeter. the fact that it sits on a circular base make turning it incredibly easy.Was impressively easy to set up (simply snap the base on and you're good to go)I have not gotten to a chance to use the 3D capabilities, yet, though....The 144Hz helps make everything so beautiful compared to","Cons:The only thing I could say (miniscule as it may be) is I wish the monitor base had a 360° swivel instead of the (seems to be) 120° swivel it has now.Not worth an egg loss, though.",,0,0

I was pretty mad about it, however with about 10 minutes or so it went away somehow and has been perfect every since which is why I am giving it 4/5 just for the simple fact I might have to RMA if it comes back up, and also because if you spend 300usd on a monitor the last thing you want to see is a dead pixel.Also $53 for APO Shipping is a little crazy.","Other Thoughts:If you built a pretty powerful system like me and havent gotten a monitor that goes  over 60hz I promise you, you are not getting the eye candy you were hopeing for.

The colors pop out, the quick refresh rate makes everything appear to move smoothly (even the mouse cursor!), and the resolution is perfect for movies/games/etc.",Cons:Took some tweaking of the preset modes to get the picture to look great without burning out my retinas. Also I could only take advantage of the 144hz in a few games as my graphics card is older but that's my fault really. The speakers on the monitor don't have the best quality sound either but good enough for casual users.,"Other Thoughts:I recommend only getting this monitor if you have a very high performance GPU that is compatible with all of the monitor's bells and wistles.

However, if you are coming from a traditional 60hz model (~99% of flat-screen monitors sold in the last 15 years), it will blow you away.Windows desktop is smooth, browser scrolling is readable, gaming (provided you have a GPU setup that can push up to 120-144fps) is astoundingly smooth. Racing games have become easier because the road and objects in the far distance are clearer making high speed decisions easier.Even StarCraft II and RPG's like Mass Effect have a smoother quality to them.24"" isn't the biggest monitor out there, but it's definitely a good size.Color recreation is about as good as you can get for a TN model, though, trust me, it's nothing close to an IPS (which I have sitting next to it).However TO GET this mostly-accurate color representation you will need to spend some serious time tweaking it as well as installing a proper ICC profile.  If you're reading this and think you can skip knowing what an ICC profile is, or how to install/tweak it, YOU CANT. See my con's for more details","Cons:I have FIVE major issues with this monitor:First, is the button positioning. Because you're going to have to spend serious time adjusting the settings on this thing (see more below), having the buttons on the underside of the screen is awful.Second, THE SPEAKER IS AWFUL! And I mean, truly abysmal.  Even on full blast, you can't hear it and when you do, the sound representation is terrible. I'm not saying that it's terrible compared to some previous sound bar or speaker I had, I mean, this is noticeably terrible sounding all on it's own. If you were looking for a monitorThird is the color representation. The monitor comes with about 6 or 7 preset color modes, all of which are terrible. Ranging from very washed out to ridiculously over-saturated and over-constrast.The -best- mode is the sRBG mode, but for whatever stupid reason, they LOCK OUT all customization of that preset. Other presets have similar setting-lock-out's as well, but usually only 1 or two settings. Disabling ANY settings for tweaking in a preset mode is a bad idea to me, honestly.Most of the other modes are kinda pointless, the 'gaming' mode makes dark area's impossible to see and several are just silly such as 'night' mode which does nothing but lower the brightness and create washed out colors.You MUST install the ICC color profile for this monitor on your computer. There is the one on the included-CD rom, but then there is another, better, one you can find with a google search.Even after installing that ICC profile, which is used more to make sure the colors on your screen are the ones that appear when you PRINT out something, you still need to do a LOT of tweaking. I spent probably a grand total of 10-15 hours over the course of a week, tweaking this to a point where I no longer wished to return it.And even after all that work, your reds will look pinkish to orange and certain shades of grey will come out either blue or brown. These two things cannot be avoided whatsoever on this monitor.Fourth, the viewing angles are  terrible. Even if you are dead center on the monitor, you'll notice dark scenery at the top, bottom and both sides, will over-darken. Color swap (when a color changes as you move your viewing angle) is quite severe. These poor viewing angles make using this monitor in Portrait mode (popular in multi-monitor setups)....utterly useless. If you need this sort of setup, buy an IPS and give up on high refresh-rate models.Fifthly, and lastly, the gradation of solid colors is terrible. When a color is gradually faded from one shade to another shade of the same color (such as the sky during a sunset as you move from the bright sun to the dark overhead sky) you will see sudden and abrupt bands of color instead of a nice smooth gradual shift from one shade, or luminosity, to another.","Other Thoughts:There is a 'game' mode (not to be confused with the game color preset) that displays a crosshair on the screen like some kind of modified on-screen-display.This crosshair stays on it even when you leave a game and go to windows or a web page. I'm not sure WHY this feature was even included because 100% of shooting games, dating back to 1993, have some form of a crosshair already in the game.There is also an on-screen time in this mode as well. The problem is that the timer can't be customized to any intervals except 30-60-90 seconds. This makes it a no go for many RTS players, though it would work well for Quake Live players.The monitor stand needs to be taller. When rotated into portrait mode, the monitor stand must be at max height to accommodate. This prevents any height adjustment when in this position, which is a problem considering the severe limitation of viewing angles on this monitor.Another thought, is that the speakers for this monitor are on the back, near the stand's mount plate. This is very inconvenient for people who want to plug/unplug head phones into it.OVERALLThis monitor is a great, high speed monitor that takes a lot of tweaking to get the color to acceptable levels. By no means will it ever have great color representation. Viewing angles are among the worst I've seen and this makes the monitor unusable in portrait mode. The speaker is awful so make sure you have your own set already. The other gimmicks are just that, gimmicks and aren't something anyone will use.TL;DRIf you are used to IPS monitors, you will hate this. If you want good speakers, look elsewhere. If you want high refresh rate, and that is the ONLY thing you need, you've found your monitor.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Buy,2014-01-12,"Pros:Awesome monitor, super smooth.","Cons:None, knowing the limitations of TN.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is meant for gaming, and it definitely delivers.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent screen for gaming and everything else,2014-01-10,"Pros:If you are looking for the ideal gaming monitor, then you may have found it.  This panel excels in almost every area that matters.  The LED backlight is very bright and effective.  There is a TON of user control options available so the screen can be tweaked to your liking.Now to the important part: gaming.  If you're like most PC gamers, we are coming from playing on standard 60 Hz panels.  Now get ready to game with a 144 Hz refresh rate.  The fluidity and responsiveness is amazing.  Pair this with a powerful graphics card and you may never see the need for a console again.  BF3 is a different experience with such silky smooth movement and lack of input lag.  It really will enable you to play better.  Every game I have played on this monitor is that much smoother, with little to no input lag or screen tearing.  It is absolutely noticeable and I don't think I could go back to a vanilla 60 Hz monitor.","Cons:There are a few gripes, but they are relatively minor.  Once I got past my amazement, I noticed the colors were WAY out of whack.  This is where Asus stumbles a little.  All of the presets are either oversaturated, too bright, or just plain bad looking.  Luckily, you can manually change the colors as well as download preset ICC profiles that take the guesswork out of the adjustments.  (Just google the monitor model name and ICC profiles)  It's actually easy to do.","Other Thoughts:This monitor really is the pinnacle of 1080p technology.  There are higher resolutions out there as well as some beautiful ISP panels that put the LCD screens on this and other panels to shame.  However, 1440p comes at a huge price premium and ISP panels simply can't reach the refresh and response times as this LCD TN panel can.  There will be something better than this at some point... that's how technology works.  However, with this monitor clocking in well under $300 with all that it offers to PC gamers, you can't do much better.  As a plus, this particular monitor is fully eligible to be upgraded with Nvidia's forthcoming G-Sync upgrade kit.  Anyone with a screwdriver and a basic knowledge of modding will be able to take advantage of this new feature that will make this monitor even more buttery smooth.This panel isn't perfect, but its close enough.  Don't pass it up if you're in the market for a new monitor.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Almost perfect,2014-01-10,Pros:- Great response time and refresh rate @ 144Hz- BRIGHT!!!- All kinds of digital inputs- Can be upgraded to support G-sync,Cons:- Needs some time to calibrate and get used to- Displayport has some problem that you have to keep in mind,"Other Thoughts:[Displayport No Signal]2 days ago I had a very strange experience with a dead displayport.Windows would show all the booting screens then the screen goes blank saying ""Displayport No Signal"". However when I boot into my hackintosh, or the safe mode in Windows, everything works fine.I spent 2 days troubleshooting the Windows installation fruitless, including reinstalling. I then ordered a mini-displayport to standard cable just to try the port with my Mac mini - also not working. This made me think maybe the port on the monitor was broken, and a RMA was the next step.Then I thought maybe the monitor is not passing EDID information via DP and tried the one (un)obvious thing that I forgot to - power-cycle the monitor - yeah, you'd never think you have to power-cycle a monitor to fix a problem. So I unplugged the monitor’s power cord， waited 10 seconds, then plugged it back in and... huh, the DP port is alive again.So, this was my experience with the DP port and maybe it will help someone who runs into this same problem.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Good monitor,2014-01-10,Pros:The 144hz montior is awesome for gaming if you have the monitor to play your game at such high fps. I only play Bf4 and as well all might know the game is buggy but with this monitor and a good powerful gpu the game runs smooth. 60hz compared to 144hz/120hz is a no brainer upgrade immediately if your plan on doing it.,Cons:The colors aren't the best neither is the inputs when changing modes from dvi to hdmi.,"Other Thoughts:It also has speakers that are decent which is a plus, i don't have to keep unplugging my set of speakers when changing modes since i only have one for now.. the built in speakers are loud enough to watch some youtube videos",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Just buy it.,2014-01-10,"Pros:After I built my pc a year ago I went with a 60hz acer monitor with which I experienced screen tearing,  bland colors and terrible viewing angles.  I finally decided I had to get an upgrade.  This monitor wont disappoint, the colors are so vivid and at 144hz there is virtually no screen tearing.  Definitely a gaming monitor,, but he videos and movies look beautiful on it.  Oh and the OSD crosshairs and timer features are totally cool/helpful.-easy to calibrate-stunning picture quality for a reasonable price-sturdy adjustable stand-light boost technology-Great menu interface",Cons:Seriously... there is nothing more I could ask for out of this monitor,Other Thoughts:Just make sure you have a video card that will use this monitor to is full potential.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,It works.  Needs calibration.,2014-01-10,Pros:It works!,Cons:Very very very bright and washed out colors straight out of the box.  Definitely need to calibrate this monitor and load an ICC profile,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Highly recommended,2014-01-09,"Pros:Gorgeous screen with special features for gamers (a button on the screen itself that imposes an aiming reticle/target deadcenter on the screen, works at the advertised 144Hz with my GTX 780ti, bright, perfect size for a monitor, best value out there if you are looking for a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor, great swiveling base and screen.  Love it.",Cons:None?,"Other Thoughts:Oh yes and it comes with a Dual Link DVI-D cable which you must use to achieve the 144Hz refresh rate.  The other way to do it is with a special high end HDMI cable (I believe it is called HDMI 1.4) that they sell for 120-240Hz televisions.  I bought a 4 foot one for $75 (bargained down from $95!) before I took the monitor out of the box because I assumed there would be no cable.  Now I can go return that silly expensive HDMI cable.  Using the dual link DVI is working just fine, but obviously doesn't transfer sound like HDMI does.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great Monitor, but needs adjusted",2014-01-09,"Pros:I really like this monitor. i've only had it for a short time, but it is one of the best monitors that I have ever owned. The picture is great, and with the high refresh rate and 1ms response time, everything looks a lot smoother.","Cons:Like a lot of people have said, the stock calibration comes a bit hot. I had to turn down the brightness and adjust the contrast. Once i had those dialed in though, it's perfect.","Other Thoughts:Aside from the stock calibration, this is an amazing monitor. If you're a bit OCD like I am, then you probably plan on dialing in your own settings anyways :)",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Nice Monitor,2014-01-08,Pros:1)  It can be very bright if you want.2)  High 144 hzIt does everything as advertised.,Cons:1)  Just a touch too bright out of the box.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,issues... NONE,2014-01-08,Pros:144hz is awesome. Colors look great after some mild adjustments.,Cons:Out of the box the colors and brightness were offa. Ater about 15 min of tinkering with Color Adjustment within Windows and the Nvidia control panel the monitor  has come to life. I have never received a monitor out of the box that was ever set properly to MY liking and nobody ever will.,Other Thoughts:For all those out there with issues with color and brightness just YouTube it. I'm sorry it takes time but so did The Lord when he made Earth.,1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Game Changer,2014-01-07,"Pros:-Very fast refresh rate-Looks great-Great gaming and other user functions-Should be able to eventually upgrade to G-sync w/ DIY kit from nvidia-Love the static crosshairs that can be selected from monitor menu.  Gives almost unfair advantage when shooting from the hip in BF3 and other FPS-As always, fast order processing and turnaround on Newegg's part","Cons:-Slightly pricey-Some may complain that this doesn't give great true color as it's a TN monitor, but not an issue for me as my main purpose for purchasing is for gaming-Snowpocalypse in Detroit delayed delivery (not really a con), but my university closed so I could enjoy my new monitor the day it came :P","Other Thoughts:-Could tell an immediate - and drastic - difference in gameplay when switching from 60Hz Samsung monitor.  Have only had for a couple of hours, but first impression tells me I will be very happy with my purchase for some time.  If this changes I will update review.-Can't wait to play CS:GO w/ this new monitor.-Likely will never use built in speakers; probably shouldn't have included bc they just add weight and most ppl won't use them.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Excellent for gaming,2014-01-07,"Pros:1. High refresh rate, this means less motion blur, and less input lag (there's even less input lag when using vsync compared to a 60hz monitor, because the gpu has more than half as long to wait between refreshes). Using vsync at 120 or 144hz basically adds no perceptible input lag, meaning no ugly tearing and very responsive at the same time.2. Has a very nice adjustable stand. can easily adjust the height of the monitor.3. The menu buttons are on the front and clearly labelled. too many monitors have this hidden away and not even labelled making it a PIA to navigate the monitor's OSD, I found it very easy on this one.","Cons:The default calibration on this monitor is ridiculously bad. There are barely any words to describe how awful this monitor looks when you first turn it on, it made me want to gauge my eyes out with a spoon. By default the brightness, contrast, and colors are all ramped up as high as possible, the picture basically looks like its insanely bright and washed out, it was literally the worst looking colors I've ever seen on a monitor, and I'm used to TN panels.This monitor is capable of looking on par with most other TN panels, but its clear that Asus made absolutely no attempt to make this look good out of the box. This has been my experience with other asus panels too, always absurdly bright and washed out by default, but look fine after tweaking.","Other Thoughts:Its only the default colors that are awful, but by tweaking the settings and using an icm profile as suggested online, the colors are fine and on par with any other TN panel I've used, and imo better than my previous asus TN panel (which was an asus vh226h).For the monitor settings I used:Brightness: 24Contrast: 60Red: 100Green: 95Blue: 84Trace Free: 40and for the ICM profile I used (google it): VG248QE144hzFinal.icmNote: I've seen other reviewers say that using an icm profile did not help. This is true, but only because applying an icm profile in windows is ridiculously convoluted: when you browse to the icm file in the windows color management control panel, and hit set it as default *nothing will happen*, even after reboot. To get it to actually apply properly, you need to go here from the color management window: Advanced > Change system defaults > Add the profile again in this color management window and set it as default > advanced > check the box that says ""Use windows display calibration"". After doing this you should clearly see that the color profile has applied (this worked for me in windows 8.1).",6,0

Some might say the colors aren't the greatest but it's a TN panel.  What do you expect?Out of the box the settings are pretty bad.  Calibrate them yourself or download an ICC profile and it's fine.,Other Thoughts:If you don't know what 2d gaming with lightboost does it's basically the h0ly (newegg wouldn't let me use an O there...) grail of fps gaming.

Made a big difference in the look and feel of my new games. Running Win 8.1 on a Nvidia GT 780 looks amazing on screen. Totally different experience from my last rig.",Cons:None.,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,ASUS warranty is meaningless,2013-12-17,Pros:ASUS monitors look great when they are working.,"Cons:Don't expect to use that 3 year warranty from ASUS.  Long story short, it's been over 43 days and I still haven't gotten a replacement for my broken monitor.This story is from my experiences with a different ASUS model, but I feel my interaction with ASUS support will be informative when considering this display too.  My monitor began randomly turning off after an hour or so (overheating?) making it impossible to use it for games or movies.  After troubleshooting every possibility with ASUS support, they had me send it in on RMA.  When I got the monitor back a week later it had the same problem!  After talking with ASUS support again, it turns out their techs didn't even touch my monitor.  Apparently they didn't read my description of the problem clearly stating that it took some time before the monitor would malfunction.  Rather than send it in for another RMA with the possibility of having the problem ignored again, the ASUS support staffer suggested I swap it for a refurbished model using their cross-shipping program.  I agreed and they said they would send an email with instructions within 48h.  Four days later there's no email, so I called them up.  Turns out my model isn't in stock anymore so they were trying to find a replacement model and promised to email me in 48h.  Three days later, no email.  I called again and they gave the same story and blamed the delay on ASUS corporate not responding to their emails (!?!).  When I asked to speak to a supervisor they transferred me to a voice mail.  It's been over 43 days since I first contacted ASUS support and I've called them over half a dozen times in the last month with no results.If you plan on buying this monitor just don't put any weight into the warranty or support they claim to provide.","Other Thoughts:As a counter example, Newegg's customer support is great and always very quick.",9,10
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Good Monitor,2013-12-16,"Pros:It runs at 144Hz, great stand and 3d/light vision supported. Buttons and onscreen menu are good, rotates any way you want it.","Cons:Colors are disgusting, pixels look blocky/stripey sometimes when at certain viewing angles. Not a very nice panel overall, but it runs at 144Hz which is what I wanted. I purchased this before G-Sync was announced so that was a bit of a disappointment as G-Sync was announced 3 weeks after my purchase.",,6,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,impressive,2013-12-15,Pros:Really good card with lot of power an really quiet in operation I play to battlefield 4 everything set a ultra and no sound from the card! I'm very satisfied of my purchase and I got 3 games for free thx nvidia! very more powerful than a normal 780 gtx and great cooling too!,Cons:the only cons is the price but with this kind of monsters it's the price to pay for obtain something really good!,,0,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,works as described,2013-12-15,"Pros:Works on all emulators with my iPod touch 4th gen (jailbroken). Love how this version has the media buttons, it has come in handy for volume a few times while playing","Cons:Setup at first was a little difficult, but working flawlessly now","Other Thoughts:If you are running an iOS device, I would recommend getting the blutrol app from cydia.Note to future buyers with iOS devices, to connect device for first use. Hold the B button down for 3 sec. Then press the home button then release both. Connect with iPod, then to reconnect just press home for 2 sec then click B. if I connects for a moment then disconnect try last steps again.",0,10

BUT once you install the correct ICC profile then the picture quality is ridiculously good. The viewing angle is that great but the actual picture quality will amaze you.

Makes a difference in shooters and even on the desktopConsole games look sharpBuilt in speakers while not the best, decent enough for console games","Cons:Colors. These colors are washed out! While everybody keeps getting reminded of the ICC profile to fix colors, it works on desktop but it does not always work while playing certain games! It's frustrating that I have to deal with these washed out colors while playing a shooter! It makes it look dull and sometimes even hard to tell if i'm looking at an object or a person. Unless I can get the ICC profile working in all games i'm considering returning it!",Other Thoughts:It was so good until I realized how bad the colors were. Because of that I took an egg off,0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Very Nice,2013-12-12,Pros:Very sleek design. Came wrapped and secure with scratch proof laminate. Resolution and color is utterly AMAZING. I switched from a 32 inch Sony TV from 4 years ago. So the difference is very clear.,"Cons:It came with ONE dead pixel which imo, isn't a big deal. It's only noticeable when on a white screen. Playing games I can't tell, which I usually am always playing games on the computer.","Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a very nice monitor with superb resolution and color, gaming, or just like to watch movies, this is the one for you.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,,2013-12-11,Pros:Colors and brightness are good enough for the price. Image seems sharp enough I too. It's certainly better than my previous monitor.,Cons:I've only had one issue with it so far but it may be my fault. For some reason it seems that I can't adjust the size of the display image to take up the entire monitor. There's probably a half an inch on the sides and a good quarter inch at the top of unused screen at the monitors max resolution. I've tried adjusting this in the monitors settings to no avail as the OSD settings seem to only move the menu itself around and not the actual display image.,Other Thoughts:I only took one egg off for this issue that I haven't been able to solve through Googling thus far. I've seen that Asus seems to be fairly good about responding to customer issues on here so if one of their reps should respond to this with w/e the information I need (but have been unable to find thus far) I'll happily add another egg on.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best for $$$,2013-12-10,"Pros:Cant beat the price with a lead pipe.Bright, colorful, and sleek design.60hz, 120hz or 144hz.Love the stand, raise up and down, tilt option and swivel.3D is awesome!Best GAMING monitor out there for the price!","Cons:Wall mounters will have to mod the back to mount. (no biggy, i love the stand).Speakers are in the rear. (I dont care, i use 5.1 speakers.)","Other Thoughts:First and foremost, this IS a GAMING monitor.The price per quality and design. Less of the wall mount optional and speakers being in the rear. Youre not going to find a better 120hz 3D monitor anywhere, probably even today. (i bought this a year ago).As far as colors out of the box, c'mon, what monitor have you ever bought where you didnt have to change the colors, even minor changes. Mine in particular was minor.This is a TN Panel, NOT IPS. IPS will never be 120hz. Google it.Hz... for those of you who know, u can skip this, for those who think they know, google it after you read. Dual Link is a dead cable, the only reason they keep it, is for people who dont want to buy new monitors. HDMI is fine for computers but it does NOT support 120hz, let alone 144hz (EXCEPT version 1.4b) WITH which i might add you need a monitor that also supports 1.4b HDMI. This is NOT that monitor. Of little importance HDMI also loses digital info over lengths of 6 feet i believe, regardless, who has there tower 6 feet from there monitor? Anyways, its still a gaming monitor and with gaming comes graphics cards, so more than likely gamers have a big fat card with a Display Port, which does support 120hz and 144hz. I believe it goes all the way up to 240hz (dont quote me on 240hz, lol)As the source, graphics cards use the 120hz refresh rate of the monitor for the Frames Per Second of the application in use, i.e. a video game.The 120hz TV is a gimmick to sell you a TV. Cable and satellite are recorded and or broadcast in 33hz. DVDs and Blu-Ray are recorded at 33hz. PS3 and XBox 360 i believe are recorded at 60hz. HDMI works fine on it because nothing going through is more than 60hz.So unless you use your 50"" tv for your computer, that 120hz doesnt come into play. Sure its there, but you'll never use it. Which from what i understand, there are very limited tv's with Display Port to even utilize the 120hz.Bottom line, you need a graphics card that pushes 120 FPS, a Display Port to Display Port Cable, a monitor that supports both 120hz, Display Port and an application to use it, which would be almost any PC video game.As for the 3D, I saw the ""ghosting"", but it was minimal and you really have to look for it. Mostly its when either a very dark object in the foreground is on a very bright background or vis versa. So if you have a game that is like that alot, you'll probably notice it more often than not. Even so, its tolerable.My Rig (1 year old)CPU: Intel i-5 3570K 3.4 oced 4.5 @ 1.25v (68° C full loadenclosed liquid cooled push/pull fans)MB: Asus P8Z77-V LK LGA 1155 Intel Z77RAM: 2 x 4Gig Corsair DominatorsVCARD: 2 x SLI Nvidia (EVGA) GTX 660 Ti OCPSU: Corsair CX750 wattTower: Thermaltake Commander (white)Fans: 6",2,3
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Truly amazing with minor issue.,2013-12-09,Pros:-Fairly slim-Bright enough-Response time is great. 144hz is superb.  Just about the best thing that has ever happened to my computer.-Can tilt if needed and holds position well.-Will make any game that requires a fine touch or twitch skill a lot more fun and you'll improve your game!,"Cons:-Viewing angle is not great. You pretty much have to point it at you to not see color change or dimming.-Color reproduction is not great.  You'll really see it in rough gradients and certain blacks come off as green.  This is where it loses an egg.  Were it like my Samsung in color reproduction it would have 5 stars.  That being said I'd still suggest, nay implore any of my friends to buy one.-Using the menu is a bit challenging or at least annoying.  Took me a while to come up with a configuration that satisfied me.  Out of box it's not beautiful.-Wish there were a 27"" version!","Other Thoughts:I've not yet used the 3d capabilities even though I think it would be awesome.  The cost of the glasses is just too much at the moment and the reviews for them are hit and miss.  Nice to have the capacity for 3d though if the time comes when a great pair of glasses comes out, and doesn't bankrupt me lol.Remember: this is a gaming monitor; if you are hoping to use photoshop, watch movies or do video editing you may very well be disappointed.Spend the time it takes to set it up right.  Make sure you have the DVI cable hooked up to utilize the 144 hz refresh rate as it does not work with HDMI.  I improved my fps gaming skill by at least 30 percent in the first hour of playing and if you have some interest in PC gaming and have the 300 dollars to shell out, buy it; you won't be disappointed!",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,bought these on sale,2013-12-08,Pros:i bought 2 of these when they were on sale plus newegg sent out a $40 discount and it was well worth it. screen is crisp clean looking bright and ive never had an taring due to the 144hz refresh rate.  swivel bases so they are easy to change angle. i havent used 3d yet. Also for gamers when gsync comes out these monitors are cable or should i say will be when you purchase the kit,Cons:not enough to loose an egg but they attract dust like crazy i wiped down mine yesterday and i already see more dust. (i actively clean and vac my house ever 2-3 days due to my shedding dogs,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Responsive, Fast, Blue.",2013-12-07,"Pros:This Monitor has proved you can get alot of everything.  Packing 144 Hz, 3D vision 2, and G-sync (kit required) This Monitor will definitely stay with me until it dies.","Cons:A slight con, the Hues are slightly blueish, this bug can easily be fixed by the Monitor's slightly confusing controls.",Other Thoughts:Definitely will acquire a G-Sync Kit for this Monitor.I would definitely recommend this for anyone ESPECIALLY those with a Nvidia card as it has compatibility with all of Nvidia's features to date.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Gaming Monitor EVER,2013-12-07,"Pros:I had a Sceptre 24"" 60 Hz monitor prior to this, and the differences are clear and evident. This monitor runs at a 144 Hz refresh rate and provides a smoother picture quality while gaming. The colors are vibrant, and it has the ability to raise and swivel.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Fantastic,2013-12-07,Pros:Looks great after downloading color profile,"Cons:way to bright out of the box, colors are to vivid and overstaturated. fixed after using profile from this site :pcmonitors.info/reviews/asus-vg248qe","Other Thoughts:I took a gamble on this i bought it open box, i was worried it may have dead pixels or some defects. display was not even used everything was still in original packaging , all the sticky plastic was still covering all the edges of screen and back side. nothing was missing and everything was mint. and got it for a great price. this is second item iv bought open box, first was a motherboard, both purchases have been exceptional",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent Monitor - BUT,2013-12-07,"Pros:This is an excellent monitor capable of displaying the high framerates that you want in high-end gamingThe stand is easy to set up, and the screen pivots on the x(to a lesser extent) y and z axes in addition to height adjustment, making this a really versatile monitor.","Cons:The ghosting and motion blur out of the box are horrible, but this monitor becomes truly excellent with just some extra software, that will completely eliminate said motion blur and ghosting. More on this on 'other thoughts'","Other Thoughts:I HIGHLY recomment that you install ToastyX's strobelight - lightboost utility if you want this monitor to become truly spectacular. It adds a strobelight effect to the back light that essentially makes it behave like a crt monitor, this is what makes the motion blur and ghosting completely disappear, and you won't ever want to go back.Here's the link, and enjoy: http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Strobelight-LightBoost-Utility-for-AMD-ATI-and-NVIDIA",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,First gaming monitor. Very good so far.,2013-12-05,"Pros:This has been a great upgrade from my tiny 17 inch monitor. It is super clear and i love having 1080p. I have a dual setup now and i am glad i picked this as my main monitor. If i had a 150$ cheaper monitor i don't know if i could justify any sort of upgrade. I don't know if i notice the difference with the 1ms response time. I really like the picture quality but i hope i can use it better. I is a bit bright, even at lowest brightness if all your light are out it can be a bit of an eye strain.",Cons:Wish it was easier to control the volume. When i was using this with my Xbox you have to go through about 5 menu's to change the volume which was really annoying. I know the speakers are just there to add as a feature and are super cheap but i wish they were easier to use. Also HDMI only goes to 60Hz.,"Other Thoughts:Really good monitor, not sure if i can justify having 2 of these i might buy a cheaper monitor for my second one unless this goes on a good sale. $280 is super expensive for a monitor and i could get a semi-big TV for this cost. I hope when i do some more serious gaming i can fully utilize the 144Hz and 1ms response time. Using this for league of legends hasn't affected anything.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great monitor at a semi affordable price,2013-12-05,"Pros:This is the speedy Gorgonzola of displays, as it's advertised to be. It is also extremely affordable (comparitively) to other higher refresh rate monitors, such as a BenQ solution. The rotation, height adjustment, and pivot system work extraordinarily well, even though they stay sturdy when you put them in a position, you don't have to fight the monitor to move it's display. Another thing I love is the buttons on the bottom of the display, they actually protrude from the chassis, which is increasingly rare but I always like to see things like this.","Cons:The colors on this monitor aren't the best I've ever used, but they also aren't terrible by any means, but I guess that's the trade-off one has to make when buying an extremely snappy monitor, like this one.","Other Thoughts:ASUS really do know how to make some great products, and I would count this as one of them, it has some issues, the most glaring being color accuracy, but what it does, it does excruciatingly well. That being extremely fast paced gaming.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Solid Product,2013-12-05,"Pros:Crisp picture, low eye-strainZero glare whatsoever (seriously, it's amazing)Good response timeExtremely adjustable (rotation, tilt, height, pitch)",Cons:Required some slight setting tweaking out of the box. The ICC profile I found on the pcmonitors review of this product was an instant fix.,Other Thoughts:Has handled a few months of near-constant use being powered by a nvidia gtx 780. G,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Pretty good,2013-12-05,"Pros:-High brightness (max)-Decent speakers (better than most onboard monitor speakers)-Okay colour representation-144 Hz makes games/movies look super smooth-1ms response makes it an ideal gaming monitor-3D is a nice added bonus-Crazy amount of flexibility with height, rotation adjustments. Feels super solid.","Cons:-Bad light leaking (on a black screen, you can see the light leaking from the sides)-Greens/Blues are a bit too strong",Other Thoughts:Overall a good monitor for the price. For a gamer I'd say it's a must to have a high refresh rate monitor. I'll probably be ordering 2 more for a triple monitor setup as the bevels are of a decent size and you can even do a 3 vertical setup without buying a mount.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Absolutely Amazing,2013-12-04,"Pros:- 144hz- Display Port (using--best option btw), DVI-D, HDMI- Great resolution- Smoothness- Boosted FPS substantially- Best for gamers- Worth every penny (sale or not)","Cons:- Color takes a bit of time to adjust, but still looks good in the end","Other Thoughts:If your GPU supports Displayport or DVI-D, it's very possible you need this monitor if you aren't using a huge CRT one. This monitor is for gamers...anyone who does simple web browsing, coding, editing, etc. should not get this monitor simply because it's a waste for you.Gamers will benefit from increased FPS gains or, in dummy terms: Smoother gameplay. You are not going to utilize the full 144hz if your GPU doesn't support it, or you aren't using a Displayport or DVI-D cable. I highly recommend using Displayport!If you are having random interval Black Screen issues or minor Flickering issues, I will tell you it is likely:- Your GPU and/or the load it is taking- Dust (in ports--clean your rig!)- Bad cableAny severe issues (frequent black screens, major flickering issues, dead pixels): Contact ASUS.I would easily buy another if I needed to for a full price and even so ASUS offers fantastic warranty on this (even checked with them).AGAIN: Get this if you are a GAMER. This monitor should never get less than 5/5 because this monitor is seriously High-Quality.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beast of a Monitor,2013-12-03,"Pros:This Monitor provides everything you could need and in my opinion is just as good as an IPS monitor in terms of quality and colors. This bad boy provides an 80,000,000:1 color ration allowing for brilliant colors when compared to my one-year old Samsung. I decided to bite the bullet and dual screen two of these puppies and I couldn't have been happier. I've wall mounted them  one above the other and it works flawlessly. The 144hz isn't completely necessary unless you have a machine like mine (i7 3770k @ 4.9ghz, Radeon 7970 HD Sapphire Vapor-X, Asus Rampage IV Extreme-Z ROG... I can truly feel the 144hz cap for v-sync. Be weary, I originally attempted to hook this up to my old monitor and they must both be 144hz to utilize.","Cons:This Monitor at stock is extremely bright, so reducing the color is necessary. After tinkering with colors and modes. I found the Game Mode to be the best for me playing WoW (World of Warcraft) while raiding. This Monitor doesn't come with a DVI-DVI cable which means that buying an extra should be necessary when buying this monitor.","Other Thoughts:Overall, this monitor is worth the near $300, no matter what anyone says about an IPS Monitor. I love these guys, you should at least give this Monitor a thought if you are in the market for one.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Worth when on sale,2013-12-03,"Pros:-love the refresh rate, now i'm able to play LoL at over 100 FPS-all my videogames looks fantastic with this even with only my xfx 7870-1080p is nice","Cons:-just as everyone says the colors are a bit off when you first get it. Honestly I dont understand what the big deal is, just adjust the settings. Isnt that what you would normally do for any new peripheral?","Other Thoughts:Definitely worth buying. I bought this when it was on sale for $240 with free shipping. If you plan on gaming for the next 5 or more years then I suggest picking this up.Whats the point of buying really expensive GPU if you're  just gonna use an average monitor. Youre just limiting its capabilities. The 144 Hz is very nice, stop playing on 60 and upgrade!",0,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Smooth,2013-12-01,"Pros:I'll update this later, but right now I can say I don't think I can ever go back to a monitor that's running at 60hz...","Cons:Not really much of a con, but those on-screen overlays (crosshair and timers) are awful. I don't really use them, but I tried them once. They just look awful.If it fails on me in the future, I'll update this to let you all know.",Other Thoughts:Definitely worth the investment.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor,2013-12-01,"Pros:Great monitor for the price!  The 24 bit display shows great color depth with 16.7 Million colors and 144 Hz refresh rate is great as well.  If you use the wrong cable the monitor will let you know that you can get better quality with a different cable.  You are able to use light boost in 2-D mode to reduce tearing but at the cost of brightness (I have been very happy with the monitor without ""light boost"" enabled).  I didn't think I would get much use out of the base which allows the monitor to flip, turn side by side and also set height but I use this feature all of the time now and will never buy another monitor without it.  The monitor's speakers are not great but they are there if you need them for an office setting, if you are looking for good sound buy speakers.  I'm not 100% sure but I believe you will be able to upgrade the monitor with Nvidia's G-Sync hardware.  I will be buying 2 more shortly!",Cons:Short Dual Link DVI cable included.  Had to order a longer cable in order to reach my rig through my desk.  Add another $10 for this in most applications.  Didn't take away an egg because the monitor by it self is worth every penny even without the sound.,Other Thoughts:I believe this monitor was used in a Nvidia build with G-Sync pre-installed but as I said this is an unconfirmed rumor (I did see a picture of the monitor and it look exactly the same).,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,So pretty. Beautiful gaming monitor.,2013-12-01,"Pros:Wonderful monitor. I bought this because my old monitor was slowly going bad, and stopped working. I needed a monitor I could use for gaming.Let me tell you, if you're looking for a great monitor, to make games feel crisp, and clear, this is it. Playing games on this monitor almost felt like a completely new experience. It's just big enough to be able to have a resolution high enough to see things really far away, but not so big that you can't keep track of the entire monitor at the same time.No bleeding, no tracing, just amazing.","Cons:First, the cord out of the box, was too short to reach my monitor from the pc (which isn't far at all, think the cord might be about 6ft),  Had to buy a new one.Second, the color out of the box, as everyone has said, it's pretty terrible , but don't let that stop you from buying the monitor, the colors can be adjusted (though it takes a while because the button setup is a bit crazy), but after having it adjusted, it's just beautiful.Other than that, everything seems to be well worth what I paid.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,amazing,2013-11-30,Pros:great monitor.. although i am a bit biased as this is my first 120HZ monitor.. however the result is still the same. I immediately noticed a huge improvement over latency. i am currently doing some work with stereoscopic 3d so i needed a 120hz monitor and this sure did fit the bill. the bezel is also important to me and this one has every adjustment that one could ever make.,Cons:had to calibrate the display for about 15 minutes but thats not a big deal ... unless you pay 1000 bucks for a pro ips monitor that is to be expected..

It also has built in gaming crosshairs for games such as killing floor that have none its a whole different experience.,Cons:not one,Other Thoughts:If you are a gamer i highly recommend this monitor i actually changed from a 60 inch to play on this one because of its awesome just make sure you are on game mode lol.,0,0

Not a single dead or stuck pixel on this baby, which is unexpected considering the high specs on this monitor.

I typically use DP for my computer, and I can connect my PS3 through HDMI. The monitor has built-in speakers, too. Playing my PS3 would actually produce sound (haven't done it yet) as opposed to the PA248Q where I had to hook up a special adapter for my headphones if I wanted to play.Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. No dead pixels (yet, knock on wood) and the monitor was in pristine condition upon arrival. I can't fully judge this thing until I am playing BF4/Arma 3 at the highest settings, but I have no doubt it will exceed my expectations!","Cons:I don't know if it's just ASUS in general, or if I have been getting unlucky with my monitors, but: both the PA248Q AND this VG248QE have had very loose power connectors on the monitor itself. Maybe this is normal with LCD monitors, but when I plug the power cable in I expect to be able to swivel/pivot the monitor without losing power. When I swivel the monitor to plug another cable in, my monitor loses connection because of the power cable coming loose, and it frustrates me. It's not a HUGE inconvenience, but I feel like the power socket on the monitor should be built a little more sturdy if it's going to have swivel/pivot abilities...

In my opinion, even though the colors are impossible to get perfect, if this is your only monitor, you will get used to it and it won't bother you.Between the loose power adapter socket (I really don't know what to call that thing) and the iffy display settings, I would only sacrifice one egg from this monitor's rating.","Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor on sale and was told by a good friend that it's one of the best gaming monitors on the market at the moment.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Monitor for 1080p!,2013-11-25,"Pros:A 144hz 1080p gaming monitor- take next gen games to the next level!  Using the Lightboost hack (strobe backlighting), I eliminated all motion blur in games!  Coming from a 60hz 5ms monitor, I was completely blown away by the difference!","Cons:Like most reviews, I agree that the color/brightness must be calibrated out of box, but that's not worth taking an egg off.  The only other disappointment was with myself for not being able to afford 2 more of them!","Other Thoughts:I recently purchased a GTX770 4gb video card- and almost blew a gasket when I bogged down to 35fps the first time.  I started freaking out and trying all sorts of things- until I realized my old monitor was the bottleneck.  With v-sync on, the monitor couldn't even handle a steady 60fps and would bog down to 35fps to keep it all in sync.  When I took v-sync off, there was TERRIBLE screen tearing, but no lag.  I realized it was time for a new monitor, so I went for the crème de la crème- the Asus VG248QE.  INSTANTLY satisfied- I can keep v-sync off in all my games and I never bog down below 60fps and never see any screen tearing!  Most games average 80fps!  I've never seen anything so smooth!Delving further into this wonderful monitor's resources, I found the NVidia lightboost hack to make the backlights strobe- this eliminated virtually all motion blur!  Can't speak on what this will do to the longevity of the monitor, but its an amazing little trick and makes a major difference in fps first person shooters, and may actually improve your playing ability!I have to admit this is the best purchase I've made in recent memory (coupled with the video card).  Buy this, you won't be disappointed- unless in the next few months out of nowhere 2560x1440 becomes the new standard and a monitor with 144hz comes out in that resolution at this price point, then I'd be livid!My rig:ASUS VG248QE MonitorIntel I7 3770K@4.5ghzASUS Z77 Sabertooth MB8GB G.SKILL Ripjaws 2400mhz CAS10 DDR3Intel 520 Series 240GB SSDCorsair TX650 PSUEVGA GTX770 4GB FTW",1,0

First ASUS monitor and 144hz makes a big difference, i've never used anything higher than 60hz until now. I kind of stopped playing FPS games .. and went towards digital drawing and league of legends so I'm not using it to its full potential obviously.

I like a physical button.,Cons:Not PnP for calibration: you have to spend a bit of time calibrating and fiddling with settings to get the image to be stunning. The preset modes don't do it justice.,Other Thoughts:This is my first real monitor and I really love it. Previously I was using my TV as a monitor and it was okay - but it's not meant for up close use like a monitor is so the picture wasn't as sharp or vibrant as it could be.

I can confidently say that there is a definite difference between 60hz and 144hz (don't believe the people that say otherwise).

My older AOC monitor I bought for 20 bucks looks better.,0,3
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Uneven Monitor,2013-11-16,"Pros:Great contrast. ArmA 3's nights look fantastic, especially with tracer fire. No more loss of detail and poor shadow performance!Sharp image, and sharpness settings that match up nicely to where they should instead of forcing you to compromise.Adjustability is nearly perfect and for the most part one handed operable.Best LED indicator I've ever seen on any piece of electronics. It's bright on the device but doesn't illuminate hardly at all and not at all past about two inches. It doesn't bath your room in blue light, which is a great touch. Really smart design on that one.","Cons:Color, especially out of the box, are pretty lacking on my unit. This wouldn't be that bad if the monitor had better hardware adjustment, but I'm struggling to get the monitor looking right with the onboard adjustments. This weekend I'm going to put some time into it trying to get it to work without nVidia's color correction.The tint is impossible to get rid of and really distracting outside of media/games, especially on bright sites like Facebook.Contrast and Gamma and Brightness have been very challenging to get right.Splendid presets seem lacking. There's obvious ""all the features, none of the features"" choice that actually gives a good image. RGB is there, but I have yet to get any contrast or brightness out of that  mode.A monitor, even one at 144hz (I've yet to get this working as I'm waiting on a new cable), shouldn't take constant adjustments like this and shouldn't take this much time to calibrate. If Asus isn't going to calibrate them out of the factory they should send us calibration hardware. I think I may actually have to invest in a Spider to get the colors to a point where I'm content with this screen.And man, they really need to have more adjustment options and better adjustment options on the board with this thing because of how Windows handles color correction (ie it's useless in fullscreen games. ArmA looks awful run in Fullscreen but awesome when I use windowed mode to stretch it across part of my second screen, because it benefits from nVidia's driver level color corrections.","Other Thoughts:I knew I'd be giving up on color for thee high refresh rate so I don't want to be too hard on but until I fix my issues (lack of clarity on what will actually push 120/144hz from my card etc) I can't give this better than a mediocre. The setup effort is ridiculous for anyone who cares about color. I'd rather have contrast a little worse (because it's actually hard to reign in honestly in my experience so far) and have neutral colors. They don't need to be super vibrant (which they have been so far) or anything, I just want something neutral.But I know that games CAN look incredible on the screen with minimal tint issues and I just need to see if it's possible to do the adjustments on the hardware so I no longer need nvidia's stuff to make the OS look acceptable. I will update my review over time, but I urge caution on this screen. It was a great deal when I got it but you might be able to find a better option barring the sale I enjoyed on this item. We'll see.",1,1

Hopefully AMD will also support the tech.",Cons:It took some time to find information on how to get the color calibration right.,"Other Thoughts:Calibration procedure I used:Standard ModeBrightness: 18Contrast: 80Color temp: user mode:  R96 G94 B88Trace Free: 60And then I ran Spyder4 Pro calibration to create an ICC profile. Then I used PowerStrip (AMD/ATI only) to load the new ICC profile. Remove Spyder software from start-up. Modify  C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\PStrip.ini[Global Options]EnforceColor=1This locks the new colors in Windows and games.Everything improved million times better. I notice some color banding sometimes during dark moments in some videos, but I think it's the result of compression. If anybody has a better/improved way, please post.",7,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Loving It!,2013-11-25,Pros:Great screen! Perfect quality and just glad there wasn't any dead pixels. Love the adjustability of it.,Cons:NONE!,Other Thoughts:Asus doesn't disappoint.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Monitor for 1080p!,2013-11-25,"Pros:A 144hz 1080p gaming monitor- take next gen games to the next level!  Using the Lightboost hack (strobe backlighting), I eliminated all motion blur in games!  Coming from a 60hz 5ms monitor, I was completely blown away by the difference!","Cons:Like most reviews, I agree that the color/brightness must be calibrated out of box, but that's not worth taking an egg off.  The only other disappointment was with myself for not being able to afford 2 more of them!","Other Thoughts:I recently purchased a GTX770 4gb video card- and almost blew a gasket when I bogged down to 35fps the first time.  I started freaking out and trying all sorts of things- until I realized my old monitor was the bottleneck.  With v-sync on, the monitor couldn't even handle a steady 60fps and would bog down to 35fps to keep it all in sync.  When I took v-sync off, there was TERRIBLE screen tearing, but no lag.  I realized it was time for a new monitor, so I went for the crème de la crème- the Asus VG248QE.  INSTANTLY satisfied- I can keep v-sync off in all my games and I never bog down below 60fps and never see any screen tearing!  Most games average 80fps!  I've never seen anything so smooth!Delving further into this wonderful monitor's resources, I found the NVidia lightboost hack to make the backlights strobe- this eliminated virtually all motion blur!  Can't speak on what this will do to the longevity of the monitor, but its an amazing little trick and makes a major difference in fps first person shooters, and may actually improve your playing ability!I have to admit this is the best purchase I've made in recent memory (coupled with the video card).  Buy this, you won't be disappointed- unless in the next few months out of nowhere 2560x1440 becomes the new standard and a monitor with 144hz comes out in that resolution at this price point, then I'd be livid!My rig:ASUS VG248QE MonitorIntel I7 3770K@4.5ghzASUS Z77 Sabertooth MB8GB G.SKILL Ripjaws 2400mhz CAS10 DDR3Intel 520 Series 240GB SSDCorsair TX650 PSUEVGA GTX770 4GB FTW",1,0

First ASUS monitor and 144hz makes a big difference, i've never used anything higher than 60hz until now. I kind of stopped playing FPS games .. and went towards digital drawing and league of legends so I'm not using it to its full potential obviously. Played black ops 2 and other shooters, its awesome.  haven't tried the 3d yet so no comments on that, all i know its NVIDIA 3d.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2013-11-22,Pros:Versatile stand - easy to assemble & adjust. I could easily have it horizontal or vertical. Plus I can move it 90 degrees on each side to view from another side of the desk (or show to a friend).Native resolution is 1920 x 1080.144Hz refresh rate with the dual link provided cable.Push buttons instead of touch sensitive ones. I like a physical button.,Cons:Not PnP for calibration: you have to spend a bit of time calibrating and fiddling with settings to get the image to be stunning. The preset modes don't do it justice.,Other Thoughts:This is my first real monitor and I really love it. Previously I was using my TV as a monitor and it was okay - but it's not meant for up close use like a monitor is so the picture wasn't as sharp or vibrant as it could be. I can easily see myself getting another one of these so I can do a dual monitor setup.,0,1

IMPORTANT!: need to use dual link DVI cable to make it work (included in the box). Maybe next version will be HDMI 1.4 that will handle 120hz and more.,"Other Thoughts:I was willing to buy a 27 inch monitor first, but my budget didn't cut it. I am repalcing a 4 years old 24 inch LCD monitor and boy... major difference! Clean crisp image with a very good time response (i'm an occasionnal gamer). Very happy with this screen.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Simply Amazing,2013-11-21,Pros:I've use to be a competitive fps player but I didn't have the proper equipment. I never thought that getting a faster monitor could help me as much as other players say. Everything is so much smoother and easier. I love it.,"Cons:When you first change the refresh rate to 144hz, the monitor brightness and contrast are too high, you will have to manually lower it in the monitor settings.","Other Thoughts:I was going to get it when it was on sale but it sold out as soon as I added it to cart, was very angry. Ended up buying the monitor when it wasn't on sale because I really wanted it. Still worth the money.",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazingly Good,2013-11-17,"Pros:Very smooth gameplayCrisp, clear images",Cons:The monitor and the mount are somewhat misaligned. (Very minor and does not affect performance at all).,"Other Thoughts:I've been using a laptop that has a monitor that's about 17"" @ 60hz for about 4 years. I can confidently say that there is a definite difference between 60hz and 144hz (don't believe the people that say otherwise). I recently discovered how to change the refresh rate for my desktop (outside of games) and my mouse slides over the screen like its sliding on butter, compared to the rougher 60hz display settings.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Worth every penny!,2013-11-17,"Pros:This monitor is amazing. Plug in and didn't have to change a single setting. Picture it top quality.

ASUS,VG278Q,3,quality for speed?,2013-11-17,Pros:Very low response times and no lag that I can notice. It does make a big difference in gaming espicially if you have a GPU that can play games at 1080p over 60fps. No tearing with this monitor.,"Cons:You basically have to choose between the quality of the image and t having the fastest LCD monitor out there. Overall if you browse, watch movies and look at pictures as well then you will see just how poor the image is.",Other Thoughts:Not what I expected after reading all the reviews. My older AOC monitor I bought for 20 bucks looks better.,0,3
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Uneven Monitor,2013-11-16,"Pros:Great contrast. ArmA 3's nights look fantastic, especially with tracer fire. No more loss of detail and poor shadow performance!Sharp image, and sharpness settings that match up nicely to where they should instead of forcing you to compromise.Adjustability is nearly perfect and for the most part one handed operable.Best LED indicator I've ever seen on any piece of electronics. It's bright on the device but doesn't illuminate hardly at all and not at all past about two inches. It doesn't bath your room in blue light, which is a great touch. Really smart design on that one.","Cons:Color, especially out of the box, are pretty lacking on my unit. This wouldn't be that bad if the monitor had better hardware adjustment, but I'm struggling to get the monitor looking right with the onboard adjustments. This weekend I'm going to put some time into it trying to get it to work without nVidia's color correction.The tint is impossible to get rid of and really distracting outside of media/games, especially on bright sites like Facebook.Contrast and Gamma and Brightness have been very challenging to get right.Splendid presets seem lacking. There's obvious ""all the features, none of the features"" choice that actually gives a good image. RGB is there, but I have yet to get any contrast or brightness out of that  mode.A monitor, even one at 144hz (I've yet to get this working as I'm waiting on a new cable), shouldn't take constant adjustments like this and shouldn't take this much time to calibrate. If Asus isn't going to calibrate them out of the factory they should send us calibration hardware. I think I may actually have to invest in a Spider to get the colors to a point where I'm content with this screen.And man, they really need to have more adjustment options and better adjustment options on the board with this thing because of how Windows handles color correction (ie it's useless in fullscreen games. ArmA looks awful run in Fullscreen but awesome when I use windowed mode to stretch it across part of my second screen, because it benefits from nVidia's driver level color corrections.","Other Thoughts:I knew I'd be giving up on color for thee high refresh rate so I don't want to be too hard on but until I fix my issues (lack of clarity on what will actually push 120/144hz from my card etc) I can't give this better than a mediocre. The setup effort is ridiculous for anyone who cares about color. I'd rather have contrast a little worse (because it's actually hard to reign in honestly in my experience so far) and have neutral colors. They don't need to be super vibrant (which they have been so far) or anything, I just want something neutral.But I know that games CAN look incredible on the screen with minimal tint issues and I just need to see if it's possible to do the adjustments on the hardware so I no longer need nvidia's stuff to make the OS look acceptable. I will update my review over time, but I urge caution on this screen. It was a great deal when I got it but you might be able to find a better option barring the sale I enjoyed on this item. We'll see.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Buy it,2013-11-16,"Pros:Incredible contrast. Bright, clear image. Surprisingly good grayscale accuracy and black levels.High refresh rates up to 144hz, and very low latency (response time). This makes a huge difference in games that run at high fps, but you can clearly see the difference just moving a cursor around the screen. More pictures per second = better 3d visualization of your position and orientation in virtual space in games. Makes a huge, non-subtle difference. I play FPS and my brother is into speedrunning (he's learning HL2 single segment right now), and we are both impressed with this monitor. My LG and rails in quake are better within a day or two, and he found it easier to do movement tricks and glitches in HL2.Great stand. monitor feels solid, doesn't shake around. height, swivel, tilt all work well and feel sturdy.dual-link dvi cable in the boxenjoyable for browsing, 1080p youtube videos never looked so good. Colors may not be highly accurate, but they look great for viewing content as an end user. Desktop feels really responsive at 100hz+","Cons:Some visual artifacts are noticeable in games when trace-free (the response-time enhancement feature) is turned all the way up (which it needs to be for response times to be minimized). A minor trade-off, but be aware that certain things will be displayed a little 'off.' This seems to show mostly when a black, non-anti-aliased edge is moving against a bright, saturated colored background. it looks like 'sharpness' or edge enhancement creating a slight 'halo' around the black edge, but I have sharpness turned off. I don't mind this in the least because the image is so perfect in every other respect, and ALL displays I have owned since the 90s have some little issue - but this is something to improve in future gaming monitors.at 144hz, I notice some slight loss of clarity and color weirdness, so I keep it at 120. The jump from 60 to 100hz is night and day. from 100 to 120 is noticeable and games start to look smooth in a unique and very immersive way. 144 looks only marginally smoother than 120 to me, and degrades overall image quality. Didn't affect the rating because the monitor is awesome at 120hz","Other Thoughts:I didn't try any '3d' features, used only in 2d mode.If the idea of a high-refresh, low-latency monitor for gaming sounds good, then get this - especially if it goes on sale again. It's the coolest display I've ever owned, and I feel overwhelmed with features and quality based on the sale price I got it for.  Great value at any price under three bills IMO.",4,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,ASUS VG248QE,2013-11-16,"Pros:This really is a fantastic monitor. It does what a monitor is meant to do and it does it well.-Very smooth, I could easily notice a difference between 60Hz and 144Hz-Colors are good once you take the time to fix them-The stand is great, being able to rotate, swivel and pivot the monitor really comes in handy.-Decent viewing angles",Cons:-Colors are way off out of the box. You will definitely need to take some time to fix them once you get this monitor.,"Other Thoughts:If you're not to concerned about color accuracy, this is pretty much a perfect monitor.

I have spent a lot of time trying to get the adjustments some what close but this is an issue with this monitor . Coming from a fairly new IPS monitor the colors are terrible.

Not a big deal.,"Other Thoughts:So far I have had no issues, no dead pixels, and it looks great when gaming! I picked one up at a great price through newegg.

ASUS,VG278Q,3,"Mostly good, but has ghosting problems",2013-11-12,"Pros:24"" is a good size for a 1920x1080 monitor. It's large enough to be easy to read, but not so large that the viewing angle becomes impossible to deal with.The image quality is adequate for for gaming, video playback, and text.The stand's adjustability is very good. It can tilt forward and backward farther than most monitors I've seen, which helps offset the narrow viewing angle.It can rotate 90 degrees, which can be useful for reading, and is really nice for getting at the cables underneath.","Cons:With stereo glasses, each eye can see a faint image for the other eye. How noticeable it is depends on the image, but a monitor that emphasizes response time shouldn't have this problem at all.The color balance is poor, but it's not so bad that you can't get used to it. It's OK for gaming, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything where accuracy is important.The vertical viewing angle is really narrow. It's not so bad for something like black text on a white background, but if you're looking at a dim scene in a game or movie and you don't have the stand angled just right, the top or bottom of the image will turn into an indistinct blob.","Other Thoughts:The 144Hz speed doesn't offer any benefit, it's just a bigger number on the packaging. Even if a game can run at more than 120 frames per second, the difference isn't noticeable.The fractions of that might be interesting (running at 72 FPS instead of 60 for instance), but in practice I can't tell the difference.The 144Hz refresh rate does *not* work with stereo glasses. If you're using stereo, then the monitor will only run at 120Hz.",2,3
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Perfect Gaming Monitor, Great Value",2013-11-12,"Pros:This monitor is exactly what I've been looking for.  I'm an avid gamer with a high end gaming PC and I upgraded to this bad boy from a 24"" Acer LCD.  The difference is night and day.  I've been playing a lot of Battlefield 4 lately and this monitor makes it look like I just bought a new graphics card.  I've had a huge reduction in screen taring and stuttering and particle and lighting effects are now much more pronounced and pretty.  It makes game play in general much more fluid and engaging.Video also looks great on this monitor.  I watched a few old DVDs that looked pretty muddy on my old screen but they look great on this one.  The 1 ms refresh rate and 144 hz simply make an amazing difference.  The monitor itself is also very sleek in appearance and the rotating base and easy height adjustment are a nice touch.Also, I'm not sure why so many reviewers are complaining about having to tamper excessively with the color options.  I got mine right in about 5 minutes, plus everyone's eyes are different and most people's settings wont end up being the same.  So don't let comments like that deter you from making this purchase.  I'd highly recommend this monitor to anyone who spends a fair amount of time at their computer.  You can't find anything else with these specs for a better price.",Cons:Not a single one,,2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,A game changer. Seriously!,2013-11-12,Pros:144Hz gaming. 1ms (GTG) Future compatibility with G-Sync. Easy to navigate menu. Bright display. Sharp text.,Cons:Not a glossy screen. Pixel pitch could be better. Huge 3D logo on the base stand.,"Other Thoughts:I have been using the Acer P241WAid for years and the monitor has been great! But I decided to upgrade to the latest in Monitor Tech. While researching on what to get, I came across a few articles asking how people can still be gaming on 60Hz monitors? While I personally do not enjoy watching TV past 60Hz, I wondered how this makes a difference in gaming @144Hz or even 120Hz. So I gave the VG248QE a shot to see what it was all about. This has to be, hands down, the best gaming experience I have ever had. I can't believe the difference and that I have been missing out! I can never go back to gaming on a 60Hz monitor. All my games and even windows is super smooth. Perfect example is when I loaded Max Payne 3 or BF3. The frames are displayed and ready to go. No tearing of any kind. Fluid motion. At this point, I'm not really sure if G-Sync would make this monitor better. It's that good, as-is. Also, don't let the 3D capable turn you away. I'm never going to use the monitor for 3D capabilities. So if your serious about gaming or want to have the smooth gaming experience, don't hold yourself back and pick up one of these monitors.",1,1

Even if you are getting over 60fps it is still enjoyable because you can experience over 60hz. The colors aren't as bad as people may describe them. Make sure that you have a dual link DVI port on your graphics card and plug the DVI cord into that one when you receive the monitor, if not you can't experience over 60hz.",0,0

But this can be adjusted with a bit if tuning.-The lightboost is a very cool feature. But it no activated with the monitor. This is more of a hack. When you advertise something I expect it to be there. I should not have to do hacks to access certain features.,Other Thoughts:Overall I am very satisfied with this monitor. Coming from a 60 Hz monitor to 144 Hz is like night and day if you play FPS games. It took me about a week to get use to the monitor but once I did my K/D and general stats skyrocketed in BF4.  Out of the box this monitor default setting is 60 Hz so you need to change that in your GPU control panel GUI to 120 or 144 respectively.,0,2

ASUS,VG278Q,3,,2013-10-31,Pros:Refresh Rate is great !! 3D Vision Ready .. Good Price .. Good for 3X monitor setup ..,Cons:BackLight bleeding !!!!!!!!! is realy bad and it seem to be getting worse .. Colors real off out of box ..,Other Thoughts:no dead pixels .. Has all the ports youll should need ..maybe Benq 144hz would have been a better choice ..badly wana give 5 eggs but backlight bleeding is driving me nuts....,1,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent!,2013-10-30,Pros:This monitor is absolutely beast! The 1ms response time and 144hz refresh rate gives you way better performance. Now I'm not missing too many kills in BF3. And also don't forget to put 144hz refresh rate from Nvidia control panel because when you first plug the monitor it will be at the 60hz.,"Cons:There only problem I had, was 144hz refresh rate only works with dual dvi cable, it will not work with HDMI cable.",Other Thoughts:So overall I'm very happy with this screen!,6,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Mine?,2013-10-30,Pros:I love these screens! They look awesome and are stylish enough for me. I use these on my clients desktops and they love them too.,Cons:Not making enough money to buy one for myself.,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent,2013-10-30,"Pros:Probably my favorite monitor I've ever owned. Great build quality, amazing picture quality, and super fast response times and refresh rates; couldn't ask for more.",Cons:None so far,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Unbelievable Picture Quality,2013-10-30,"Pros:Was playing BF on an ASUS 27"" monitor that imo was pretty decent, then moved forward with this one.  Now with BF4, the difference is stunning to say the least, and can only be attributed to the upgrade in monitors (since my rig has remained the same).  I've since gone back and bought two more of these monitors while prices are still relatively low (before the addition of G-Sync).Crosshair V mobo16g Corsair Dominator2 - 240g SSD's in Raid 083502-7970's in CFWin7-64","Cons:At first I was upset that it took sooo much tweaking to get the picture right, but in the end I've come to appreciate the opportunity to tweak each monitor to different computers and video cards (I'm not running eyefinity; got a server to my left, my gaming rig in the middle, and a back up rig for Battlelog's map to my right).  I use Synergy to operate all three systems from a single keyboard/mouse.  My settings on all three monitors average:Theater ModeBrightness 70-74Contrast 80Saturation 55-62User Mode 95/95/95","Other Thoughts:Currently running BF4 @ 120Hz refresh on high settings and the picture is absolutely breathtaking.  When better cooling is available on the 290x cards, I'd like to see what two of those would offer in CF, but for now...  Very happy with these monitors.",4,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,good for gaming... that's about it.,2013-10-29,Pros:beautiful for games.  super fast and noticeable response time.,"Cons:the default color setting is absolutely horrible.. very bright, colors are all out of whack.. contrast out of whack... just not right. took me a full day to set it to somewhat tolerable.","Other Thoughts:if your a gamer and not to much into anything else then this is the right monitor for you.  However, if you need to type reports, browse the web, research articles... then I would suggest investing into an IPS monitor.  This color scheme will bug your eyes out and drive you nuts.  Mostly likely will be returning this monitor.",0,5
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Monitor,2013-10-29,"Pros:Got 2 of these, Excellent monito!. Adjustable settings, I kept looking for a remote control when using this because it feels like a small TV",Cons:Extremely short power cable.I took a star off because this short cable is extremely aggravating. I have to mount a power strip to the back of my desk just to connect this.,"Other Thoughts:The timer and cross-hair feature are ok, havent really used it",3,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great,2013-10-29,"Pros:I ordered 2 of these lovely monitors. Setup was easy. The rotate at the bottom of the stand is perfect! The swivel and tilt of the monitor themselves is a very nice touch.I use these for gaming, mostly FPS and it has improved my skill along with the enjoyment of colors. I can actually see the difference in colors!","Cons:Only bad thing is they come waaaaaaaaaay too bright. I haven't found a perfect configuration yet, however there are is plenty of info on the web on changing the settings so they aren't so bright.","Other Thoughts:Changing the settings doesn't take very long and I wouldn't let that be a negative influence on these mintors, overall they are amazing!",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing Monitor,2013-10-29,Pros:Perfect Monitor. I have no lag in games and all my games are clear as day. Played Outlast on this monitor and I can say it was freaking scary.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I would recommend it to anyone who asks.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,FAIL 3 of 3 Units Bad,2013-10-27,"Pros:I have 3 of these monitors and let me say they are very nice monitors, when they work. They are very fast and have awesome stands and lots of inputs.",Cons:I have already replaced 1 of these for a bad display port. I just got home from a week away and the other 2 display ports stopped working. Also my roommate has one and his HDMI port stopped working on his. So when they work they are wonderful but apparently have a weak input controller.,Other Thoughts:RMA process was slow and cumbersome. lengthy form and slow response from the RMA Team. also they haven't provided me with return shipping yet for the one I have had replaced. (It states in the warranty card I received from them that this product includes free 2 way ground shipping.) I even emailed them regarding this. I have had great luck with ASUS in the past but this is just an epic fail.,1,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,AWESOME,2013-10-26,Pros:Great respond time! Great refresh rate! Great pivot and tilt features!,Cons:None that I have found I am greatly pleased!,"Other Thoughts:got one from my friend because he needed money, so then i was like i might as well buy two more and have an awesome tri-monitor setup!",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent monitor  for the price,2013-10-25,Pros:I like to finally have a screen with a refresh rate higher than 60 fps. There is a noticeable difference between this screen and my previous cheaper models. Movement is much smoother across the screen.,"Cons:A warning: The dual link DVI cable that comes with this monitor is rather short. Only about 4 ft. I had to get a longer one to properly route the cable around my desk. HDMI cables will not be able to do the 144 Hz refresh rate, so I don't recommend that. Either dual link DVI or DisplayPort is fine.",,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Great Monitor!,2013-10-25,Pros:Huge improvement from 60hz to 144hz.Great quality,"Cons:3D emblem on bottom of stand, not that big of a deal**When using the built in speakers with this monitor I get an annoying buzzing noise** If this was fixed it would be a 5 egg monitor.",,0,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Greatness!,2013-10-24,"Pros:I'm currently running this monitor with an i-7 3770k @ 4.5ghz and GTX 780 SC and it looks absolutely amazing compared to my old 60Hz monitor! Especially in FPS games, where you are clearly going to see an advantage in picking up targets on the move. The monitor stand itself is also very easily adjustable, making it easy to find the right angle and height for your setup.",Cons:Colors needed some adjustment out of the box. That's about it.,"Other Thoughts:If you're interested, look up G-Sync on the Nvidia website to see a cool new tech coming for this monitor. It will be the first monitor to support this new module which is designed to eliminate ""screen tearing, input lag, and even most eyestrain-inducing stutter"" in PC games.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Incredibly smooth and VERY bright.,2013-10-22,"Pros:First monitor I've owned over 75hz, and it's incredible.  Since I'm able to max out TF2 and still draw 200-300fps, it was naturally the first game I used to test the monitor.  Right off the bat, I could tell how incredibly smooth it was and my in-game performance actually increased as compared to my 75hz monitor.  Definitely not disappointed in the slightest.","Cons:Obviously, the biggest complaint I've seen about this monitor is that the colors come a little bit ""off"" from the factory.  With about 5 minutes of tweaking (I really only had to lower the brightness to about 50 and change a few other minor settings) I got it at a very nice color balance that I like a lot.",Other Thoughts:Don't let the comments about the color deter you from this monitor.  It's smoother than silk and the color issue can be fixed in very little time at all.,3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Dramatic difference in games,2013-10-22,Pros:* Practically no display lag* 144hz refresh rate!!* Very adjustable stand,Cons:* Poor view angles* Poor color quality until calibrated.  I have to use an application called DisplayProfile to re-load my custom color profile several times a day as it keeps getting reverted and Windows doesn't have a decent way to load the profile.* Only 1080p,"Other Thoughts:This is probably not worth buying unless you have a beefy gaming system capable of running your games higher than 60fps.  For low frame rate gaming and normal desktop use, you can do much better for less money with a good IPS display.This display is a big step down from my 2560x1440 IPS panels for non-gaming use.  But for gaming at 80 - 200 FPS, it is fantastic.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing monitor for gaming,2013-10-22,"Pros:144Hz, Lightboost, 3D, 1MS G2G response time, Very versatile stand, Built in reticule function.","Cons:Color quality, Dithering, Thickness, Viewing angles.","Other Thoughts:If you can get past the bad color quality and viewing angles (Not as bad as other 144hz monitors), you will love this monitor. It is like playing on an old CRT again with lightboost (which you can get to work on an AMD card if you google). I recommend downloading the ICP Color Profiles off various sites, they help a lot.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Worth!,2013-10-22,"Pros:Absolutely beautiful picture!  The preset picture settings will certainly work for some.  I had to do some tweaking on the brightness, but the picture comes through much more clear than any other screen I've ever used.  144Hz is built into the DVI port, so make sure you have a DVI port available (this shouldn't be a problem on any modern graphics card).  As for the framerate, the difference is night and day.  I went from 60 all the way to 144 in some low end games, and up to about 80 in some of the higher end titles.  Haven't tested the speakers since I prefer my headset, but I don't buy monitors for their speakers.",Cons:Didn't buy it sooner,,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Asus 24"" 144hz",2013-10-21,Pros:Great monitor for my Radeon HD 7990.also for my PS3 The games and movies look sharp!,Cons:None,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,AMAZING!!!!,2013-10-20,"Pros:This is a huge jump from the 5ms and 120hz that I've had in the past. Games run like never before and 80,000,000:1  resolution is the difference between night and day.",Cons:They don't put it in a NewEgg box so basically be home when its delivered or everyone going by will see this beautiful monitor setting there.,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Flickers rarely but picture is incredible,2013-10-17,Pros:This quality on the monitor is incredible. Everything looks so clear coming from a $100 AOC.No dead pixels.,"Cons:I haven't figured out the reason but I'm pretty sure it's the monitor. It happens rarely that when it does happens, I don't really care.",,0,5
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Great for gaming!,2013-10-16,"Pros:Excellent picture once you get the colors dialed in. Just do a search for this monitor + ""calibration"" or ""settings"" and you'll find some good starting points to getting more accurate colors. This is an AWESOME gaming monitor. Super fast refresh and response times and it is VERY noticeable coming from my old 60hz monitor. I didn't buy into people claiming to be better at first person shooters after getting this monitor, but I am a believer now! My KDR went up in every game I tried!","Cons:Yes, the colors are easy to dial in, but I have to give it -1 star for having to even spend time going through the menus to set it up right. With my last 2 monitors it was plug and play on pretty much default settings.","Other Thoughts:My settings (this may not apply to everyone, each monitor can be different):Standard ModeBrightness: 35 (always adjust to taste)Contrast: 80Color Temp: User Mode:Red: 90Blue: 90Green: 90Then add a SMALL amount of saturation (AMD) or digital vibrance (NVIDIA) in your graphics settings.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best gaming monitor barnone,2013-10-16,"Pros:144 hz1 ms24"" (perfect for gaming)I play counter strike very competitively.  I've upgrade my PC in the past, went from a wireless to a wired gaming mouse, done various things etc, but NOTHING comes close to the improvement of my in-game performance as purchasing this monitor.  Everything became instantly so smooth, making me even better than I already was. There's no way to accurately describe how amazing this monitor is, because you can only experience the full 144hz in person (can't watch videos on it or really see the difference).  Came from a 23.1"" asus 75 hz 2ms.  The difference is so incredible it's literally mind blowing.- - - - If you are in the market for a gaming monitor, purchase this.  I don't care how much extra money it is compared to whatever other monitor you're looking at. Spend the money, even if you have to eat ramen for a month to make ends meet, it is absolutely worth it.----This monitor is the pinnacle of human achievement.Don't buy into the BenQ hype. Benq makes inferior monitors that are more expensive.","Cons:Colors a little bright out of the box. Nothing to fuss about, took me less than 3 minutes overall to find out how to change the colors and get them to my liking.Little pricey if you're looking at the 27"" option.",,3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,best out there,2013-10-14,Pros:awesome picture. little to no lag. great input choices.,Cons:none. volume is lame but what do want for built in speakers. use the audio output for some externals or headphones.,,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Oh man... ASUS,2013-10-11,Pros:This monitor... Where to start.144 hz is amazing. I usually play CSS or CSGO so 144hz will make me alot better. The monitor is nice and big. The GamePlus features are really nice. The crosshair is on the monitor instead of in the game. Overall I would love to have a seccond one.,Cons:Timers are 30 min +,,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,This is the best monitor I have ever bought!,2013-10-11,"Pros:Very crisp and clear image, Very vibrant colors, Wide variety of outputs, Such a smooth image, Very very very responsive.","Cons:I feel as if the monitor should have came with a display port cable I feel as if a Dual Link DVI shouldn't be the only cable to come with, Other than that this monitor has no issues at all.",Other Thoughts:Even though this is a very expensive monitor It was worth every single cent! Thank you Asus for another great product.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2013-10-10,"Pros:After reading all the reviews on this about dead pixels and hours of trying to adjust the colors I was quite happy to find that it was very good out of the box, a little adjustment required here and there but aside from the preset features and quality is more than enough for the normal person and only technophiles will ache over exact color matching.","Cons:A little expensive, but what you're getting is worth the price.",,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best gaming monitor for the money,2013-10-10,"Pros:- 144hz allows me to finally utilize more than 60fps- Very high quality construction, sturdy base with swivel, tilt and height adjustments- Gameplus features, like the crosshair, are a bonus. Useful for things like hardcore modes in Call of Duty and Battlefield when no cross-hairs are available- 1ms and higher refresh rate noticeably improves twitch based gameplay over a 5ms 60hz screen. I will never go back- Speakers don't add bulk to the screen at all, nice and slim design","Cons:Not really cons, just things to be aware of- Very bright out of the box, need to lower brightness and contrast immediately- Dual link DVI is required to fully utilize the higher refresh rate, but a cable is provided (can't use HDMI)","Other Thoughts:After playing with this for two days straight, I can't believe I never made the switch to such a quality gaming monitor sooner. Even for games where I can't achieve 60+ FPS (looking at you, World of Warcraft), it helps smooth things out due to the lower response time as well as the higher refresh rate. For Black Ops II, it's smooth as silk at 120fps. I will never buy another monitor with anything less than 120hz",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor for Anything,2013-10-10,"Pros:The best monitor I have ever had. I had already bought one, but this week just bought two more. Well worth buying.",Cons:none,Other Thoughts:Great for graphic designers and gamers alike.,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,,2013-10-06,Pros:No dead or stuck pixels.Almost no back light bleed.Good stand.Fast refresh rate.,Cons:Bad/washed out colors out of the box.Power and DVI cables are short. More so the DVI cable.Could do without the giant white 3D logo on the base.,"Other Thoughts:Fast refresh rate makes quite a noticeable difference in games. Even 100Hz is an improvement over 60Hz.Don't expect to see massive changes if your computer can't keep up with the monitor though. Higher refresh rates only matter if you have a computer that can run games at a high rate of FPS. 120Hz or higher is almost pointless if your computer can only pump out 60 FPS.Colors definitely need some adjusting before being acceptable. A few adjustments and it's almost the same as my last TN monitor, although colors are still a bit washed out.Both power and DVI cables could be at least 6-12 inches longer. If you do any sort of cable routing you'll probably come up short. I had to order a longer DVI cable because the one that's included with the monitor gives me only a half inch to spare and it's running along the top of my desk instead of routed under it.Be careful when removing the protective plastic on the glossy surfaces of the monitor. It generates a lot of static. I touched a door knob while taking the removed plastic to the garbage and got a nice fat blue static spark. I would have been a little worried if that had discharged on the monitor instead of the door knob.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome gaming monitor,2013-10-05,Pros:Great 144hz gaming monitor. Nice stand. #D is amazing. VERY BRIGHT. Games look completely different in a good way. PRICE,Cons:Needs a lot of adjusting out of the box. It is really bright and colors blend in. But it needs to be bright for Nvidia's 3D if you run that.,"Other Thoughts:I wanted the BENQ monitor but they just released a newer version and costs almost twice as much as the ASUS. After about an hour of tweaking settings, it proved to be well worth the savings to go this way. Love it!",0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Exactly what I had hoped it would be.,2013-10-02,Pros:1) Menu options easy to use.2) Auto detected my HDMI.3) Pre-set's cover all of what I would want.4) No dead pixel's out of the box.5) Sound on monitor working fine.6) Everything looks absolutely amazing on it. Words do it no justice.,"Cons:1) Price is steep, but I'm happy with my purchase. So, give and take I suppose. I defiantly would have purchased two of these at a better price.","Other Thoughts:1) Do not purchase this monitor with the intent of using the built-in speakers. The sound quality is at best, acceptable. No egg deduction since the speakers actually preform -better- than I anticipated they would be! Should my current sound system give out on me, I wouldn't mind using the built-in speakers for a short duration at all.2) I used the 3 day delivery - due to a tooling accident at work I took the day off. The delivery person quickly tapped at my door and left my monitor, not wrapped or covered outside my door just... sitting there. Screaming to the world, ""ASUS LCD MONITOR VG248 - and here's a neat little handle to carry me away with.""Thankfully my wife who happens to manage the condos we live in caught the guy on camera and called me to check the door since when I checked the peak hole - no one was there. Additionally 'On-Trac' doesn't update your shipping tracking until the day it's supposed to be delivered. This could have ended in a massive headache. Bad form, On-Trac - bad form.",2,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great monitor, pretty expensive",2013-10-01,"Pros:* 144hz refresh - vsync no longer causes tearing* nVidia 3D works well, if your card can keep up* Build quality is great, and they back this up with a 3-year warranty, so keep the box.","Cons:* Expensive. For this cost, you could have an IPS panel, which may be a better fit for you* As with all LCD/LED monitors, view angles are limited. They are OK, but if you lean back in your chair, your image will start to black out.* 3D is not straightforward. Be aware that you MUST use the Dual-Link DVI or DisplayPort connections to get 3D working - HDMI does not support the required 120hz+ refresh rate. This monitor does not support 3D Blu-Ray movies from an HDMI source - you can play them back on a PC, if you are connected as mentioned above. If you want to connect a PS3 or 3D BD player, you need to get one of the monitors with a built-in emitter.3D game support is limited to a few dozen titles, and quality varies widely, but there are 3rd party apps that help add better support for many popular games.","Other Thoughts:There's one big thing to note about the 3D game capability - the monitor ONLY supports 1920x1080 resolution for 3D, and running with 3D on basically doubles the workload your graphics card has to do. As such, if your system can't do a very good framerate at 1080p (say, 60-80 fps minimum) then 3D will be choppy and probably unplayable. A high-end system is recommended (3rd/4th gen Core i5/i7, SLI GeForce 660 or higher) if you really want to use 3D.",2,0

Enough to the point that my K/D ratio in BF3 got better.Viewing angle is excellent in my opinion.  There is no perceivable loss in color quality when viewing from the front.Although color quality was not pleasing straight out of  the box, one of the other presets made it more than acceptable.Build quality appears solid, and the design is simple and straightforward.I did have the opportunity to compare this monitor against a competing $450 1ms monitor, and I'm much more pleased with this monitor in all 5 features previously mentioned.I would not hesitate to recommend this to the FPS gamer, as the smooth gameplay is excellent and the picture quality is more than acceptable.",2,0

If you want to have the best monitor on the market at the moment, this is the one.","Cons:The headphone jacks have some sort of weird ""ticking"" sound.

ASUS,VG278Q,3,Hurt my eyes,2013-09-27,Pros:Price.144hz gaming monitor looks great when gaming with enough graphics power to push 100+ FPS.Asus customer service has always been top notch for me. Same with Newegg. Those that complain about customer service must have bad attitudes from the get go. I have always been respectful and have always been pleased with the outcome.,Cons:I had tried the ASUS VG248QE 144HZ monitor and it absolutely killed my eyes. The reason is because of the PWM (Pulse-width Modulation) of this monitor.The default color and brightness profiles are horrible. No matter how you adjust the monitor it will only look good when gaming. There are some other ICC profiles you can try that do help. Asus recommends a profile from tftcentral but I found the Nvidia profile from pcmonitorinfo to be the best for me.,"Other Thoughts:Even with the updated ICC profile(s) the monitor was way too bright and the colors were never really good. Don't get me wrong, for gaming the monitor looks great. I tried several games and they all ran much better than the 60hz it replaced.I use my computer for other things and when I started feeling nauseous after 45 minutes of reading, I knew there was a problem so I started doing research. Google ""Pulse-width Modulation"" for a better understanding about this monitor.I'm giving the monitor three eggs because it worked out of the box and had no dead pixels. If you have sensitive eyes or want a multipurpose monitor I would suggest paying the extra money for the XL2420TE. The BenQ XL2420TE is currently the only flicker free 144hz monitor and is very easy on the eyes. It also has much better color and brightness.Sorry Asus, this one wasn't for me. However, I still have three different Asus monitors in my home that have all been very good.Thank you Newegg for returning this monitor and quickly sending me the BenQ. They may not verify me as an owner because I purchased an open box unit but this is the only place I can leave a review and thought it might be helpful to others.Happy Gaming ;)",3,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great, but had a defect",2013-09-27,"Pros:I mainly use my computer to work, surf the web, and game...Black ops 2, Battlefield 3, Arma 3, Planet-side 2, World of Tanks & World of War Planes.  Coming from a good Samsung 23in 60hz monitor, I was amazed at the difference when I connected the VG24QE.  Every game on this monitor seemed like a new experience.  That was until...(see cons).  Going back to the 60hz monitor after this one was punishing.  I will never use anything less than a 120hz monitor again.","Cons:After about 3 weeks of use, I noticed a thin straight horizontal gray/white line across my desktop about 3/4's of the way down (blue back ground).  It was more noticeable on solid color backgrounds than every day monitor images. (could not see most of the time in gaming).  I suggest current users look for this defect as I barely noticed it.  My main concern was that it would only get worse with time...so I RMA'd.Dual DVI cable and Power cable are short & does not allow much flexibility in positing your system.  The Dual DVI cable appears to be low quality.Additionally, this monitor was shipped in the original packing/box the monitor comes in from the manufacturer.  No additional protection was added during shipping.  Maybe this contributed to the defect???Color isn't great out the box.","Other Thoughts:All else aside, I was highly impressed with the clarity and response of the monitor.  I thought my 60hz monitor was great, but  I was wrong.  Unpacking this thing was like Christmas....it really is a nice monitor.  I highly recommend this monitor...but keep your eyes peeled just in case you get a lemon.I put three eggs to get the attention of the readers.  Hope the review helps.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,144hz is amazing!,2013-09-26,"Pros:Well, I received the ASUS VG248QE from Newegg today. All I can say where has this monitor been all of my life! The transition from 60 to 144hz is astounding. I played BF3 on this monitor today and it was like I was playing a different game. The gameplay was butter smooth, and I was dropping enemies like fly's. The picture quality is great, and the monitor is very well built.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I'm am very happy with my purchase, and believe that it was the right choice.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best gaming 24' monitor,2013-09-24,"Pros:Even though I've had it for only one day.. let's sum everything up. Coming from a Dell 60hz and 5ms monitor, you can really feel the incredible features this monitor has to offer.Pros:- 144 hz and 1ms tracing - no other monitor has that top-of-the-line feature set apparently. (If it does chances are it's much more expensive.)- 24 "" ideal for many people, including gamers.- Ultra smooth! That 144hz + 1ms combo will get you insane frags.- Crosshair and time functions- Large, but unique and good-looking stand gives ability to move monitor up and down or side to side with ease. (tilts, swivel, pivot and height adjustment)- Multiple preset video modes.- Stereo speakers as an added bonus (don't personally need them though, at least for now)- Vivid colors + full 1080p HD support- Lightboost option- Easy to installPerfect high quality monitor for fast-paced gaming.Do yourself a favor.. if you're looking for a gaming monitor, stop and purchase this one.",Cons:None so far,,3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome Monitor,2013-09-23,"Pros:I bought two of these monitors for the 144hz and 1 ms response time. I was able to get both of them for $158 each. The color is GREAT, awesome brightness... LOVE THESE MONITORS!!!",Cons:The cords are a little short at 3' each... I would have preferred a little more length. I also wish they had a way to lock the height so the monitor doesn't slip up  and down when barely pushed. (a pin to lock them at a certain point would have been nice) By no means would this stop me from buying another one at this price.,Other Thoughts:I plan to buy another very soon so I can triple monitor while gaming... I have two EVGA GTX 780's plan to buy one more of those as well.,3,0

ASUS,VG278Q,2,"Very good, when it worked",2013-09-21,Pros:Very good quality and colors. Easy to use. 144Hz is fun for games. If you are a gamer you should take it.,Cons:After 34 days (4 days too) the screen/monitor makes sounds like a sizzle when I run games. This sizzling problem is louder each day.I'm really disappointed to see that the material is so fragile. I now hope that Asus accept to change it.,,0,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Wonderful Monitor,2013-09-13,"Pros:No ghosting or blur, and I must have gotten a revision because honestly the colors were *perfect* straight out of the box.  Simply the most amazing display I have ever owned.","Cons:The base is cool.  I like it, but the rotation sort of lacks.  It does pivot nicely into portrait mode, but I have no desire for 3D so the huge 3D logo on the base sort of irritates me.  It's cool looking but just a shallow aesthetic gripe.","Other Thoughts:Oh yeah its 144hz and it makes games like BF3, Splinter Cell Conviction look like you were running unreal Tournament 1999 on an old 75hz CRT.  Seriously, 144hz makes a MIRACLE of a difference.",2,0

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Fantastic Gaming Monitor,2013-09-13,"Pros:- 144 hz- 24""- Stylish- Bright- Affordable",Cons:- Too bright- Requires lots of adjustment,"Other Thoughts:This a fantastic monitor that puts out a great image, but it takes quite a bit of adjustment to get it where it needs to be. First of all, this thing will burn out your retinas the first time you turn it on. Seriously, it's bright...Secondly, I had to do more research online on how to properly adjust this monitor to get the perfect image than any other monitor I've owned. Simply, the brightness and colors are just out of control out of the box.All things considered though, I'd highly recommend this monitor to any gamer looking for the best bang for their buck.",1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,ASUS VG248QE,2013-09-13,Pros:-Big-24 Inch-Bright-144hz-1ms-Sleek-Good Price for what you getThis is an amazing monitor for any use. Highly recommended for anyone. Im still using my GTX 480 SC and i am getting between 45-60FPS on Ultra settings in BF3.,"Cons:Unfortunately, i have one problem with this monitor. After a day or two of use, i noticed i had a dead pixel in the middle of the screen. After noticing it, its like its constantly staring at me. I see it every time i use my PC. So after spending about an hour talking to Asus customer service they told me i had to have a minimum of 5 dark dead pixels on the screen for them to replace it under warranty. So i called newegg customer service and they are now sending me a UPS label to get it replaced under warranty for a brand new monitor, for that it gets a full 5 stars. Thanks Newegg, you guys are awesome.","Other Thoughts:Seriously highly recommend this product to anyone out there looking for a good gaming or all purpose monitor, you wont regret it. Just after receiving it, make sure you do a full inspection of the monitor to see if you can find any dead pixels.",4,0

This one was almost blinding at first, but after a few minutes of calibration and tinkering it was just right.This is certainly a gaming monitor.  The speeds above 60hz are amazing for showing smooth action in not only games, but also movies and even basic UI actions.  This monitor even makes the minimization of a window seem cleaner, crisper.I certainly hope that if you are going to invest this much money into a monitor like this, that you have a sufficient graphics card to power it.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Wow is all I can say!,2013-09-11,"Pros:If you could rate this gift from the heavens 10 eggs I would.  No issues at all.  No stuck pixels, no problems with color bleeding, and no problems running it at 144hz.",Cons:N/A,"Other Thoughts:I moved down from an ACER 27 inch because my wife wanted a new monitor.  After offering her mine I was suddenly in the market for one of these.  Let me just say I definitely can tell a difference from using a 60hz monitor.  After setting the colors right in the monitors menu it simply looks wonderful.  The stand is fantastic.  It tilts great both up and down and it has a large amount of height adjustment.  I love the rich gloss black that its wrapped in.  After removing it from the stand on mounting it to my wall i feel a little sad that you cant see the beautiful black back.  The base swivel is awesome too.  The built-in speakers are sub-par (don't see why they engineered them in) but if your buying this monitor then I'm hoping you have a different sound solution.It did include a dual link DVI cable, a 3.5mm sound jack patch cable, and a VGA-to-DVI converter.  The power supply is integrated so there's no external power block.I've run this monitor maxing it out at 144 FPS seconds for hours and I've never noticed it getting warm at all.  I'm baffled by complaints that it runs hot.  Not mine.  The color and the brightness does need adjustment out of the box but that's about true with any monitor.  I found better color settings at a hardware enthusiast site rather than at ASUS's site.  (As a side note, the picture colors will be richer at 120hz but its not enough of a change for me to back it down from 144hz)This is an enthusiasts monitor and should be treated as one.  Make sure you have a graphics solution powerful enough to drive this monitor to its potential.  If your current setup doesn't consistently peg out your FPS at or above 60 then you need to upgrade your GPU card/cards at the same time.Don't forget to register this at ASUS's web site either.I'm saving up to purchase another.  I really don't miss a 27"" monitor, not when this one delivers such stellar performance.  I'll never use the 3D option but I would definitely buy again and I would definitely recommend a friend to buy.  BUY IT!!  You'll never go to 60hz again.(Oh as a side note, I sit in front of a computer monitor at my job all day, and most of my free time at night.  After I turned 30 I think I used to get migraines attributed to staring at a dang screen all the time.  After using this monitor on a daily basis with such a high Hz rate, my headaches are gone.....go figure)",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome,2013-09-11,Pros:-144hz is great-3D ready-lightboost able-built in speakers-stand adjusts to whatever position you see fit-menu has plenty of options-aesthetically pleasing,Cons:-stock icc profile's colors are not great*,"Other Thoughts:144hz is great but if you really want you're mind blown enable lightboost in 2D, crt quality from a lcd monitor!*while the stock icc profile could be better there are plenty you can download to get your monitor looking right thus no egg will be deducted",1,0

I can fully enjoy my gaming computer as there is no lag on the screen I can now see the difference from 60 fps to 150+ from my new gpu.",Cons:Color are hard to set up,Other Thoughts:bought it for the 144hz but ready for 3D gaming,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,144hz of Glory!,2013-09-08,"Pros:Everything about this thing is quality.  The difference between this and my old 60hz monitor is amazing!  The whole experience is so much more enjoyable and I would suggest any PC Gamer to take a good long look at this thing - it is that good.  I am 100% satisfied with this monitor and am glad I made the purchase.  I have only had it for a bit over a week, but each time I game I find myself captivated still by the enhanced gaming experience I am currently enjoying.","Cons:Well, actually it is more like 120hz of glory!  I am having some difficulty getting 144hz to work in games like BF3.  Granted, this may be do to my CPU (1100T) or GPU's (6990+6970) being capped.  I haven't been able to find too much out there about my AMD hardware supporting 144hz or not, but I am almost positive that I have read somewhere that AMD hardware such as mine is capped at 120hz.  Honestly though, this really is ok because this 144hz monitor costs less than the competitor at 120hz.  With all of this considered, this con really isn't a con.  Really, this monitor is superb, even at 120hz!","Other Thoughts:The stuff I listed under the ""Con"" section cannot and will not   be held against this monitor.  The monitor is fantastic and something any PC Gamer currently in the market for a a new monitor should take a look at.  I promise you will not be disappointed by this thing.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2013-09-05,Pros:Very well priced monitor for 144hz. Runs lightboost great. Very vivid colors and super bright (had to turn brightness down to 40.) Great stand on this monitor.,"Cons:Not really a con so much, as most monitors don't even have it, but the reticule (crosshairs) built into the monitor options suck, they should have kept them simple and small, like just a small circle.","Other Thoughts:If you don't have a 120hz monitor yet, get one. It's like you've upgraded your computer with how smooth gaming is on it or even just desktop use looks so much better. Like the good ol' CRT days.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor,2013-09-05,Pros:Loving the color on this monitor. The 144hz is amazing and it's pretty much night and day vs my old 60hz monitor.

Everything looks INCREDIBLY nice on it, and there's no glare (I have a window right behind me, and the sun likes to shine through it straight onto my monitor).","Cons:The buttons are on the under side of the monitor, but there are labels right above each button, so it really isn't a drawback at all.","Other Thoughts:If you're a PC gamer, get this.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Pretty Sweet,2013-09-05,"Pros:This is my upgrade to an ASUS VS Series VS238H-P monitor, the most notable difference is the 3D capabilities, and with a keen eye you can get a great experience of the 144 refresh rate. I did not expect the extra inch of screen to make much difference but it does. The stand is very sturdy compared to the wobbly VS238H, and when adjusting the height it is smooth and easily done.","Cons:The speakers are what you would expect monitor speakers to sound like, no volume remote control is a hassle. Switching from PC to Console I have to go through the menu and select volume to adjust.",Other Thoughts:Being able to remove the 'Splendid' sticker a plus.,0,0

I do miss the colors on it but for fps games I prefer to use 1920x1080.The colors are pretty bad compared to an IPS panel but hey I didn't really buy this monitor for the color.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Love these things,2013-09-03,Pros:EverythingNo dead pixels,"Cons:Not really a con but I bought 3 at the same time for my nVidia Surround for my 3 eVGA GTX Titans , 2 of the monitors have a warm tint color and the third monitor has a cooler tint , all are at factory default , not really noticeable still can do color correction.","Other Thoughts:I bought a forth so when I surround game I have a desktop above for whatever , I'm using a ERGOTRON 45-243-026 LX Wall Mount LCD Arm.I picked up my 3 monitors from a Newegg Warehouse in NJ than rather have it shipped to me messed up from UPS or FedEx.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Not perfect, but still amazing!",2013-09-02,"Pros:- A great alternative to higher priced ""gaming"" Monitors- Brightest TN panel you are going to find under $300- 1ms GTG, enough said.- 144hz resfresh rate is AMAZINGLY smooth.- Also handles other refresh rates very well.- Built in HUD reticule is actually useful at times.- 3 inputs - DVI-D, HDMI, and Display Port.- Supports 3D. Also: 2D Light Boost patches/tweaks!- Nice and sturdy while remaining easily adjustable.- The base is nice & heavy, and swivels/rotates easily.- Unless you are correcting a very old game, you will never need to use V-Sync with a game again. After 120 days of using this monitor, I have never seen a screen tear in graphics. seriously.","Cons:- It's too bright at times but you can always turn it down.- headphone jack isn't easily accessible.- The button labels are hard to see.- Standard viewing angle isn't perfect but is acceptable for a TN panel monitor of this size, and  can be overlooked as the monitor is so easily adjustable to compensate.- The viewing angle when using it vertically/portrait is just plain bad. you have to tilt the monitor slightly to the left when its vertical to get an even color across from left to right.","Other Thoughts:The title says it all. It doesn't have everything, but what monitor under $500 does? I can say this: when I first got it.. I wasn't convinced. Like others say, the 144hz does brighten and white wash in it's default state. But this can be solved easy with 5 minutes of using google to serach ""VG248QE color proifile"" and downloading/installing them (there are PLENTY of good ones to choose from for this monitor so depending how you look at it, I found this to be a blessing in disguise). As for the buttons, at first I found them annoying, being under the front and hard to see. However, it took a week to memorize them and their uses, even in the dark. Also not seeing them can be looked at as a positive too, kinda gives it a sleek look.When it comes to gaming, this monitor is without a doubt among the top choices for your rig. Yes, like most others say - the ""gaming"" mode is too bright and useless. But that doesn't matter, any of the other modes which are much better can be tweaked to you hear's content for that perfect picture for your eye. I use standard for desktop and web, etc, and I find ""scenery mode"" with the brightness set around 20 looks absolutely jaw-dropping matched with my Nvidia 660 series graphics card when playing games of any type.Every time a friend or relative has seen this monitor for the first time and I load a game up, I start the game in ""standard"" mode, and switch the monitor to scenery or theater mode, and EVERY time you hear ""wow... that looks amazing"" - or similar. It never gets old ;-)For me, the only reason I am taking one egg, is because I do like to use my widescreen monitors in vertical/portrait mode sometimes, and this monitor just doesn't have a suitable viewing angle in a vertical position.My final though is this: If you are looking for an impressive monitor for for gaming, you don't have to go to those other gaming specific brands/models and pay higher prices, this monitor does what it says. and it does it well. I have used it for 120+ days, I am typing on it right now, and I am quite satisfied I got the most bang for my buck out of this purchase.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,,2013-09-01,Pros:- High refresh rate makes everything look supersmooth at 120Hz- 2D Lightboost extremely easy to setup with my GTX 760 and had great results.- Design of the monitor itself is very clean and modern. Swivel/raise/rotate all work very perfectly.,"Cons:- As others have mentioned, the color gets a little tinted at higher refresh rates. I found an ICC profile for nvidia cards with this monitor and that noticeably improved things. White still looks somewhat dull but unless you're doing production video/image editing it shouldn't be important. It's not noticeable at all when gaming so if that's your thing don't let the color issue deter you.- 1 Dead Pixel, 1 Stuck Pixel. Arrived with 1 red pixel off to the side. After using it for a week a solid white pixel (for TN monitors that means it's dead, light is passing through unchanged) showed up on the other side. It's bothersome but I'll deal with it so long as more pixels don't follow. This is the only reason I deducted an egg.","Other Thoughts:I bought an Nvidia GTX 760 to power this monitor but now that I'm running 120Hz I've been forced to lower quality settings to obtain 120fps. I might add a second GTX 760 in SLI to bump back up to 120fps on higher quality settings. Basically keep in mind that with this monitor 60fps is no longer the saturation point for your graphics card, you need to obtain twice that to keep up with this monitor.",3,0

Well done again ASUS and Newegg.","Cons:Honestly, I don't work for these guys, but if you are careful with settings and placement of the screen in a cool room I don't think there will be any negatives with this one.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Gamer? No brainer. Buy it yesterday!,2013-08-25,"Pros:Gamer? No brainer. Buy it yesterday!This monitor at this price is a steal without equal. Course you need a solid system to pull the high frames but if you do -- you'll know what us oldschool CRT gamers knew all along about frame rates.Even if you don't have a beefy system, hitting 80+ fps is all you really need, but 60 lock really slows you down, and you'll experience it yourself once you have it in front of you.144hz on many resolutions. Can choose other options like 120hz as well which is more than enough for pro gamers.Color is fine, sharpness is amazing (due to hz more than anything) - use one of their ICC profiles or spend 20 bucks on a cheap hardware calibrator if you feel the need. Many people have normal TN panels already (and don't know it as these are the ones that are usually bundled or sold cheap) and won't notice any difference.","Cons:Takes a few minutes to 'warm up'. Always looks somewhat washed out and bright when you first turn it on, but then normalizes (and/or your eyes get used to it).",Other Thoughts:Best monitor out there for gamers. If you have a decent system you should plan to get this asap - it won't ever need 'upgraded' and you'll experience frame rate freedom you never knew made such a difference.,2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,StarCraft 2 at a glance,2013-08-25,"Pros:Lightboost 2D mode (the main reason I bought it).Lightboost 2D works with my Radeon HD 7850.In StarCraft 2, you get fast moving units and you have to skim your camera across the screen rather quickly in order to get a scope of what's going on. With this monitor, set up in Lightboost 2D, there is literally zero motion blur. You notice all frame stuttering, so it does take away quite a bit from the realism, but it dramatically improves accuracy if that's your goal.","Cons:The colors with Lightboost enabled are unable to be configured, and they definitely suck. The brightness is also lower with Lightboost turned on, even at 100% brightness level.None of these cons affect the product itself - LIghtboost 2D is a non-supported feature that you must use at your own discretion. I give this product 5 stars, because it does exactly what it's supposed to and I'm glad I made the purchase. I give Lightboost 2D on this monitor 3/5 stars, but likely compared to other monitors out there this is probably the best option for Lightboost 2D. I can't wait until this backlight strobing effect becomes more mainstream and becomes an actual supported feature - one which you can actually adjust colors with.","Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor on a different site, but they must have been selling it at a loss. If you can spare the extra money, go for NewEgg because their delivery service is just superior and I didn't like the delivery service from that other place.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great for Superior Gaming,2013-08-23,"Pros:Quality product, with the ability to game at up to 144 fps without any kind of screen tearing issues. Also has a very quick response time and there is almost no visible input lag with the monitor. Coming from a 60hz TV to this, my FPS gaming has surely improved and brought me to that next level of gaming.","Cons:When i purchased this it was @ around $300, and I saw it drop to about $260 a month later =[.",Other Thoughts:Great if you are an avid gamer and want to bring your skill level up another notch.,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Satisfied,2013-08-21,"Pros:- Very smooth at 144Hz, A whole new level of control, you really feel 'one' with the display.- Great Stand: Adjustability is very good, really like the swivel.- Very good build quality.","Cons:- Color Calibration:  This did bother me a bit.  It was very difficult to find/create a setting that I could tolerate.  I don't know if it is just my monitor but the white on the screen seems a bit purple.  I tried the ICC profiles from http://pcmonitors.info/reviews/asus-vg248qe but it really brought out the purple, so I ended up calibrating the monitor manually.- VERY bright when there is a lot of white on the screen.  It can strain my eyes a bit in a dark room.","Other Thoughts:Do your research on 144Hz connection requirements!Don't expect 144Hz if you are connected via HDMI.  Make sure your machine can connect via DisplayPort or Dual DVI if you want to run at 144Hz.I'm currently saving up to build my own rig and thought I'd purchase an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse for my laptop before building my desktop.  I went with this monitor and connected via DisplayPort to my laptop.  It runs 144Hz no problem, but my graphics card is the bottle neck until I build my desktop.Don't buy this monitor if you are planning to connect via HDMI.  HDMI does not support 144 Hz or even 120Hz for that matter.  Go buy a 60Hz monitor if your connecting via HDMI.side note: don't install the asus software that comes with the monitor, it's just crapware you don't need.  This monitor is plug and play.",7,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Fast Monitor,2013-08-19,Pros:The 3D is amazing!!! I was gaming on a 60hz acer for about 2 years and the transition to a 120+hz monitor blew me away.  Just simply moving open browser windows is soo much smoother. I can play video games like borderlands 2 at much higher frame rates with zero screen tearing.,"Cons:The price, but you do get what you pay for. Besides you can assume any monitor that's twice as good as 60hz is going to be twice as much money.","Other Thoughts:I found no information on this before I bought it, but the power LED in the front is BLUE. When it's in standby it is ORANGE ish. Not a big deal but it would have been nice to stick with the RED sceme considering I spent extra money  on my computer build to make it RED.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor,2013-08-18,"Pros:1) 24"" is the perfect gaming monitor size for me; no head turning to view screen corner.2) 144Hz is insane. I was pleasantly surprised how much it improved games from the standard 60Hz. (Must use DVI input for the frame-rate.)","Cons:Color takes some adjusting, but 5 minutes online going through some forums and you're set.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,"denied reviews, typical newegg",2013-08-18,Pros:None,"Cons:Had this monitor for over 3 months now, i wouldnt recomend it, the colors have dithering patterns which means that blacks look green and appear to have ""stripes"" around them, if my other review could be posted with the pic you would know whatr i mean, the other major con is the silly tilt of the monitor, whenever you use it you have to constantly adjust it to get it to look straight, i mean i spent hours just adjusting it.  the tilt should of had a molded plastic track with a lock on it instead it spring loads and always drips down uneven.  would have been great without all that to begin with, who buys a widescreen gaming monitor to use in landscape mode, asus just wasn't thinking with that one.","Other Thoughts:Would have given it a 4/5 if it didnt have tilt that always drips on one side causing it to look like a crooked picture frame, would have been nice to see a simple screw knob to lock it and a protractor to adjust it to exactly 0 degrees.  im very picky about these things, and if you buy this monitor, it will happen to you, i had 2 of these monitors and both were like this, but i returned the first one ebcuase of the dithering patterns.  Personally i would go with a dell ips monitor, i got it after this and its perfect, i can also buy a different stand that doesnt tilt for it and not have to worry about a slightly crooked monitor.",2,16
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"Great video, terrible audio",2013-08-16,"Pros:I've been using a 6-year-old HDTV as my computer monitor for some time now, and this monitor blows it away.  Very impressed.  Exactly what I was looking for in terms of a gaming monitor.  Incredibly smooth operation.  Heck, it's the first time I've used a monitor with a resolution greater than 1280 x 720....",Cons:The audio is awful.  One of the reasons I got this model was for the built-in speakers.  So disappointing on that front.  Guess it's time to invest in some speakers.,Other Thoughts:Colour and brightness are a little interesting straight out of the box.  Needed to download a profile to quickly get it where I wanted it.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great Monitor for Price,2013-08-16,"Pros:Excellent refresh rate at 144hz, very smooth height adjustment with  pivot option too. 24 inch is ideal size for gaming. Menu is pretty swift to go through. Must have for FPS fast gameplay!!",Cons:The colors are a little bit washed out feeling. I knew this going into buying this monitor from doing a ton of research.,Other Thoughts:For the amount of FPS games I play and researching as I always owned 60hz monitors the jump to the 144hz was really a night and day feel of how smooth the gameplay feels and looks. I purchased 3 of these to play at 5760x1080. I previously owned 3 Samsung 27 inch S27A350H monitors so I did downsize from 27 to 24 inch. As I do sit about 26 inches to where the screens are I can tell a big difference on easier gaming in surround as with the 27inch I did at times have to turn and look left to right I feel 24 is spot on as they are not to large and not to small.The colors of the monitor out of the box are definitely not the best but do some tweaking and for all you Nvidia users I think also setting your Digital Vibrance in NVCP to around 75 really will enhance and crisp the colors of this monitor to a massive color difference. But with any monitor everyone will have different opinions of how the colors look.For price this is hands down the best value packed with features monitor that you can get!!!,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing for fps gaming,2013-08-15,"Pros:After weeks of reading reviews and doing research on monitors specifically for gaming I decided to purchase this one. I just have to say it absolutely lives up to the hype!Switching to 144hz is instantly noticeable. Everything feels much smoother and much more accurate. It is a night and day difference. I came from a 19"" 60hz monitor I have been using for nearly a decade. I thought there would be some transition time adjusting to the new 24"" 144hz, I mean this thing is nearly twice the size of my old one! But nope! Literally within the first 5 games of Crysis 3 multiplayer I had some of my best games of my career. Tracking opponents and finding their heads was instantly easier. I was blown away.The crosshair feature on the screen is another absolutely game changing feature. It works VERY well! Almost too well! It seriously makes weapons with high spread and high recoil much easier to using hipfire. I dont particularly like it when I ADS though because I find it distracting. But from hipfire it is an instant boost in accuracy without a doubt!Suggestion to ASUS: an amazing addition to the on screen crosshair feature would be to be able to resize the crosshair! If I could just make it a little bit smaller it would be absolutely perfect! I dont think it would be difficult to make it adjustable either. The default size is a little big sometimes, but other times its fine. Just a thought!","Cons:The only negative thing I would have to say about it is the color.. but you should KNOW this going into it. Its a TN panel monitor designed for fast twitch gaming and its absolutely perfect for it. I personally dont mind the colors at all because Im just not picky about that, I prefer the performance boost. Every monitor will be different also so just find a profile that suits you and youll be good to go! Not even a big enough issue for me to remove an egg!",,1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent Monitor,2013-08-12,"Pros:-Screen is massive, at least in my opinion. Never owned a 24"" monitor before, it was either this or 27"" and I'm glad I got this one. 144hz and 1ms, and you'll notice it immediately once you boot up your system and start moving around windows and scrolling through your Internet browsers. You have to see it to experience it, it's absolutely amazing the difference between 60hz and 144hz. Colors are crisp and well defined. There's nothing more i could ask out of the monitor, it looks great! Highly recommended!","Cons:-None, except for the built in speakers, they're absolutely horrible so you'll have to get aftermarket ones, but that alone is not enough to affect my 5 egg rating.",,0,0

Just wow.I was having an old samsung 20"" 1600x900 60hz and this asus screen just blown my eyes away!I rarely write reviews, but I take time to share my experience with you guys that can't decide between some screens.The answer is simple. it starts with VG and ends with 248QE.I never saw this anywhere on the box or videos, but you have pre-set modes.Theater, Gamer, Scenary, etc. I always takes Theather Mode for gaming. Makes the sky, grass, ocean even beautifuller (what?).Some people don't care of HZ but I game since 4 years now, and I always had 60hz monitor. 144hz (or 120hz) DOES makes a difference in ANY game. Smoother, more precision, better view, etc!","Cons:Even at 35% Brigthness, it's still bright when browsing on white sites (newegg for exemple).And the speakers are very not loud. Just enough to watch movies without speakers or headphones.","Other Thoughts:No need to go with 27"" or higher then 1080p, your eyes won't even see the difference. This is just amazing for gaming, movies, creations etc.I currently have a GTX 560ti and it does not give 144FPS in all games (no way :P) but if you have a GTX 670 or higher, you will see what is 144hz.",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,mad,2013-08-09,Pros:I ordered this monitor on the 7th it shipped the 8th and im not getting it till the 12th are you kidding me.. I am furious right now. I got 2 day shipping and yess the 10th falls on a saturday but ups delivers on saturday and this is unacceptable. I am so mad that I am not getting my monitor within the time that I order it and this alway's seems to happen with new egg. I know everyone say''s there service is amazing but I alway's get craped on when I order from them that is all. monitor is amazing my cousin has one and there is nothing better for price out there.,Cons:what I said on the pro's its the same as this im so mad,,0,15
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Very impressed,2013-08-09,Pros:Design is very pleasingIndeed very fast response time144 hz - very heavy pro3D works well,"Cons:It's not for everyone, but it's not meant to be for everyone. If you need better then buy better. It's not designed to cover every possible use. I do the standard computer stuff, watch videos, and play games. It works perfectly for that.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is on fire. It's hot. It's got to be under priced. ASUS could still sell this monitor like hot cakes for $399 easy. It's well constructed. I don't use the speakers on it for the record so those may be the only real con to owning this monitor if you don't already have a sound system. My logitech center channel speaker sits firmly on the top of it and could easily be put at the bottom.It's very very bright out of the box, to the point that it was easily hurting my eyes. So you'll need to do some adjustments. As for the 144hz feature, using DisplayPort I found out that in my nvidia settings, I have two options. 1) HD SD - set it to 1080p 1920x1080 60 hz 2) PC (recommended) - set it to 1920x1080 144hz(defaults to 120 HZ for 3D).  I'm not sure what to make of that, but it looks like I can't use both 1080p and 144 Hz at the same time. *shrug*I've seen a lot of feedback about you can only get 144 hz with DVI. Well ASUS claims you can get it with DVI and DisplayPort so I went with DP, and it sure looks like I'm getting 144 hz to my eyes.Lastly, I'm using Nvidia GF 660 Ti atm. Everything's working nicely. No problems to report. No dead pixels. 3D vision works like a champ. I'm fairly new to shutter 3D but it sure looks more impressive than passive 3D. The only one complaining right now is my older monitor. Maybe I'll be nice and use it for something but I'm not much of a fan using multiple monitors.Thanks ASUS. I truly appreciate this monitor.",4,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome monitor for awesome price,2013-08-08,Pros:- Fantastic FPS and response time. Almost no tearing when playing without vsync.- Great resolution- Quite a low price for all the features,"Cons:- Multi-monitor setup took some googling, but worth it- Don't have 3D glasses so can't test 3d (though I personally wouldn't use it anyway)","Other Thoughts:When using multiple monitors, the 144Hz refresh rate works really bad (like its 20Hz), but it is easy to fix on Nvidia at least. Go to the Nvidia control panel -> Adjust desktop size and position -> Scaling and set ""Perform scaling on"" to GPU, and enjoy your refresh rate.Other than that little gotcha, it's a fantastic monitor. I haven't had any issues with the color, but maybe that's just me not being too picky. I highly recommend it, especially if you play a lot of games where you must turn off vsync in order to play well (such as Super Hexagon)",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2013-08-08,"Pros:Bright, having my old monitor as a second, you can really see how much brighter and vivid the ASUS is. Obviously the 144Hz is just amazing, blows my mind. I want to sleep, but I also want to play games on this amazing monitor! It's easy as pie to set up, literally plug and play (other than going into your GFX card settings and setting this monitor to 144Hz). Colors weren't messed up like everyone has been describing (unless I am blind to such things).",Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:Battlefield 3 on my current setup doesn't give me enough concurrent frames to fully experience this monitor, and ofc is my main game I play, but that has nothing to do with the monitor.

Not all the pre-set settings are good on this monitor. The best thing to do is look up some different profiles for it.",,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Highly Apparent Dithering Patterns,2013-08-08,"Pros:Good price, very low trailing and motion blur when ""trace free"" is set to 60-80, 100 overcompensates for the motion a bit too much, resulting in a dark afterimage.  Good input selection.","Cons:Very very poor dithering, which is to be expected from such an inexpensive 6-bit TN panel.  FRC/Temporal Dithering is noticeable on the majority of test colors, for which dithering is required.  Presents itself as an animated pattern across the affected area.  Google ""dithering pattern"" for a more detailed description / explanation.  Results in low color fidelity, and a distracting pattern in dithered areas when too close, or moving.  Narrow viewing angles compared to any IPS panel.","Other Thoughts:If the fidelity of the image is not important, this is an excellent monitor for gaming, providing good motion blur reduction in addition to a 120hz+ refresh rate at a very affordable price.  However, care should be taken for those who require color accuracy.  TN panels provide poor color, narrow viewing angles, and bad dithering compared to any IPS panel.",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,2,One Bug can Ruin everthing,2013-08-07,Pros:If the Refresh rate worked right. MANY MANY good things about this.

The monitor it replaced had pretty bad color to begin with, but even I was taken aback by just how bad it was. I was fully expecting this, luckily I had read many reviews and had a profile ready, but if you aren't prepared for it I can see how this would be a big issue.I also cannot get the monitor to go above 60 Hz. I have a fairly powerful graphics card,ATI Radeon HD 6900M, that  can play most games maxed out with very high, but I was planning on turning the graphics down a bit to run them at 120 FPS with this monitor. I cannot find anything anywhere online with anyone else having an issue, and I have tried everything that comes to mind. If it turns out my graphics card does not support 120 Hz, then I will be sorely disappointed, as nowhere could I find any information on what cards support this or not.","Other Thoughts:If anyone else has a similar issue with the refresh rate, please message me with a fix!All in all, I am giving this 3 stars for now. The monitor colour took tweaking to get correct, and lack of resources on which graphics cards are supported are a big problem; if it turns out my powerful graphics card doesn't support 120 hz, then this monitor went from being a fantastic deal to the exact opposite, an incredibly expensive, 1920x1080 60 hz monitor with terrible colour.when(if) I ever get 120 hz working, I will re-evaluate the monitor.",0,0

You can have some sup-a-fly computer, but unless you have the monitor to output the data...it's just another sup-a-fly computer and not one that's going to win you games.  You gotta get this monitor if you're a gamer or just hate looking at 60Hz all day.I expect this monitor to last me 10 more years before 144fps is a joke on some games >_< which is not expected anytime soon.If you're serious about your visual experience while computing, pick one of these up.

It's not too bad when comparing against white objects, but dark scenes look dark grayish-blue instead of black (my white balance is not off, I checked).The gamma curve is strange on the low side. What should be a smooth transition from grey to black instead looks like it stays constant for most of the darker grays (from about 25% to 10% there is no change) then rapidly drops down to the 0 (or as dark as it can get).","Other Thoughts:If you do any graphic design work or things that need color reproduction, RUN AWAY FROM THIS SCREEN.If you want 3D and like bright backlights, then consider this display.",0,1

My monitor stand on my computer desk is elevated 6 inches or so and sometimes the top of the screen is a little darker than the rest.

This monitor is great for gamers and responds faster than any display I've ever used.,"Cons:3D isn't exactly 1080p. In 3D mode, you'll notice vertical pixels that are longer than they should be. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but it definitely isn't 1080p. The checkerboard on my HDTV looks just as good, which it shouldn't. If you back a little more than 1 meter away it isn't noticable. At close viewing distance you will not get a 1080p 3D viewing experience. This was very disappointing, I bought this monitor primarily for 3D gaming.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Perfect for gaming,2013-07-09,"Pros:144 Hz and 1ms - makes a dramatic difference on gaming. The should be the main and probably only reason to buy this monitor.Brightness - Rediculously bright. Almost too bright, but I consider this to be pro because you can just turn it down.Stand - The stand seems well made, high quality. Adjusts easily. I love how much I can easily adjust the hight or swivel the monitor left or right.Price - can't get a better gaming monitor for the price. Best ""bang for your buck""","Cons:Color - I have to admit, the color is pretty terrible at 144 Hz. At 144 Hz there is too much gamma that cannot be adjusted. It makes the colors look a bit washed out. It's not something I really notice though in games for some reason.Comparing the color next to my SAMSUNG 2253BW 22"" 2ms(GTG) monitor and my wife's iMac (of course), there is a pretty noticeable difference.It seems there is no possible configuration at 144Hz that will allow you to get every color to match up right. If you try to add color saturation to offset the washed-out look, it doesn't look right either. Keep in mind though that I am exaggerating this a bit, it's really not that bad, but this is what you will notice if you have another great monitor to compare it to.","Other Thoughts:I almost gave 4 eggs for the washed out colors, but honestly I got this monitor for gaming and it does an incredible job at that.The incredible refresh rate and response time on a 24"" monitor far outweigh the color.If you are looking for a gaming monitor, it's definitely worth the buy.If you are looking for a monitor to do your graphic design or photo editing... don't bother with this one.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,More than 60hz on consoles.,2013-06-28,Pros:Amazing response times. Array of top of the line inputs.,"Cons:Colors are washed out of box. You need to play with them or use a color calibration unit to get them right. You can enable lightboost without a kit, just google it. The monitor only comes with an HDMI 1.4 port. Not 1.4a or 1.4b, so you will not receive over 60hz via HDMI input no matter what you do. Also the HDMI port does not have a built in 3D IR emitter so you will not get 3D gaming via console, through HDMI.. however you can via other ports.","Other Thoughts:This is a great, very responsive monitor with tons of adjustments to make it almost perfect. I say almost becayse no amount of settings are going to make surfing the web or photo editing look perfect. This is a gaming monitor a fact that the monitor does wonderful at. I have noticed a few people saying they can't game at 144hz or other things. YOU MUST USE A DVI-D ""Dual"" cable to achieve 144hz. Also, many people say they can't get over 60hz on HDMI. You won't. The HDMI port on this monitor is straight 1.4 at 60hz. Nothing you do will make the port input faster. However, for those who want to have a faster port for the new consoles you are not dead in the water. Just use the displayport 1.2 or the DVI-D port which both can handle 1080p at 120HZ. To do that you just need the proper adapter and be sure you have all 4 components. The input source, the cable, the cable adapter and the output source ALL have to be 1.4a or 1.4b, Just adapter your 1.4a or b cable to display port 1.2 or DVI-D. I just verified on my VG248QE. The VG248QE hdmi 1.4 port does not have a built-in 3D IR emitter, so 3D console gaming may not be possible on consoles. I was curious if my console would work fine via the diplayport 1.2 or Dual DVI. I attached a 1.4b hdmi to dvi-d adapter on my cable and attached it. I fired up my Xbox and went into information on the monitor. The monitor said it was at 1080p 71hz.. kind of﻿ a weird number but maybe that is all the 360 can chum out. Still on HDMI the system only came back with 1080p at 60hz.. so there was a speed increase by using a different port. Since I don't own a new console yet I cannot guarantee it will be faster BUT.. both console say they will support 4K. That means they will have to have HDMI 1.4b at least or they cannot produce 4K playback at 24fps. So I'm pretty sure they will ship with fast enough HDMI ports.",9,2

My other monitor is the BenQ XL2420T which is also beautiful in every aspect, it has a few more features that this one doesn't have but all in all they both have almost identical specs (where it counts at least). I went with this because of the 144hz refresh rate and because another BenQ was more than 100$ more than this one. I feel I got this at an amazing cost. When the time comes to buy a 3rd monitor for surround gaming it will be another ASUS because of the price and the quality is stunning. Don't get me wrong I love my benq equally as much, but they are so close in quality I just can't justify spending about 150$ more on another Benny.

It is perfect for Celestia, but it bothers. I spoke immediately to support, and reply it sawing that the exchange was not possible even a repair the front panel was impossible due to the warranty policy for dead Pixel. I advise those who are buying to test first the screen everyone 144Hz refresh at 60Hz, it is common to appear dead pixel on this model. In my case it is best to sell it in retail stores in 2nd hand, to get some money back. Be careful when buying this monitor, because the support from Asus exchange or arranges will not be possible.

ASUS,VG278Q,4,Pure Unadulterated Win,2013-06-17,Pros:When i first plugged in the monitor i could notice the difference between the 144hz and a 60hz monitor. I loved how fast the monitor was responding to games. I like the swivel base and the fact i can raise and lower the monitor with little to no effort. Easy to set up. The built in cable management helps if you want your work space to stay nice and tidy.,"Cons:When i first plugged in the monitor the colors were horrible and none of the presets were worth a lick. After finding a few monitor profiles online i tested them out until one worked well. The fact the monitor has some noticeable differences in brightness along the screen top left corner is the most noticeable from the rest of the monitor. Tilting the monitor takes a lot more force than raising and lowering. The speakers are not very amazing, i have to nearly turn the volume all the way up to hear them.","Other Thoughts:I wish they had added a lock to the height of the monitor, because sometimes when you tilt it the monitor will adjust its height. Removing the speakers might be a better price point for most people, as the speakers, are not very useful and production costs maybe lowered. Depending on your gpu card the 144hz  has a noticeable difference between 120hz when it comes to temperature, so i turn it down when not gaming, to save power and reduce heat.",3,0

Love everything about it.Note:  You MUST use the DVI-D cable that comes with the monitor to get 144Hz.  I fought for a while trying to use a standard DVI.  There is a big difference.","Cons:One and only one issue with this monitor:  No ability to adjust backlight.  If you are in a dark room this will burn out your retinas.  Turning down brightness only washes out the color.  My old monitor (Samsung) and every other TV and LCD/LED device I've used has a separate backlight brightness setting.  ASUS really dropped the ball with this one IMHO.I would be thrilled if a firmware update came out adding this to the control panel.  I looked for a setting via the nVidia controls and there is none.  I know it can be controlled because that's one of the 3d features, however it's not user accessible that I could location.This is my only gripe and disappointment with the monitor.  Unfortunately it's a big one.","Other Thoughts:Despite my gripe, it's a FANTASTIC monitor.  You'll love it.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,ASUS RMA might be bad but Newegg picked up the ball,2013-06-14,Pros:Great monitor,"Cons:Bad RMA policy, however when ASUS tried to send me a refurbished unit 34 days after I purchased the monitor Newegg intervened and corrected the problem. They are replacing my monitor with a new one like it should be. Too bad Newegg has to do ASUS' job.",,14,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing Monitor,2013-06-14,"Pros:Rich Color, amazing refresh rate, nice stand.",Cons:N/A,"Other Thoughts:Good monitor. Got it for the high refresh rate, and was delightfully surprised with the color hue. I thought my previous monitor had good quality, but I am very satistfied with the quality this monitor has.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Another Solid ASUS Product,2013-06-13,"Pros:***Forgive my gushing***Basically everything about this monitor is well thought out and well built. The up-and-down adjustment is done with a solid track design that feels very sturdy. The bottom of a base has a plate with wheels on it that allow the entire monitor to be rotated around 120 degrees with incredible ease. As mentioned in the features, full tilt, swivel, etc. Certain parts of the monitor are accentuated tastefully in red. It is slim and surprisingly light for the performance it packs. It's 3D and has a higher refresh rate than my system can usually perform in fps! 1ms response time. Solid and stable design. Great features with well rounded preset picture profiles (I keep it on ""standard"" but others have changed around the settings and found their own favorites). Matte screen finish. Several different video ports. Timer feature is great for time management, as I keep a rather busy schedule. 24"" inches is the perfect size for the small dorm room I have, but large enough to satisfy any taste. Energy Star certified. Sturdy and clicky buttons. Documentation is very nice and comes in about 12 different languages. Solid packaging from Asus.","Cons:I find the crosshair feature a little gimmicky but if you have a hard time seeing in-game crosshairs this should suit you very well. Also, you have to tilt the monitor out a little to shift it to portrait mode, then tilt it back to where you want it. But this shouldn't be much of a problem anyway.","Other Thoughts:Extremely well built, I'm sure this will last a long time. Stop wasting time looking through reviews and BUY THIS MONITOR",4,2
ASUS,VG278Q,2,update to previous,2013-06-13,Pros:Great picture,"Cons:Non existing 3d even with a 3d movie and gigabyte 7970oc card and powerdvd 13, makes it no better than a standard 120hz monitor.","Other Thoughts:So this has 144hz, does nothing for the 3d experience you are ripping people off when you say this.",0,14
ASUS,VG278Q,5,WOW!!,2013-06-12,"Pros:WOW this thing is sharp!! Ive been using a 60hrz monitor my whole PC time, and switching to this 144 is AMAZING! The quality is just unreal.",Cons:Can really think of anything.,"Other Thoughts:For the price, this is the best 144hrz monitor you can grab.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beautiful,2013-06-12,"Pros:Great for gaming as well as movies, depth is wonderful.","Cons:What glasses to use, they don't say.",Other Thoughts:Just show us on the product page what glasses will be best for this monitor.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2013-06-09,Pros:Movement on screen looks amazing @144Hz compared to a 60Hz really noticeable. Makes League of Legends insanely OP @ 1ms,Cons:DVI connection required for 144hz refresh so HDMI is OUT,Other Thoughts:So good I really like Asus products as always on the bleeding edge of tech design :),6,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Unnecessary for the majority of gamers.,2013-06-09,"Pros:-144hz, giving a completely different feeling to everything you do on your computer. (However this applies mostly to fast motion games such as FPS and racing)-Very functional stand.-Solid build quality.-Includes a dual link DVI cable.","Cons:-ColorsYou see it on almost every review in the cons section. They're painfully bad to look at. When I say colors, I mean my blues are neon, my pinks are crazy hot pink. There are a lot of saturation problems. No amount of adjustment can fix this enough unless you're going back down to 60hz. The ICC profiles are definitely workable for desktop use, but in games ICC profiles do not stick. I actually got out my old $100 Acer LCD that I had intended to discard for this monitor and plugged it back in.-PriceThis is just way too high of a price to even be considered an option in my opinion and is the main reason I drop it down to a 3/5 rating. If I could give it a 3.5/5, that would be a better number because price is irrelevant for people that should be looking at this monitor. If you are a professional FPS player then this is 100% for you, hands down; There is absolutely no comparison and the color compromise is definitely worth it. Non-professional FPS players will benefit to an extent and will enjoy the fluidity, however in my opinion it is still not worth such a bad picture.","Other Thoughts:This is a very specialized monitor. If you have not come from the times of CRT monitors, this is NOT something you should consider buying unless you are a hardcore FPS or racing gamer. This will yield absolutely NO real benefit to RPG, RTS, and other games that don't have fast first person action to it. If you are a professional FPS player then this is the monitor for you, no contest. The picture quality compromise is 100% worth it to you. Non-professional FPS players will benefit to an extent and will enjoy the fluidity, however in my opinion it is still not worth such a bad picture. I'm not an ""Accurate colors! Need IPS!"" fanatic, but I will say before purchasing this if you are looking for a pure upgrade, you can do much better.The only thing I have not tried with this monitor is using the 3D, as I was not interested in it for that to begin with.",5,4

ASUS,VG278Q,4,FAST Monitor!,2013-06-05,"Pros:Very fast and responsive to movements in FPS games.  Picture is also very sharp and makes longer range targets easier to aquire and track, works great for battlefield 3 for me.  24"" is a pretty big monitor but this will be relative to what you're used to, coming from a 21"" this thing is massive, glad I didnt get the 27""!Had to setup up the colors which were off quite a bit out of the box, not a huge deal, again something like this will be perceived differently by everyone and not all the monitors will be the same either.  No dead pixels on arrival, so far so good with it.","Cons:Supplied DVI-D cable is way too short, maybe a 5ft? cable at the most.  I ended up ordering a 10ft seperate.Doesnt have the most vibrant colors, but the speed and clarity make up for any of that.  After a week of using it I dont notice that issue anymore.  Adjust it to what you think is best and use it.Gave it 4 eggs due to the cable being too short, really disappointing to have a ""normal"" setup and have a cable be too short.",,2,2

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Excellent monitor,2013-05-31,"Pros:Very smooth gameplay when you get high framerates (>120 fps)Lightens blacks to make all areas of a map visible (good for games)24"" is a good size for desktop gamingMuch cheaper than benq version of 120 hz",Cons:user interface is annoyingcolors are washed out (this does not really bother me),"Other Thoughts:Have this side by side with a Dell U2312HM 23"" IPS monitor. I use the dell as my secondary screen for all tasks. Thought that the better colors of an ips would be great for movies, but turns out that 24"" over 23"" was more important.The Dell IPS screen was plenty fast for gaming, but this monitor is even better. The IPS monitor also had too dark of blacks to see all areas of maps. I could adjust it out with gamma but that made the desktop look terrible.tl:dr; Very nice gaming monitor, hard to imagine how the extra 100$ for benq would be worth it for same refresh rates. Superior to IPS for gaming applications due to refresh rate and lightened blacks. Have good IPS side-by-side and still use this for all apps.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,final review - sorry for the hate,2013-05-29,"Pros:GREAT MONITOR.  well made, 144hz.I have most games set to 100hz and 100fps cap.  they work perfect and smoothe with no motion blur.  Even on battlefield i dont notice the blur from the ingame blur.  I actually have the setting set to 0 so i can get free motion blur!  I dont mind that at all really like some people it adds realism.  You can always set the hz to 100 and it looks just as smoothe if it bothers you.Overall great monitor i was impatient and made a negative review and i take it back.  Nothing is wrong with the monitor it was just a bad DVI cord.",Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:buy this monitor, just go for it.here are the settings its set too for perfect color:scenory modebrite:90, contast 50, saturation 50, color at user mode and red 88, green 92, and blue 95with those settings it blows away RGB and standard mode and takes away all the ""filter"" to the oversaturated image.  I am loving this monitor now since i plugged in a display port connector and no more artifacts.",7,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Actually Smooth!,2013-05-28,"Pros:I could tell the difference in bf3 instantly.  Then I found out I had ultra still on which gives me 75-55fps with my gtx 670!  So I switched it to low and it was even Smoother!!  Today picking headshots (sniper) was noticeably easier, and to top it off I killed RivalxFactor, a pro gamer/youtuber, just at the end of the round   :DSome how it feels different, I think its because there is almost no motion blur and its 144Hz. Its really cool. Gaming with this is like a picture moving flawlessly... cant wait to try out my racing game, dirtThe screen is matte, which is nice so I will never have to look at the lighting or my face...  ;DAdjustable stand was nice(I still dont think its a must though), really sexy red stripe and it says ""144hz, 1080p, mad for 3d games an videos ect.""  all over the stand which makes it look like its awesome certified.If your an addict like me/wants to get thoughs drag and twitch shots then this monitor is for You!","Cons:the d-dvi cable is a little short (5ft), even my acer dvi cable is a Foot longer, and the power cable is also kinda short.  It didnt make me put my computer closer to my monitor though, but It kinda defeats the purpose of having the red cable holder at the bottom of the stand.I could buy a longer d-dvi cable if I wanted though.(being picky)glossy finish all around the bezel.  looks nice, but only for a moment.  I think it would be better if it was matte.","Other Thoughts:I saw the Acer 120Hz monitor on sale for $200!! just wanted this one, wanted to make a switch.  not that Acer is bad or anything.personaly I dont really care to much about colors.  Alot of people have been complaining about it, but the colors where ok out of the box, even after I changed the setting it looked almost the same.It was my first time really messing around with colors.  windows has a good quick program but I just went into Nvidia and changed the colors there.Gotta have some power to use this monitor, glad I got the gtx 670.  I still could use some more power, I would need sli to get med-high in bf3.Resolutions are getting higher so maybe they will make a TN 1440p 120Hz monitor...  I couldnt wait for this, plus you would need some high end power for a monitor like that....I still have my acer g235 23.6"" 60Hz 5ms.  wondering if I should sell it or use for video production/ 3d game design.  I  dont think  dual monitors look very good when gaming.",6,2
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Buy an ips panel,2013-05-24,Pros:.,"Cons:So this is my second monitor now.  Still the same issue im having.  IN a first person shooter if i stand in a shadow you will see the colors on my weapon look 8 bit.  I ended up using ""rgb"" mode which looks the best but unfortunatly i cant set any of the color or brightness levels, there greyed out.","Other Thoughts:Overall if you dont mind bad color, but enjoy a fast responsetime and motion blurring at 144hz, despite the box saying it REDUCES motion blue, it actually CAUSES it, theres something called ""lightboost"" which flickers the backlight to the refreshrate, it is also greyed out i cant select it, i have an nvidia gtx 660ti and the latest driver.  I dont know whats up with that but i like motion blur some people complained about it.Dont dislike this review,  i had 2 monitors of these models so far and both did the same thing, the issue doesnt happen on my other 2 monitors (ones an ips and ones a 19inch acer)  both have briliant color too.",5,14
ASUS,VG278Q,5,They say a human eye can percieve past 60 fps...,2013-05-22,Pros:Just got this monitor and right out of the box all I can say is how can anyone use 60hz monitors for anything? The display quality is really good I haven't finished tweaking them but man is everything so smooooooth,"Cons:The colors are not great out of the box, not bad, definitely not bad enough to dock an egg.","Other Thoughts:I was using a SyncMaster XL2370, which I love, the colors on it are still better in my opinion, but man does this smoothness out way anything. If you game or code or do anything besides photo editing this monitor is perfect. Highly recommended for gamers that don't want to spend $500 on Benq monitors.",5,3
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Best 120/144hz Monitor Out There!,2013-05-22,"Pros:Super fluid motion when gaming, great price, excellent response time, easily adjustable, great OSD, and colors look good for a TN panel once you do some tweaking.","Cons:1.The biggest con for me is that after a little more than a week I have a stuck pixel. I have tried fixing it, but had no luck. Hopefully, it will fix itself over time since nothing that I have tried has worked. While gaming it's hard to notice it, but it is very noticeable during general use. I have had ASUS monitors before (and so have some of my friends) and none of us have had this problem before. I really wouldn't worry about this if you are a new buyer.2. The colors on this monitor are really bad out of the box, but if you do some research on google/youtube you can easily find good ICC profiles along with proper settings for RGB, Brightness, Contrast, etc.",Other Thoughts:All in all it is a fantastic monitor. I would have easily given this monitor 5 eggs if it weren't for the stuck pixel. As a competitive gamer I can definitely tell you that if you can get enough fps to benefit from a 120/144hz monitor YOU WILL WANT THIS MONITOR.,5,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Stunning!,2013-05-22,"Pros:Arrived with no dead pixels, no stuck pixels, and no backlight bleed. Overall quality is excellent.",Cons:The included cable is only 5 feet long and wasn't long enough for my needs.,Other Thoughts:This is my third monitor from ASUS and they have all performed flawlessly. Initially there was some screen jitter when gaming or scrolling my browser page but it stopped after a few days. Maybe these high-performance monitors require some break-in period to 'loosen up' the pixels. Whatever! It's all good now!,1,0

Anyways the 144hz is miraculously fast for game play and movie scenes as well.","Cons:running on 144hz after a while gets the monitor a tad hot, not that big of a deal. Also going from 120hz to 144hz raises my graphics card heat from 29c to 39c IDLE which is a little crazy.","Other Thoughts:I can see in a few years this will be 1 of the go to monitors because of the speed and consistency the 144 gives, but also the graphics cards will be much better for these when that time comes giving you that much more of an advantage over those power saving players.",2,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,"Good, but not Great",2013-05-10,Pros:Great for gaming once the monitor is calibrated for 144hz. Lots of customization options between the monitors built in settings and using ICC files.  Even the desktop transitions and general movements are smooooth...,"Cons:The pros are exactly why this monitor has cons.  It takes a considerable amount of time to adjust the monitor to look great. I am using this with an Asus GTX 670 4GB. In fact, there are no clear instructions for what optimal settings for general use could be.  Part of the problem with this monitor is that general desktop use is fairly grainy, even after setting up the clear text through Windows.","Other Thoughts:I like the monitor, I just don't love it. There are simply too many settings that need to be changed, and too much time that needs to be spent getting it right... Even for general use.I'll still be buying 2 more for nVidia 3D surround, but I'm hoping for a 27-30 inch 1440 at 120 or 144hz someday that will require less tweaking and manipulation (at least give us some direction out side of GOOGLE for setup).",3,3

I spent about 10 minutes adjusting settings and was pretty satisfied, then adjusted a little bit more a couple days later and I am very happy with them.  It would be best to watch movies or TV shows on another monitor most likely since this type of LCD just doesn't do cinema very well.","Other Thoughts:If you are doing any sort of competitive gaming requiring fast accuracy, this monitor will definitely help.  I thought it was kind of a gimmick to charge more at first, but that is not really the case.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,"If you play fps games, get this monitor",2013-05-06,"Pros:-If you play any kind of first person shooter game and can keep a high framerate, and have cash to spend, do your eyes a favor and get this monitor. The 144hz refresh rate looks AWESOME. It gives you an advantage if you play competitively no doubt, it's easier to acquire targets and follow them when your eyes are seeing more frames in a second, AND without the screen tearing you get with high ingame fps on 60hz refresh rate monitors. So buttery smooth.-No/ VERY LITTLE screen tearing and virtually instant response time. Turning v-sync in-game on completely gets rid of the (barely noticeable) tearing, and I can't tell the difference in response times.-If you have a Nvidia card, you can do the lightboost hack.","Cons:I've never played on a high refresh rate monitor before (always been on 60hz) , so is it worth the 300 bucks? Maybe. If you game a lot, and consider yourself a fairly serious gamer, then yes It Is Worth It. It's so much better on your eyes, and just looking around in the game- it's like glass- smooth as glass.If you spent enough on hardware to keep a good framerate, get this monitor or any high refresh rate monitor, otherwise you're bottlenecking yourself by not seeing the 120/144 frames your system can push out.-MAKE SURE you are using either the dual-link DVI cable it comes with, or a DisplayPort cable to get up to 144hz. I have a AMD Firepro W7000 so it only has displayport outs, I had to go out and buy the DisplayPort cable because the monitor didn't come with one. I did have an adapter for DisplayPort to DVI, I'm not sure if it supported the dual-link DVI though, because it didn't work.-It's also reverted back to 60hz sometimes, and all of the other hz options disappeared. In the CatalystControlCenter it reported the max refreshrate to be 144hz, but there was no 144hz option. A couple of unplugging-plugging back in, computer reboots whatever fixed it, but it was kind of annoying.-The colors aren't the best, but it doesn't matter once you're in the game and looking around.","Other Thoughts:Ordered on 4/22 Monday, got it by 4/26 Friday with standard shipping from MEMPHIS, TN to California.",5,1

I also used the custom icc profile to make colors a bit better. Bought this to play quakelive and it rocks. Just get this monitor if your a gamer and you wont be disappointed.,1,2
ASUS,VG278Q,2,,2013-04-27,Pros:I love it when it's working.,Cons:I've been using for more than a month. And all of sudden the DisplayPort signal just lost. I tested the DP cable and the Graphic card DP port with another monitor and it's working fine. So I guess the DP on this monitor just somehow died :(.,Other Thoughts:Now I have to spent money to ship this and wait for weeks to get it fixed :(( so disappointed,3,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,buying another one,2013-04-25,"Pros:Yes, I'm going to buy another. After using this monitor, going back to other ones makes me feel like there's a layer of glue between my input and what I see on the screen.No backlight bleed or dead pixels. The stand is really great aside from the logos on it.Used the blurbusters hack. See other thoughts.","Cons:Buttons are in a horrible spot. Asus, please copy Dell. AG coating isn't the best, but it is nice not having reflections. Screen uniformity and colors aren't stellar. I don't like when companies put stickers on bezels because it's extra stuff I have to remove and clean. I wish the stand was plain black without 3d asus branding.","Other Thoughts:There is a way to eliminate blur on this monitor and the benq 120 hz panels. You must have an nvidia card.1. Install the inf file for the asus vg278 monitor that has a built in emitter. Your computer now thinks you have an emitter.2. Add a few lines to your registry to make your computer think it is operating in 3d all the time even when using 2d.3. Step 2 allows you to enable nvidia light boost at all times, even in 2d, so go enable it! (requires one of the 3dvision drivers which I normally never install)4. Set your refresh rate to either 100hz or 120hz. (does not work at 144)5. Set lightboost to 10% (basically as low as it will go)6. Enjoy blur free crt quality motion!Google blurbusters to find everything you need.",4,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Incredible.,2013-04-24,Pros:This monitor is probably my single favorite purchase I've made here.  I could not be happier with it.  Any negative reviews made by someone using this for anything other than gaming should be disregarded.  Playing games is a completely different experience than before.  It reminds me of booting my computer for the first time on an ssd.  Every time I open a new game I'm blown away at what I've been missing.  I generally only expect performance like this from items much more pricey.  I haven't even played Bioshock yet.,"Cons:The colors are noticeably less vibrant than my previous LG monitor, but I really only notice it while doing menial tasks that require no high end monitors.  I notice it while using web browsers or something like that.","Other Thoughts:I use this with a GTX680, Core i7 3770k, 8GB 2166 GHz Memory, 128GB SSD.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing Monitor for the Price,2013-04-23,"Pros:-Lightboost Lightboost Lightboost-144Hz-1ms Refresh Rate-Height, Pivot, Swivel, Tilt; Sturdy Base /Smooth Adjustment-Solid feel, solid buttons compared to other Asus Monitors",Cons:-Glossy Bezel = Fingerprints everywhere.  not a huge con.-Would trade the 2W x 2 Stereo Speaker for a 1 or 2 port USB2.0/3.0 hub.-Pivot needs alot of adjusting when viewing the monitor normally;  Isn't completely straight and tilts a little to the right,"Other Thoughts:I bought this as an upgrade/sidegrade from my Asus VE258Q.  Running these together side by side, they look like the same monitors with small variations (stand and screensize, 24"" vs 25"").  The button layout and OSD setup are the same but the VG248QE feels like it has stronger, sturdier plastic buttons, and they are very responsive.  As soon as I push the menu the OSD pops up with no delay, while the VE258Q takes at least 1-2 seconds.For the price this monitor is outstanding.  Asus could probably knock the price down even more if they left out the dinky speaker.  I tested it out by watching Bruce Lee's Big Boss on Netflix and it felt like I was listening to an old TV from the 80's with shoddy speakers.  Then I hooked up my Xbox via HDMI.  The sound was a little bit better but don't expect any lows or deep bass.  It does the job for people with no speaker system that only use headphones.Lightboost is amazing and the 144Hz refresh really makes a difference.  I'm actually running @ 120Hz since Black Ops 2 is the only game i've tested that I can max out and still hold 125FPS consistently.  I can honestly say that the decrease in motion blur as improved my game and my K:D.  I'm not saying this monitor will make you instantly better but it helps so much when making quick movements and ""flick shots"".",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Know what you're getting,2013-04-23,"Pros:Incredible responsiveness.  Games at 144hz, or even better, 120hz with the LightBoost hack, are absolutely amazing in terms of fluidity and precision.  High quality construction -- thing is solid and well put together, with good adjustment and positioning options.  (I've owned a Samsung SA700, and this ASUS monitor is clearly of higher quality.)  At $280-300, very much worth the cost.  Comparable BenQ monitor in the US is going to run you $100 more.  Get this ASUS instead -- same (in some respects better) quality and a lot cheaper here in the States.","Cons:Know the trade-off:  the price you pay for this very fast and responsive monitor is *bad* image quality.  If you're used to an IPS LCD monitor, be prepared to be very disappointed in how the image looks by comparison:  grainy texture, bad gamma, terrible coloration.  You can improve IQ with some research and effort (d/l a custom ICC profile is a good idea), but you can't really do it just using the OSD controls on the monitor.   It requires effort to get it to look good.","Other Thoughts:This is a specialized gaming monitor.  If you're looking for a more general use monitor and don't do a lot of fast-paced gaming (FPS especially), look elsewhere.  That said, if you are a serious gamer, and not only FPS, the trade-off of IQ for responsiveness at 144hz is worth it.  That's why despite the caveats, I'm giving this 5 Stars.  It's Excellent at the specific task it's intended for:  gaming.",5,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome monitors,2013-04-23,Pros:These monitors are a great size and look great.  They are not too expensive for what they are and they have ultra fast response time and refresh rate.  I bought 2 because I love dual monitors and they both perform great.  Easy to set up out of the box.  I might get 2 more just so I can have a ridiculous 4 monitor array.  I have them hooked to a GeForce GTX Titan.,Cons:Some people have complained about the colors if you are a videophile.  I use these for games mostly and I found using standard calibration guides make the colors look great.,Other Thoughts:Not sure what everyone is talking about the colors looking bad.  They look rich to me with some minor calibration (which you should do with any display you ever buy).  You can't expect anything to look great to everyone out of the box.  Part of the calibration process is getting it to look properly to your own eyes.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Incredible monitor,2013-04-23,"Pros:Lightboost, refresh rate without Lightboost, looks and contour, screen size / price ratio, ease of use. You need to decide what you are with this monitor. This is bar none the best gaming monitor around. When you enable the Lightboost override and tweak this, it's within a hair of a CRT in motion and response time. Take this from me, a true 90's gamer. So as a gaming monitor nothing better. As a workstation monitor, I find it just as nice. But you need to download an appropriate ICC color profile and install it. Once that is done and you tweak the contrast (50-65) and Lightboost (10%-50%) it looks really good for a TN imo. Of course for best workstation type stuff a true IPS would be best, but for overall combination of both gaming and workstation, this can't be beat. Make sure you enable the Lightboost people, it is MUCH MUCH better than even 144hz. The brightness in 2d will dim a bit when it's enabled, this is normal!","Cons:None except stock brightness and color calibration slightly off, alleviated through a simple ICC",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Fantastic Monitor,2013-04-22,"Pros:Fantastic monitor, colours look great once calibrated, stand quality is top notch. I don't think I could ever go back to 60hz again, games look amazing at 144fps.",Cons:none,,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,The best monitors to-date,2013-04-22,"Pros:Purchasing 2 of these monitors was a good choise. It is now making me conside a third monitor for nvidia surround. I love the response time on these monitors and refresh rate of course. The experience on the desktop and gaming is amazing. Everything  moves so smooth on the screen. I love the monitors overall options from the full swivel action, portrait mode and display options ( OSD Options, from timer, cross-hair, color options, etc... ). These monitors were worth every penny and are very affordable. I look forward to buying another in the furture. I highly recommend this monitor.","Cons:The only issue I have with the monitor is the fact that when you switch to 144hz mode the colors get washed out. I played with the settings a bit but there is still some faded coloration issues. I will figure it out, but it hasn't really hurt my opinion on these monitors.",,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Red Lines  when on 120hz +,2013-04-20,Pros:Everything,Cons:I get Ugly red pixelation all over the screen when ever i run it at 120hz or higher,Other Thoughts:Im not sure if its my video card or what but i get these ugly red flashing lines all over the screen when i run it at 120hz .. IF anyone at Asus can help me out id love it.. im running on a HD 6670 .. im guessing that might be the problem .. But id like to make sure cause if its the monitor i can return it before its too late.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,AWESOME!!!,2013-04-18,"Pros:For starters it was extremely easy to put together. It looks amazing, i had to tweak the settings just a little but besides that it looked and performed amazing right out of the box.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Shipping took 1 extra day but Im not gonna take away from the monitors rating for that. Worth the money for sure.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Absolutely Awesome,2013-04-15,"Pros:This is a great 24"" screen.Love the increased refresh rate from 60Hz.I have an Asus VE248H as well.  This one is brighter.  Much brighter.It has wonderful features and is easy to calibrate thanks to the excellent reviews of others.You can choose either 120Hz or 144Hz for maximum performance.There really is no screen tearing.Between 60Hz (2ms) and 120hz (1ms)(as I selected), you can really tell the difference with screen tearing.  This really isn't a problem for a huge majority of the time.  But occasionally it would happen.I recommend this monitor to anybody and everybody of fast paced games.Comes with the right cable.  Thanks Asus. They really do make great monitors.3D supported, but I haven't checked it out yet.I needed to 2 monitors for game development and the refresh rate to match the 2 x GPU performance to see exactly what I was getting for in game performance.  This monitor really does live up to the expectations I wanted from it.The speakers???  Never tested, and will never use.  Why even put them in, is my question.Nifty... Having the option to have on screen crosshairs from the monitor.  Very easy to do, and really pretty neat option, especially for COD, BF3.","Cons:It is bright.  Easy to configure.Doesn't come with 3D glasses.Kind of expensive compared to other 24"" monitors ($100 more than Asus VE248H, which is still a stellar screen).Not IPS, but they truly lake the refresh rate needed for fast paced scenes.","Other Thoughts:I was somewhat skeptical about buying a monitor with only a 1ms difference (The other 24"" Asus is a 2ms GTG and this one is a 1ms GTG), but am very happy and kind of shocked at what the refresh rate could really do.  Crysis 3, Bioshock infinite (FPS test) would occasionally have screen tearing, but this monitor changed that whole situation.  I run 2 x 7950 @ 1.1Ghz which runs basically everything at overkill except the Cryengine 3 (game production), so screen tears usually would only occur on a very rare chance,  going back to those situations now, they don't appear.I am very impressed by the results, and can't praise Asus, Newegg, and the valuable feedback from people like you that left a review enough for taking the time to give stellar reviews and feed back for all the PC equipment I have purchased.I was choosing between this and a Ben Q 120Hz monitor.  Very glad I made this purchase.",6,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2013-04-15,"Pros:Very crisp picture, excellent color.  The stand is also quite nice, with smooth height and tilt adjustment as well as a swivel base.",Cons:none,,3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Metza metz,2013-04-14,Pros:Good visuals with games.Good speed.,Cons:Grainy text. poor darks. White blooms noticible in dark rooms.,,2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Leaves much to be desired.,2013-04-14,"Pros:- 144hz refresh as opposed to 60 or 85 gives the perception of a slightly less input latency that is an issue with LCD screens when comparing screens of the same input latency but lower refresh rates.- Very low input latency.- The Nvidia Lightboost improves the motion blur issues, but doesn't eliminate it.- About as close you are going to get  to a CRT with Lightboost enabled at 120hz if the poor colors don't bother you.","Cons:- The colors, sharpness, contrast always seem off no matter how much you adjust it.  Green appears more lime green and yellows have orange tint to them even after balancing colors.  Text always appears to have an outline to it like you increased the sharpness too much in photoshop, but if you decrease it too much, it gets washed out.- Motion blur.  It is about the same as a 2ms panel.  The Lightboost only works with Nvidia graphics cards and when you use it, all the other options to calibrate the color are greyed out.  It will only work at 100 and 120hz, not 144hz.  If you only have a radeon card, you will not be able to use this feature.  I'm not sure how they measure 1ms, but motion blur should be non-existant if that spec was truly accurate.- Viewing angle.  It is very narrow and the shadows on the screen are different in your left and right eye.  I constantly was tilting it up and down to find that perfect spot.","Other Thoughts:Many of the complaints about this screen happen to be the colors and adjusting them.  This seems to be a tradeoff between the improved pixel latency, input latency the refresh rate of typical LCD screens.  While it can be made tolerable, the motion blur still leaves me wanting much better in games even at 144hz.  The test can be slowly moving your character's view while reading text, which is just about impossible unless you stop.  This is about typical of 2ms displays (in my opinion) as well.Many of the issues I had were amplified when I turned down the brightness from the stock setting which was extremely bright.I ended up using these settings:19% Brightness50% contrast100% red90% green84% blueThe lightboost feature only works with radeon cards, although a quick search shows that people are attempting to create a workaround for it to be used with radeon cards.  Also, you will need to find a workaround for using this feature in a 2D setting.  I don't see any practical reason for making usage of the strobing backlight so difficult or hackish to use.  Even when implemented, when comparing to a CRT, the CRT is still a magnitude better.Also, interpret my review as one of the most critical of current day screens.  I still have not found a screen that matches the quality found in CRT screens, (The closest being AMOLED which is only used on small handheld devices).  I am probably one of the last die-hard people using a CRT so if you're as discerning as me when it comes to screens and you think this is finally the replacement for the CRT, I advise you to wait a bit longer for technology to catch up to really be happy or you could just pick up an old CRT on craigslist for cheap.  If motion doesn't bother you, though, getting an IPS panel will yield much better colors.",8,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awsome for gaming!!,2013-04-13,"Pros:Fast, with no motion blur during games. Improved on my KDR and score per minute in BOII","Cons:Color, as said in almost all reviews. After playing with the color adjustments in nvidias control panel, I could not be more pleased!!","Other Thoughts:If you game, this is a must monitor!!",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Beast Monitor,2013-04-13,"Pros:This monitor is great. Upgraded from 2233rz and can see a major difference. Colors are not good out of the box, but it's a simple fix if you just browse online. Don't listen to the guys complaining. Get this monitor.","Cons:Colors out of the box, but simple fix.",,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,I love this display!,2013-04-12,Pros:This monitor is beautiful. Love the colors. Playing games on this monitor is a dream. This is my first 120hz monitor gaming experience and ill never go back. Im playing bioshock and cs go and these games look amazing.,Cons:I read a lot of reviews on this site about color correction and different profiles and what not. When i first plugged this monitor in with hdmi boy was i in for a shock. I have a gigabyte 7950 and I've never seen a worse picture on hdmi. I downloaded the driver from the disc which was a first time ever doing on a monitor. Did some research online and found out that hdmi doesn't play so well with these monitors with higher refresh rates. I immediately plugged in the dual link dvi and the colors were what i was expecting out of this monitor and more. I used the windows calibration using windows 7 and i couldn't be happier with the way it turned out.,Other Thoughts:Very very happy with this monitor and would recommend to anyone.,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,Step in the Right Direction,2013-04-11,Pros:It's a step in the right direction but is falling short for me. With 2D lightboost this monitor is awesome. I purchased it for gaming. The flexible stand is awesome. The 144hz is awesome.,"Cons:Here is the two big cons. The preset colors are terrible in my opinionn and the biggy, the fact that you need a high end graphics card to utilize it to the full potential. I agree with Oofloom's review below. There is a need to allow 2D lightboost for lower end refresh rates for users to utilize it's full potential.",Other Thoughts:I'm running a 3570 at 4.0 and a 660ti vid card and cant utilize 2d Lightboost to its full potential on the settings I would like in WOW. Can only run on High quality and some other settings dropped down. And I still drop below 100hz which I am ready is the lowest rate lightboost is noticeably affective.,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Agonizingly close to being the LCD hardcore gamers have dreamed about for years.,2013-04-10,"Pros:With the 2D Lightboost hack enabled it annihilates every non-Lightboost monitor when it comes to gaming. The difference in motion clarity is phenominal.... far superior even to 120hz monitors. The stand is the best I've ever seen. Monitor buttons and interface are much improved over older ASUS models. The size (24”) is great. My prior monitor, at 23”, never felt small. But the extra inch is really appreciated. And, purely aesthetically, it's a very cool looking monitor.","Cons:(The following paragraph refers to using the monitor with the 2D Lightboost hack enabled.)The fact that that 2D Lightboost is not an official, supported feature is a major problem. Currently the hack requires owning an Nvidia card. Most of the video control options are greyed out with Lighboost enabled. Overdrive is locked at such a high setting it produces artifacts. You are also limited to just two refresh rates (100hz or 120hz). Few  mention this, but if your game's framerate drops below the monitor refresh rate you will see a very distracting double image effect (this is not a defect - it's a fundamental characteristic of strobed displays.). Being forced to  match and exceed such high refresh rates means you will need a very fast graphics card, and even then you may still need to lower settings below what you're used to. Lower refresh rates (like 72/76/80/85hz) are badly needed.As for 3D, there is a big problem for people like me who prize low input lag: you cannot run games in 3D at 144hz. This means that you get the same amount of input lag in 3D as you would in 2D at 60hz with vsync enabled. Most won't be bothered by the input lag in 3D, and it's still relatively minor compared to other monitors, but some FPS players (especially those who still crave the instantaneous-ness of CRTs) will not find it acceptable.The contrast ratio (with reasonable settings) is unusually low: around 700:1. This may be due to the backlight bleeding, which is visible over almost half the screen when displaying a black image. The bleeding is worse, and the contrast ratio lower, than any other monitor I've used in the last few years. And all of those other monitors were much cheaper than this one. I hear the exact same comments from other owners, some of whom I know to be experts. Unacceptable.","Other Thoughts:I didn't keep my VG248QE. The backlight/contrast issue was a deal-breaker all by itself, but even if it hadn't been an issue I still probably wouldn't have kept the monitor. 2D Lighboost is amazing... but it is very problematic due to not being a properly implemented feature. I advise waiting until it is.",34,4
ASUS,VG278Q,4,SECOND REVIEW DENIED,2013-04-10,"Pros:I loved the monitor.. I run solid 120hz for games with unlimited frame options I enable the 144hz option for all my first person shooters. Even the main list of Games compatible found online are not right.. They don't have all the games, only 3D ""3D"". Or just your big list I posted in my last review.  Also Not going to re-post the links because it may be why it was withheld. It plays Unreal 2004, Quake 4, Halo, all the others as well again a lot are not listed. Runs great when proper configs. I finally got through all the fine comb picking through settings to get this thing to run emulators smoothly and seamlessly. Still working on a couple settings. I nearly have every game ever made! Pre-PS and Xbox 360 as do many. I literally have em all working on my hard drives.. No blur.. super fast. Man again when proper config. This thing is so bright and with perfection even the HP2311x and bigger versions and mac screens this one owns. GREAT SIZE And Modified stuff. They have good color but this one still is better. Awesome 3D.. I am running a GTX560 at its max.","Cons:LED is like any monitor. It is just the lead selling id. It is literally every monitor. Yes there are other kinds but when you have the option of lightboost hack. It is kinda rough trying to get the color profile extension. GOOD LUCK THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY> GOOGLE THAT #$%T. I think the worst part about it is trying to remember the organizational buttons on the bottom by the power button, if you are familiar with the other buttons on the older monitor it is much the same.. The only reason I had to give 4 stars is because I exchanged my 27'' monitor it was to big and lag. IT DID NOT COME WITH ANY GLASSES Not even the cheap paper ones you can buy somewhere cheap.. Those are considered and option in the 3D list of glasses also confusing.. Do not get your PS 3D  monitor and your CPU monitor confused because the 3D is defiantly a different touch.. AND do not go and purchase the black 3D glasses with the PS logo on it.","Other Thoughts:Hey all, I already made a Review and it was like non existent this is my second real review that seems to be not in the past reviews even though I already reviewed it. I guess I would take it up with newegg support too.  I am certain everything should have proceeded as normal, I didn't run into any problems during my last review process. It is like they are hiding the bad reviews they get for popular stuff, except they have the best deals ever.. Who wouldn't want to come and shop online at newegg.. lucky's. #%#$. I am tired of writing this review.. I started blue screening alot during Black Ops 2. But I think it was my skidrow.. GAME! HAHA HA",0,10
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Fantastic!,2013-04-09,Pros:Playing games looks great! Photos look better than ever. Movies look great. Everything you'd expect from a great monitor.,Cons:Calibrate it yourself. The presets suck and you need to fiddle w/ the settings yourself which may take a few hours considering you'll have 1-4 presets to set-up.,Other Thoughts:It took me 2 hours to figure out how to get the 1920x1080 resolution to go fullscreen w/o those black bars. Eventually I realized I could go to AMD catalyst control center and just set my scaling options so that overscan = 0%. lol overall I'd strongly reccommend this one if you're a gamer. BF3 never looked better,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,1,BACKLIGHT ISSUES!,2013-04-08,Pros:Can't enjoy this monitor from the backlight bleeding issue! I'm sure there are lots of pro's but hard to enjoy with current issue.,"Cons:Bought this over at another website, back light bleeds in the center! Strange Oval shaped back light bleeds through and very noticeable through a dark background. Hard to focus on games or movies with this back light glaring right at you. A bit disappointing for a ~$300 monitor. This is a similar issue with their VG278H Model that had the SAME issue. Google, ASUS backlight oval issue. Mine looks exactly like that. Anyone else having this issue?","Other Thoughts:I want to say this is a great monitor, I want to also enjoy the very fast 144hz 1ms. Noticed it first on Bioshock Infinite very first 10 minutes of the game, just a white oval/horizontal backlight screaming at my face. Currently put the game on hold until monitor issue is fixed, the game has great colors which I cannot enjoy atm because of backlight issue. This is WITH proper calibration!",2,7
ASUS,VG278Q,5,,2013-04-07,"Pros:Big, 1080p, 1 ms GTG response, completely adjustable, and of course 144 Hz refresh rate.  Smooth as butter in CS:GO and TF2.  I upgraded from a Samsung 60 Hz, and the difference is amazing.  I can never go back to a 60 Hz monitor.","Cons:Colors out of box are pretty bad, but after tweaking they are fine.  Not using this monitor for photo editing or anything, so it's not an issue for me.  I recommend raising digital vibrance to ~ 70% and using the ICC profile from PCmonitor.info","Other Thoughts:Worth every penny.  I tried using the 120 Hz + Lightboost tweak (google it if interested), but the difference was only noticeable with TFT ghosting-testing software (not noticeable in game).  Plus the lightboost strobing gave me eye strain, so I'm sticking with the 144 Hz.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Big and Beautiful,2013-04-05,"Pros:Large size, multiple movement options, 144hz really works. I can tell the color will be amazing.","Cons:Default color accuracy is horrible and looks washed out. back light is very bright. speakers are the worst but i didn't but the monitor for that reason. It may be a little too big for some, I know I'm still getting use to it. The preset options are a joke.","Other Thoughts:I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this monitor and so far I'm very pleased with it. The one thing I'm having trouble with is calibrating it properly, I'm unsure how to do this, but I'm positive this monitor will rock. I had to choose between a TN or an IPS and I went with this for the refresh rate, overall reviews and the fact I'm not a graphics professional; I'm a gamer.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Not just hype,2013-04-03,"Pros:This thing is amazing. Every game I've tested thus far looks stunningly smooth, and fluid, thanks to the almost non-existent response time, and high refresh rate. I wasn't expecting a huge difference over standard 60hz monitors, and I've never been so happy to be wrong. It really is something you must see to believe.The 3D is very nice, also.","Cons:- As stated in most other reviews, the color is lacking. Even after some tweaking, it is still subpar. In my case, however, it is a worthy tradeoff.- Price. While it is cheaper than others in it's class, the price is on par with many high-end color-accurate displays, and at least in my case, this made my decision that much tougher.- Unless I'm missing a setting somewhere, text looks pretty bad.",,1,1
ASUS,VG278Q,4,amazing monitor,2013-04-02,"Pros:Great  for gaming and watching movies.  If your looking for a monitor and gaming is your main use for your PC , its probably not going to get better then this monitor at the 24inch size.",Cons:Brightness is way way too high and even when you turn it down it still can wash out pictures.  Its an easy fix if you know your way around advanced settings in your nvidia control panel.  Novice users may have trouble figuring it out because the monitor lacks on screen options to adjust picture settings.,"Other Thoughts:I didn't think the refresh rate would really make a difference gaming, but I can tell you it is very noticeable when playing FPS.  I'm using (2) MSI GTX 580 Extreme lightening Editions in SLI and I have been able to play every new game at MAX settings and am still able to notice the difference playing at 120hz, nevermind even the 144hz setting.  Its just one of those things you have to use to really understand what I'm talking about.  You will not be dissapointed with this purchase.",0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,3,Worth knowing.,2013-04-01,"Pros:So, this is like a follow up.  As far as speed goes, this is the ticket.","Cons:Well, I had to return it.  All my kudos from my other review are still true, but after the initial shock and you actually spend some time with this monitor, for me, I have to confess it strained my eyes.  It's kind of like the strain you feel when you're watching a 3-d movie or something.  At first I had to contemplate whether a minor irritant like that was something I could overcome.  Trust me, my games looked never better and parting with this finally turned into a necessary concession.It's awesome, but after a couple of hours, reading and stuff is really tough.  I believe I now have a better picture of why these kinds of refresh rates wouldn't just be standard.  I just don't think they quite have the solution ready for prime time.",,9,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2013-04-01,Pros:Awesome monitor! Definitely the best monitor I've ever owned. Everything is very clear and clean! Makes my old 60hz monitor look horrific.,Cons:None!,"Other Thoughts:Asus, you never let me down. Awesome monitor once again!",3,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great monitor don't let the color settings scare you!!!,2013-03-27,Pros:This monitor is the sweet. 144hz 1ms is awesome for the gaming I do. After setting the colors and brightness it looks amazing and the menus are easy enough to get through. The stand is sturdy and probably my favorite part of it. Speakers work and I use them for Netflix and hulu when I'm not on my headset.,Cons:Factory color settings look bad but don't be afraid very easy to adjust.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Gaming Monitor Currently!,2013-03-23,"Pros:This is a gaming monitor first and foremost! The 144hz is unbelievable and it's really something you need to see with your own eyes, provided you have a GPU that can consistently produce 144+ FPS in games. I also believe that the 24"" size is a pro for this style gaming monitor because personally, anything bigger just seems to be overwhelming  especially if you need to see changes in the map/game instantly. The height adjustment is nice for tall people too, no more lame monitor stands for me to raise it to eye level.","Cons:The only con I can think of currently is getting the default colors to look right. I'm not a photographer or an artist that can recognize ""true"" colors but I'll tell you what I do know. In gaming and movies the colors out of the box seem fine to me but average day to day use and image viewing make the colors just seem ""off"". The fix for me came with the updated drivers and making sure in ""Color Management"" that it was using the ASUS provided color profile. Hope this helps!",Other Thoughts:This really is an amazing monitor! I came from a beautiful Samsung SyncMaster 2280HD so it's not like I went from a Fiat to a Bugatti. I have and will continue to recommend this monitor to anyone who is serious about gaming!,5,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great ""Gaming"" monitor!",2013-03-20,"Pros:Like everyone is saying, 144hz makes a difference. It's difficult to describe, you really need to experience it to understand it. Depending on what games you play will depend on how great the difference is to you. I play primarily FPS games and that is where this monitor shines.If you have a rig of sufficient caliber to run the high fps rates you owe it to yourself to give this a try, you won't regret it.","Cons:As has been said, colors are this monitors achilles heal. If you desire good color calibration and display, you are looking at the wrong monitor. While you can and will need to tweak the settings out of the box, it is difficult to come up with anything I would consider ""good"" color, contrast, saturation etc. I was able to come up with something acceptable for gaming, and of course the more I use it the more accustomed I become.I have 2 rigs, (not counting the kids and the laptop) one set up for gaming (using this monitor) and one setup for photo/video editing and general use, with nice PVA panels. There is no comparison really. The PVA panel is far and away superior color wise.If you are used to IPS/PVA panels, don't expect the color/picture to be similiar, it won't be.If you are coming from a TN panel, color issues may or may not be as noticeable. TN panels vary greatly.",Other Thoughts:The Pros and Cons above pretty much sum it up.Overall I really like the monitor for gaming purposes.

The difference between running at 60 fps and 144 fps is night and day in terms of responsiveness (that's if you the machine to push the frame rate up past the 100 fps mark). The game becomes very life-like in it's movement at this fps.Most of the ""Splendid"" modes are useless for the most part. There are only a couple of these settings that look halfway decent after extensive tweaking. Trying to get acceptable color, gamma, contrast, and brightness levels is like wrestling a polar bear without the aid of a calibration device (which I do not have).Even after going back and forth with various settings the monitor is still not 100%, the overall picture quality and color contrast are definitely lacking, especially on the desktop. When gaming these defects are less noticeable.If you are looking for a monitor to use primary for gaming, and are less demanding with color accuracy, image quality, and a clear screen, than this one will fit nicely.However, if you are looking for vibrant rich colors, sharp contrast, color accuracy and screen clarity on the desktop or in other areas, look elsewhere.",0,0

One segment from the edge of that one to the middle of my monitor and two more segments below that.  The ship would fly from left to right across the screen, the top quarter of the ship just a little ahead of the second quarter and so on...

ASUS,VG278Q,5,One of the best for the money,2013-03-13,"Pros:I was really impressed with the smoothness and brightness the screen presents. When in gameplay the transitions from colors are very smooth, with little to no jitter in the image. Once adjusted the colors are within acceptable range for a TN display.","Cons:The out of the box colors are WAY off, but I tend to expect that from a monitor. The UI controls for color adjustment is on the bottom, and without flipping the monitor, it is really just guess and check. Because the monitor spins, it wants to go slightly past level which is kinda annoying but not enough to change the rating.","Other Thoughts:The brightness.... I turned it on for the first time, in a dark room. THE POWER OF THE SUN IN FRONT OF MY EYES! There were 3 of us, and all of us had to abruptly cover our eyes. VERY bright.

Although I felt yesterday that I had the new Asus unit about dialed in for movies and our simulations. Tried all kinds of ICC profiles and assorted suggested settings but in the end there wasn't much I could do. It just consistently looked washed out and generally blah for everyday use. The panel seemed to have uneven lighting at lower intensity levels (internet and text work). Got really tired of messing with it. I stand by my previous conclusion that the new Asus VG248QE is more a specialty monitor aimed at young gamers and not good for general use and old folks that just want a good general monitor primarily for photo work, home office applications and the occasional movie and game.",3,2

ASUS,VG278Q,5,A gamer's dream monitor,2013-03-01,"Pros:Finally after 10 years of playing on LCD's at 60hz, this monitor feels very close to a CRT display.  I remember so many years ago when I switched from my old 19in. CRT to a 19in LCD and I almost couldn't stand the screen tearing and blurring.  I eventually just dealt with it and learned to play with the blurring.  Although for FPS shooters and playing competitively, a 60hz LCD definitely is a disadvantage.The ASUS VG248qe is just amazing for FPS games.  At 144hz it really is smooth with extremely reduced blurring (yes there is a little bit still).  But it's so much of an improvement, i'm really blown away by it.  I was debating over getting the ASUS or the Benq 2411T.  The Benq is only available in the UK right now, so I went for the ASUS.  Besides, my previous monitor was an ASUS 25.5in LCD and I've been happy with it for several years.I don't see myself ever going back to a 60hz LCD ever again.  It's kind of like when you start watching TV in HD or experiencing BluRay for the first time, and then try going back to standard definition, it's almost unbearable.I also did try the LightBoost registry hack which changes the functionality of the LED back-lighting which is used for Stereoscopic 3D games.   Once enabled, you can disable the stereoscopic 3D so you can game in 2D mode with almost no screen blurring at all.  I was totally blown away how stunningly smooth the picture was.  There is virtually no screen blurring with the hack.  I'm not sure what the side effects are, but one thing is for sure, it's totally sick.","Cons:Colors unfortunately don't look as good at 144hz as they do on 60hz.  You can switch to 60hz for better colors.As other people have noticed, the colors out of the box are very saturated and extremely bright, almost blinding.  You'll have to dial the settings back.","Other Thoughts:I placed my order on Newegg at 12:30PST on a Monday, and they shipped it out the same day.  Amazing.  It arrived within 3 business days.",2,0

The 1ms response time and (roughly) 7ms latency (basing that number off a review of the older brother to this monitor, the VG278HE) means you are getting one of the fastest and most responsive monitors on the market.If you search around on a few forums you can find talk of a ""hack"" to the nvidia lightboost that this monitor supports. Normally lightboost is for 3D, but when playing in 2D you can ""hack"" it to enable the strobing backlight, which ends up eliminating almost every bit of motion blur and other such flaws of your typical LCD. I haven't tried it myself as I do not use an nvidia card, but people who have used it all rave about it being ""like a CRT!"" I can tell you that this monitor is more than worthy of gaming without the hack, but it's something to consider.","Cons:As to be expected of a TN panel, the colors are a bit lacking. I've seen far worse, but if you've used an IPS panel then you've also seen better. After hardware calibration (monitor menu settings) it is plenty suitable for games, and after software calibration (via device like a Spyder4 or similar) then it would be suitable for non-professional color work on images and video.

Sill images were unaffected.I returned that monitor after I had discovered the newly released VG248QE, which was much cheaper due to the smaller size and does not suffer the same pixel inversion pattern issue as the older brother. To be fair, I can still see the inversion pattern on this monitor if I am a few inches away and trying hard to see it, but when viewed from a normal usage distance you can not see it at all. Every monitor has this pixel inversion pattern, some are just more prone to it being visible than others.1080p is more fitting of this 24 inch panel anyway, 27 inches starts to beg for 1440p at least.",30,4

Gets dusty quick and you can get fingerprint smudges on it easily cause it's a glossy plastic,"Other Thoughts:Honestly, you can't beat this monitor if you're using this for gaming or general desktop use. I do a lot of photoshop work, so I had to calibrate the monitor to get accurate colors. IPS panel is better for Photoshop but I wanted to game as well so I got this one. Great choice. You can get the BenQ for like $100+ more, but it's not really worth it IMO.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome Monitor -- Would Buy Again In a Heartbeat,2013-02-17,"Pros:First and foremost, the 144Hz is the best feature of this monitor IMO.  It's really the reason I bought it, and I haven't been disappointed.  I was tired of playing my games at 60FPS with V-Sync On to prevent screentearing, and so far with this monitor I haven't noticed any screentearing whatsoever, even with V-Sync off, and hitting over 300FPS in some games.The color is awesome to me, though I have seen better, but it definitely is the best picture quality of any monitor I've owned.  Side-by-side it blew my old 23"" out of the water.I suppose if you've had much experience on higher picture quality monitors, such as IPS displays, etc, then the picture quality may be offputting for you, but buying a TN Panel you should know what you're in for before hand, so it's not a big deal.  If you are looking solely for picture quality, then a TN Panel probably isn't for you.The swivel/tilt/rotate base is great.  I had this on my old monitor as well, so nothing new here for me, but for those who have never had it, it's definitely worth it.","Cons:This is not a big enough con to take an egg off, especially since I knew before purchasing, but went with this monitor anyway, but there is no VGA input, which for me is problematic, since I use a VGA input for my Xbox 360.However, it ended up not bothering me too much, as I just connected my Xbox via HDMI instead, where the only problem is I'm forced to use the speakers in the monitor, as I could never get one of the separate audio dongles to work with my Xbox while using an HDMI connection, which is why I'd been using the VGA/RCA connection anyway.Not much too say about the speakers.  I got used to them, but they are definitely nothing to be amazed by.  But I've never run into a monitor that had even sub-par speakers before, so nothing new here, and nothing worth taking an egg off for.  Thankfully I don't play Xbox 360 that much.","Other Thoughts:There's not much else to say.  If you're in the market for a new monitor, and prefer response time, and high FPS, over high image quality, then this is a great monitor to consider.If you already have a monitor, but are tired of locking your games with V-Sync at 60FPS when your hardware is capable of so much more, than this is a great monitor to consider.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"For the price, Amazing",2013-02-17,"Pros:The 120/144 refresh rate looks amazing! I thought I wouldn't notice anything above 60hz, but when I look at one of my older monitors, the results are night and day.","Cons:Color, the colors on this thing are way off at factory settings. 20 min. of calibration fixed most of the issues, but it still looks a bit wonky compared to the one I using as a secondary monitor",Other Thoughts:Asus is still awesome,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,When its calibrated - superb quality!,2013-02-15,"Pros:This monitor does come with messed up colors and none of the modes have it right. Your preference may matter, but why not judge this monitor once it has fully calibrated to D65 standard? Each individual monitor requires a separate calibration with hardware colorimeter. Spyder series hardware/software sucks big time. I used i1Display Pro with i1Profiler and got it perfect within 5 minutes confirmed by CalMAN 5 and HCFR.  Once calibrated - this TN panel will good in comparison to many other calibrated TN panels I saw. Blacks are deep enough. Colors are close enough. Overall quality of the image is excellent for a TN panel.Very high response rate. Leave Free Trace at 60 - any higher there is a slight ""corona"" effect due to overdrive.Makes it one of the best for fast-paced gaming.","Cons:This is a TN panel, so do not expect deep blacks or perfect colors. Some grey levels are tad brownish, greenish, bluish, reddish, though not noticeable in any movie or game or photo or picture.3D is not calibrated and I am not sure if its possible to get it right - there is a lack of hardware 3D adjustments.Speakers are just plain lame.Real contrast is about 1:859, which could be better.If you like slow paced games where refresh rate and ghosting are no big deal at all - you may want to consider an IPS panel or S-PVA or even Plasma if you can afford it.","Other Thoughts:The Pros outweigh the Cons - this is a gaming high refresh  monitor with 3D capabilities and low price. These drawbacks are expected to any TN panel, so it may seem a lot, but its really not.",2,1

To be fair, I can still see the inversion pattern on this monitor if I am a few inches away and trying hard to see it, but when viewed from a normal usage distance you can not see it at all. Every monitor has this pixel inversion pattern, some are just more prone to it being visible than others.1080p is more fitting of this 24 inch panel anyway, 27 inches starts to beg for 1440p at least.",30,4
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Great 144 Mhz Monitor,2013-02-21,"Pros:Amazing 144 Mhz smoothness in BF3, Crysis 3 and Black Ops 2.  Reminds me of the old days with a CRT.Motion Blur is significantly reduced.I like the colors just fine after installing an ICC file from Hard OP Forum thread on this monitor.Stand has great flexibility for adjustments.",Cons:TN monitors do not have the color perfection of an IPS monitor.  This monitor is for gaming and casual web browsing.  If you do a lot of Photo work this may not be for you.,"Other Thoughts:If you are a gamer, this is your monitor.  Cheaper than BenQ.DVI output needed to get the 144 Mhz.Am happy I chose this monitor.",1,0

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Very nice!,2013-02-19,"Pros:The resolution on this monitor rocks! No dead pixels, super sharp and bright. The packaging was excellent and the stand is very stylish if I used it. I have a 3 monitor corner stand. It fit right in with my other monitors and even made them look a little worse. As far as gaming is concerned everything works awesome very crisp detail. I have some old games I still play and they don't like the resolution but I can live with that.",Cons:The only thing I can think of is it could have about a 2 foot longer DVI cable. I had a longer one but it was not dual link. No problem I had to adjust my location of tower. Other than that its all cool.,,0,0

Doesn't force you to add 3D emitter if you don't want it (as they are being replaced with newer gen tech fast). This lady fired up out of the box and was effectively packaged. I am coming from a three 42"" plasma 60hz setup. The color performance on this monitor is weaker than my TVs, however, the speed and clarity with which HD video is played back and, of course, games is sah-weeeeeeeet. You really can't go wrong at this price. Been watching this thing since it launched. Do not buy if you require pro-photo-level rendering! Do buy if you are a gamer.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,"Great Monitor, Great Price",2013-02-17,Pros:- No dead pixels- Great mount adjustment- 144hz is amazing with games and even desktop use- Colors are pretty good (once calibrated)- No bleeding- Price- 3D Vision works great on this monitor (I used 3D Vision 2 glasses)- panel has a matte finish,Cons:Needs calibration out of the box (not a big deal though). Gets dusty quick and you can get fingerprint smudges on it easily cause it's a glossy plastic,"Other Thoughts:Honestly, you can't beat this monitor if you're using this for gaming or general desktop use. I do a lot of photoshop work, so I had to calibrate the monitor to get accurate colors. IPS panel is better for Photoshop but I wanted to game as well so I got this one. Great choice. You can get the BenQ for like $100+ more, but it's not really worth it IMO.",0,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome Monitor -- Would Buy Again In a Heartbeat,2013-02-17,"Pros:First and foremost, the 144Hz is the best feature of this monitor IMO.  It's really the reason I bought it, and I haven't been disappointed.  I was tired of playing my games at 60FPS with V-Sync On to prevent screentearing, and so far with this monitor I haven't noticed any screentearing whatsoever, even with V-Sync off, and hitting over 300FPS in some games.The color is awesome to me, though I have seen better, but it definitely is the best picture quality of any monitor I've owned.  Side-by-side it blew my old 23"" out of the water.I suppose if you've had much experience on higher picture quality monitors, such as IPS displays, etc, then the picture quality may be offputting for you, but buying a TN Panel you should know what you're in for before hand, so it's not a big deal.  If you are looking solely for picture quality, then a TN Panel probably isn't for you.The swivel/tilt/rotate base is great.  I had this on my old monitor as well, so nothing new here for me, but for those who have never had it, it's definitely worth it.","Cons:This is not a big enough con to take an egg off, especially since I knew before purchasing, but went with this monitor anyway, but there is no VGA input, which for me is problematic, since I use a VGA input for my Xbox 360.However, it ended up not bothering me too much, as I just connected my Xbox via HDMI instead, where the only problem is I'm forced to use the speakers in the monitor, as I could never get one of the separate audio dongles to work with my Xbox while using an HDMI connection, which is why I'd been using the VGA/RCA connection anyway.Not much too say about the speakers.  I got used to them, but they are definitely nothing to be amazed by.  But I've never run into a monitor that had even sub-par speakers before, so nothing new here, and nothing worth taking an egg off for.  Thankfully I don't play Xbox 360 that much.","Other Thoughts:There's not much else to say.  If you're in the market for a new monitor, and prefer response time, and high FPS, over high image quality, then this is a great monitor to consider.If you already have a monitor, but are tired of locking your games with V-Sync at 60FPS when your hardware is capable of so much more, than this is a great monitor to consider.",1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,4,"For the price, Amazing",2013-02-17,"Pros:The 120/144 refresh rate looks amazing! I thought I wouldn't notice anything above 60hz, but when I look at one of my older monitors, the results are night and day.","Cons:Color, the colors on this thing are way off at factory settings. 20 min. of calibration fixed most of the issues, but it still looks a bit wonky compared to the one I using as a secondary monitor",Other Thoughts:Asus is still awesome,0,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,When its calibrated - superb quality!,2013-02-15,"Pros:This monitor does come with messed up colors and none of the modes have it right. Your preference may matter, but why not judge this monitor once it has fully calibrated to D65 standard? Each individual monitor requires a separate calibration with hardware colorimeter. Spyder series hardware/software sucks big time. I used i1Display Pro with i1Profiler and got it perfect within 5 minutes confirmed by CalMAN 5 and HCFR.  Once calibrated - this TN panel will good in comparison to many other calibrated TN panels I saw. Blacks are deep enough. Colors are close enough. Overall quality of the image is excellent for a TN panel.Very high response rate. Leave Free Trace at 60 - any higher there is a slight ""corona"" effect due to overdrive.Makes it one of the best for fast-paced gaming.","Cons:This is a TN panel, so do not expect deep blacks or perfect colors. Some grey levels are tad brownish, greenish, bluish, reddish, though not noticeable in any movie or game or photo or picture.3D is not calibrated and I am not sure if its possible to get it right - there is a lack of hardware 3D adjustments.Speakers are just plain lame.Real contrast is about 1:859, which could be better.If you like slow paced games where refresh rate and ghosting are no big deal at all - you may want to consider an IPS panel or S-PVA or even Plasma if you can afford it.","Other Thoughts:The Pros outweigh the Cons - this is a gaming high refresh  monitor with 3D capabilities and low price. These drawbacks are expected to any TN panel, so it may seem a lot, but its really not.",2,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Trully AWESOME!!,2013-02-13,Pros:For all gamer's who want to take advantage of that expensive graphics card they got this is its partner.The 144hz and the 1ms response time should be enough of a selling point for any gamer out their looking to upgrade to newer monitor. Games look awesome and smooth(can't believe the stuff i was missing befor) the colors jump out and slap you in the face. You can tilt the monitor to your liking the stand is very sturdy.,Cons:True that the colors suck out of the box as many are stating here. Would of loved to have the option to play my PS3 in 3d but no can do.,Other Thoughts:I have a FW900 and next to that this is my second favorite monitor. The lush visuals and smooth gameplay I now enjoy was enough to say the cash was well spent. Do not hesitate to get this baby before they get to hard to find.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Gaming Monitor,2013-02-13,"Pros:Ergonomic tilt, swivel pivot, and height adjustment are a very nice luxury I don't need to have a monitor stand taking up space on my desk anymore.I love the piano finish on the bezel and the screen has zero to minimal reflection when there is a bright light on or the sun comes through the window and shines on the monitor.Picture quality is very colorful and sharp images after adjusting some settings, I am using:Gamer ProfileBrightness-15Contrast-60Color Temp-User ModeTrace Free-40The Dual Link DVI cable that comes in the box is everything you need (as long as your vid card supports DL-DVI) to get 144hz and 3D no need to buy additional cables.Playing Natural Selection 2 my kdr and overall points per game have gone up almost double, it just seems like I can move faster and see more clearly because of the 144hz and 1ms speeds while constantly looking around it is amazingly smooth. I am surprised at what I can see now without any blur like my old 60hz monitor.I have already recommended this monitor to 1 of my gaming friends and if you are looking at this you should get this too, you won't regret it.Watching HD vids is also crisp and colorful, and having a PS3 paired with this monitor looks really good. Blu-rays, games, psn vids, all look good. Also having the built in speakers is great for smaller PSN/PS3 titles where sound doesn't have to be going through a headset or surround sound (Rainbow Moon, Closure, Hot Shots Golf, etc.).","Cons:Nothing, after initial hook up. It takes some fiddling with the picture quality settings but you need to adjust every monitor to fit to your eye sight.Not all games support 144hz without some tweaking. 120hz is becoming more common, and even some game engines that only support 60hz look very good. The only game I can't get over 60hz/fps is Batman Arkham City, I am sure there is a work around I just haven't found it yet.","Other Thoughts:I ordered this on a Friday afternoon and got it that same night. I decided since I live fairly close to a distribution warehouse I used the Will Call and went to pick it up personally, which only took a couple hours after placing the order.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Amazing,2013-02-08,"Pros:This monitor is the most amazing thing I have ever owned. The stand is amazing, tilt, swivel, and you can raise it vertically several inches. I was able to set it to 144hz using the DVI cable provided. Everything looks absolutely amazing. I do a ton of gaming and play multiple different games and they are all so much better with this monitor. The size is adequate, any bigger and I would need a larger desk.","Cons:The brightness is crazy out of the box. If you are into that you can leave it, but I had to turn it down a bit. People are complaining about the colors but they seem fine, but I have mild colorblindness, lol. No eggs off for the colors or the brightness, just adjust the settings to your preference.","Other Thoughts:You will get the best out of this monitor if you have a powerful system that can play games at 120+ fps.

Also, the settings are all perfect for gaming at their defaults.  I also like the FPS crosshair feature.  1ms GTG is good, too.",Cons:Motion sickness.

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Greatest gaming monitor I've owned,2013-02-07,"Pros:I came from a 24"" Asus 60hz for the last year and that monitor blew away my previous monitor.  Now that one has nothing on this VG248QE.The Colors aren't that bad compared to other TN panels.  In fact, their better than all TN panels I've ever used.The refresh rate at 144hz (assuming you have a video card capable of 144fps) is unreal.","Cons:My only 'Con' is the colors out of box are not good.  It took me a couple of hours of tweaking and using calibration tools to get it where I want it and I still think it can be better with further adjustments.This is true for every monitor I've ever bought so I don't exactly consider it a con, but more of a standard thing that must be done.","Other Thoughts:To say the colors are bad compared to an IPS panel is the same as comparing apples to oranges.  No one ever said the colors of a TN panel are better than an IPS period.  If you play games, don't hesitate on buying this monitor.   If you do a lot of photo editing, buy an IPS panel.  If you do both, then buy both.  If you do not have the money for both, then buy the one you'll get the most use out of.Don't buy this expecting the colors to be the greatest you've ever seen in a monitor.That being said, these colors of this monitor are still not that bad when adjusted correctly...that part takes some time.Another thing, I only adjusted the settings on the monitor itself very small amounts.  Majority of my adjustments were done directly through the Nvidia control panel.  It is much easier to adjust on the fly.",6,1

ASUS,VG278Q,5,Money Well Spent,2013-02-07,Pros:I had been using an LED 1080p TV for my monitor but it was 60 hz. Going that to this is shocking. In Battlefield 3 I got used to everything blurring out as I aimed at someone and moved the crosshair. I thought that was normal and part of the game. Oh was I wrong! Now that I have the 144hz refresh rate enabled there's absolutely no blurring at all when I move or aim.,Cons:I can't think of anything negative to say about this monitor.,Other Thoughts:Cheaper than a BenQ,1,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Smooth as warm butter...,2013-02-07,"Pros:When I turned this monitor on I was amazed at how big it is, my desktop occupies almost as much real estate as my physical desk. This monitor is a lot bigger than I anticipated, I originally had my laptop and a 19"" LG monitor on my desk, this takes up more room by far. My favourite thing about this monitor is I can finally use my 6400 DPI setting on my mouse and not see my mouse skip frames. EVERYTHING is smoother, I spent a good 10 minutes just moving around windows marvelling at the comparison to 60hz. I was slightly skeptical whilst waiting for this monitor to get in wondering if it was worth the money. There is no question now, this thing is worth every cent and then some.","Cons:I now am convinced on upgrading my GPU to push games at 144+ just to enjoy this monitor even more. ATM the only game I can go above 144 is CS:S, which looks amazing just by playing it on this monitor compared to before.","Other Thoughts:Definitely make sure you have the desk room for this monitor, the mount is extremely flexible (ergonomic tilt allows for rotation on 2 axis + a swivel on the base)",4,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Perfect for gaming,2013-02-06,Pros:-Exactly as advertised-Perfect for gaming-Same UI as other ASUS monitors (I always change the colors to my liking)-Everything I wanted in a monitor,Cons:The height adjustment doesn't lock into position. I have to move the monitor about 1-2' (0.53m) to the right pretty frequently and it just slides right back up. Its not really that big of deal so it's still 5 stars in my book. I just think there could easily be a knob on the back that you can slightly tighten to secure the height of the monitor.,"Other Thoughts:Whoever Newegg ships through is horrible. I was taking a nap in the backroom and the delivery guys just pounds on my door. I get to the door and see him getting in a white mini van and then drives off. He just left it at my door step.....I don't live in a good neighborhood if I wasn't home to get it, it would have been stolen within minutes. no signature nothing. Newegg is great, but if they ship me something and it arrives like that again it will be my last time. I'd rather pay more then risk it getting stolen.",2,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Surpassed Expectations,2013-02-06,"Pros:Response Time.  I unlike what appears to be some others from their negative comments bought a gaming panel.  Not a true color reproduction IPS panel to be used in profession grade art, or graphic design work.I game.  I get on my computer, I read webpages upon webpages, watch some youtube or listen to some of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.If I hadn't of put ""I game"" first, second or third on this list, I would have considered an IPS panel like the newest Dell offering that everyone is clamoring about.. but I did.  Why?  because when I am not fixing network issues, security bulletins, or helping end users with our product line I am gaming.This was my out of the box impressions after expecting a lack luster experience with the 3d vision kit I bought with it:Jaw, to, ground in Guild Wars 2.  Called my Son over and put on the glasses, stuck him in a helicopter in Battlefield 3 and saw his Jaw drop to the ground.That said, there are a couple games coupled with the nvidia vision 2 I don't like, black ops 2 for some reason.  I was upgrading from a 59hz Samsung older first gen lcd, Black Ops 2, in 2d on this monitor makes me want to sing out loud and dance a jig.You will need to adjust the color balance and temp by hand don't use the pre-sets, also, mine came with brightness and contrast set to 100%, I would tune those down.I was very afraid my system although in 2d would be fine with 3d vision also, I found that my system runs with this panel a respectable ""average settings"" in 1080p on sli 560ti's (2gig v. from MSI) across D-L DVI.","Cons:I wish the buttons for OSD, Power, etc were back lit.  I would have loved it to be glossy or non matte like a gamers 3d panel should be but I didn't notice much sparkle from it anyway.","Other Thoughts:Very happy with purchase, no dead or stuck pixels.  Box was TORE UP during shipping but the panel and all parts were perfectly fine.",3,0
ASUS,VG278Q,5,A 5 star review to offset my 2 star one before,2013-02-06,"Pros:I had to write this 5 star review to offset my 2 star one, effectively adding another 1.5 eggs, making this a 3.5 egg monitor. It truly is FAST and after using this speed I could never go back to a regular 60hz monitor.Especially in gaming the difference is very noticeable. Everything is very smooth and sniping on TF2 was incredibly fun on this monitor, I hope you guys get a chance to experience 120/144hz someday soon.Also, another huge plus is that switching between applications was slow on my old dell sp2309w... when i alt-tabbed out of games there was a very noticeable delay but with this Asus it's INSTANT. Amazing.","Cons:Wow, people really love to thumbs down a negative review. If you want to dismiss my honest feedback, then go ahead and buy the monitor and see the color problem for yourself. Read on forums and even in other reviews on Newegg, they say the same thing about the color.After hours of calibrating and tweaking, I still can't get the color to be decent and I'm not even that picky when it comes to picture quality. Everything looks completely washed out.Final thoughts are below.","Other Thoughts:I want to love this monitor I really do. It is very fast, nice and bright (which may be part of the problem), and the stand is incredibly intuitive. This is almost a perfect monitor minus the color reproduction.Again, if you don't believe me, instead of thumbs downing my review why don't you buy the monitor and then decide if I am a crazy person or if there is truth to what I am saying.Hopefully after someone figures out good calibration settings this monitor will be as close to perfect as we can get until 120hz ips or oled becomes mainstream.Oh, and I'm keeping the monitor, I can't let go of the 120hz gaming.",6,2
ASUS,VG278Q,2,Bad bad bad,2013-02-05,Pros:Pro's:-120hz/144hz is ultra smooth like butter-stand is very easy to assemble-Many height/tilt/swivel adjustments available,"Cons:The biggest con here is the color... It. is. awful.No matter how many times you try to tweak the settings, everything looks AWFUL. I came from a 3 year old Dell sp2309w and Gosh i'm so disappointed with the color accuracy with this Asus monitor.I'm going to give it one more day of testing and if I can't find good video settings, this one is going back to the egg as a defective monitor.Try to hold off buying this if you can. On paper it looks great but in reality the color reproduction is just terrible... maybe if this were a $200 monitor, the color reproduction can be overlooked in  exchange for the ultra smooth 120hz but still I don't know if it'd be worth it.",,6,21
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Steal of a monitor,2013-02-01,"Pros:144hz is crisp and smooth like I haven't experience in a long timeLow response time.  I've already improved in many of the FPS games I play with how quick this monitor is.The stand is very easy to adjust and assemble.1920x1080 at 144hz is great to view and I no longer have to have VSYNC enabled because of tearing!OSD is easily navigated once you get hang of the Menu button being the middle button, but I haven't fiddled with it too much apart from adjusting the colors.","Cons:Geeze, the colors.  When you first turn this monitor on it's like a sunbeam with how bad the brightness is turned up.  The colors out of the box are horrible, every single preset is horrible.  Do some manual adjusting to get the colors right.I turned Brightness down to 20, Contrast is at 35 and Saturation is around 60 but it's still not perfect.There's some pretty bad backlight bleed.  I have none on the bottom left side however in the middle bottom and bottom right there's noticeable backlight bleed.The viewing angles aren't the best but then again this isn't an IPS monitor and it's meant for gaming so the only person that's going to be viewing it is you but you should've known that when you were buying this over an IPS.","Other Thoughts:No built in 3D emitter, but then again that'd be another $100 you're dropping on this monitor, but for this price it's great.I'm not an expert on monitors but I did lots and lots of research before buying and I was advised to hold off and wait for this monitor because the 27"" version was too expensive for me.  I'm glad I held off.  If you're a gamer I'd highly recommend this in the short time I've owned it.I went from a 120hz CRT monitor to a 60hz LED and I hated the 60hz with a passion.  Going back to 120hz and beyond is as good as I thought it'd be.  Don't listen to the people who say ""120hz or 120 fps doesn't matter past 30 because the human eye..."" blah blah blah.  Any serious or competitive gamer knows this isn't the case.Going from my CRT to the LED I could see the monitor refreshing at 60hz and it put a definite strain on my eyes.  Going back to 144hz I no longer have to furrow my brow and leave it that way because everything is very smooth.",40,5
ASUS,VG278Q,5,great gaming lcd,2013-02-01,"Pros:comes with DL-DVI cable, audio cable (not sure what to do with this)This is VERY smooth compared to 60hz you ahve to see it to believe it. getting head shots in FPS pretty easy now compared to before279.99+8.99 S+H probably will get more expensive at first. Newegg has an auto increase in price when it sells out from my experience.No dead/dim/bright pixels - got lucky I don't think this has a zero bright pixel warranty144hz on normal settings with DP can also do 120,100,85, 60,59,50120hz with light boost on DVI only, can also do 100, 72, 60Great for gaming, top notch, whether in 144hz ""gaming mode"" or 120hz 2d light boost mode.","Cons:I am running on a GTX 670DOES NOT COME WITH DP CABLE!!!!with DL-DVI I can only get it to run at 1920x1080x120hzwith display port I can run at 1920x1080x144hzThe only problem is if you want to run light boost in 2d you can only do it with DVI so it takes some effort to go back and forth. Also if you didn't buy a quality DP cable you can't get it to display at 144hz with the DL-DVL cable that came with this. I tried the one that came with my VG248QE AND the one that came with my u3011 and still only 120hzWhen you first turn it on, the first thing you think is ""MY EYES!!!!"" this is very bright by default.colors are bad, real bad, you have to calibrate or tone the brightness to about 20/100, default is 80/100. the other problem is when you run anything above 60hz the light bleed gets exponentially worse as your hz are higher. I don't know if this is just how the monitor is supposed to run or mine has a QC issue.in 3D mode you cannot change any settings but how high Light boost is. if you play in 2D with light boost on, it seems very dim.bad for anything but gaming esp if you are used to IPS/PVA/PLS panel. screen real estate is very small compared to 2560x1600 you get about 1/2","Other Thoughts:It's a TN panel, calibrated I read that you can have 95% NTSC color gamut, I was gaming on a dell u3011 IPS and this one blows it out of the water when it comes to any kind of motion. but if you are standing still or not moving very much IPS is better.",13,2
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Awesome Monitor for Gaming,2013-02-01,"Pros:As EpicSurvivor mentioned got this monitor yesterday and the smoothness and responsiveness in-game and outside game are amazing over your standard 60hz. As soon as I hooked it up and saw my mouse move I shed a tear.I don't think I can ever go back to 60hz for gaming again. If you are the type of gamer that likes high quality, smooth panning/turning, and dislike screen tearing. This monitor is indeed made for you.","Cons:It is a TN panel, so the colors don't compare to an IPS monitor, but I'd rather have the smooth movement and clarity over superb colors and/or screen tearing.","Other Thoughts:Bottom line, is that this monitor is for gamers no questions. I don't think we'll be seeing anything quite like this for awhile. So I wouldn't be surprised if this was the new ""go to"" monitor as far as performance and price range goes.",9,1
ASUS,VG278Q,5,Best Gaming Monitor For the Price,2013-01-30,"Pros:- Price!- Value- Size 24""- 144hz! (Mind Blown)- Ergonomic- 3D Capable","Cons:Only thing that I can say for now is that the colors out the box don't look good at all, but that is a common thing with Monitors anyway. So  is not really a CON, just have to tweak the settings for personal preference.","Other Thoughts:I'm not exaggerating when I say this monitor is Amazing for Gaming! For the price they are selling, there won't be anything in the market that can get close to its level, not at least for a long while. Yes I know its not IPS, and is only 1920X1080 but let me tell you, this monitor has blown my expectations ""Out The Water"" its not 120Hz but 144hz! Best Upgrade and investment I have made for my gaming rig. The in game image quality out the box its still amazing, the colors and textures are more ""Vivid"" everything is smoother, everything is just fluid, forget about BenQ XL2420T or the BenQ XL2411T (EU) you will end up over paying for those compared to what the VG248QE has to offer.This monitor makes every game feel and look so Crisp! By the time the guy realizes I was behind him and turns around, I already knifed him and took his cookies and knifed the next guy.This VG248QE is replacing my 24"" 60hz Asus VH248QE. Crysis 3 Open Beta looked 5 X better on the VG than the VH. I have NO Screen tearing at all! (Hallelujah! lol)This monitor also has a tilt and swivel ability and you can adjust the height  by simply sliding the monitor Up or Down with no effort at all and tilt it to what ever angle you please even set it on portrait mode with very little effort.It also has 3D but I haven't got chance to test it.Look, I'm not here getting paid by Asus or Newegg to say nice things about this monitor, I'm just a gamer and this monitor is amazing for gaming. GET THIS MONITOR NOW! You will not regret it.I know this is not really a review but I just had to give my positive input about how amazing this monitor has being in only  the first 7 hours since it came in the mail, I've spent 5 of those hours gaming and testing this monitor. I had No dead pixels at all.Oh and even though I paid for 3 day shipping the Monitor arrived 2 days after the tracking information was available from Cali to SC. Thank you Newegg!GET IT NOW!",26,3

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor...once you fix the color...,2017-10-28,"Pros:I've been very happy with this monitor but at first I fought it tooth and nail attempting to get the color right I even considered RMAing it but the cost of shipping it back would have been high.  I struggled with this monitor for over a year trying every adjustment I could, downloading calibration software but the colors were never right...everything was washed out, blacks were a dark gray.Once I learned the simple secret its easy to fix...its basically a TV monitor used as a PC monitor.  See other thoughts on how to correct the color settings in a few clicks...",Cons:It seems it may be a TV style monitor used as a PC monitor see Other thoughts below to fix the colors because with RGB setting everything is washed out.,"Other Thoughts:To fix the color setting for Nvidia users (sorry AMD people but I don't own an AMD GPU)Rright click your desktop and open the Nvidia Control Panel.Under Display open Change Resolution,  At the bottom look for 3. Apply the following Setting next select Use Nvidia color settings, change Output color format from RGB to YCbCr444 and apply.  Once the changes take effect it may ask if you want to keep the changes, select YES.DO NOTE: Any time your Nvidia drivers update you WILL have to repeat this and change the output color format from RGB to YCbCr444 again so make sure you take notes or remember the steps!",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Good monitor but one problem...,2017-10-19,Pros:Good size and display for the price.,Cons:I haven't had the monitor for a full day yet and I see there is either a dead or stuck blue colored pixel near the center area of the screen.

ASUS,VE248H,4,I've had this monitor for 5 years and its great!,2017-09-24,"Pros:Colors are rich, the response time is great and it's very bright. I'm looking into a new monitor sometime into the future so I looked into how far I can push the refresh rate and have been able to get it to 70Hz in the mean time. I don't remember exactly how much I paid for this monitor back in the day but it was around $400-$500, it's safe to say it's transformed into a great budget gaming monitor by today's standards.-Low response time-Matte screenVery durable:-I've taken it to many friend's house for gaming sessions. This monitors also followed me through three living situations, and still no real damages to speak of.-Absolutely no dead pixels, and I've had no major issues during the entire time I've had this monitor.-Seriously, I spend a lot of time on my computer and this monitor still works great even overclocked after all this time","Cons:Everything I am nit picking about the monitor is mostly because I'm looking to upgrade sometime in the nearish future so please understand that I've had a LOT of time spent with this monitor:-Glossy plastic-I've started to notice some blacklight bleed but I'm uncertain if it's because I didn't know what blacklight bleed was when I purchased the monitor or perhaps its age. It isn't much though.-While in the process of building my new computer I used the monitor's audio ports on the back to plug my headphones into as I played games off of my Nintendo Switch. The Switch was connected to the monitor via HDMI. Unfortunately there's this annoying high pitched ring that changes pitch every time something on the screen changes such as simply navigating through the home page. My headphones might have made the sound much more apparent, but I would suggest not planning on using the audio port unless you have to.","Other Thoughts:If all you want is a solid 1080p experience then I can safely say for the price this monitor is great value. Its durability, brightness, and low response time all make this a great gaming and everyday use monitor.",2,1

Originally used with my laptop for many years and later with a desktop I purchased. Has served me great. I never expected a piece of electronics to last so long while still remaining relevant (1080p is still average).

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Excellent 27"" Monitor",2017-05-24,"Pros:If there is a 27"" monitor on the market at anywhere close to this price with a better-looking screen, I've yet to see it.  I've only had it a week so I can't speak for its reliability, but the picture is excellent straight out of the box.  With a little tweaking, it's superb.  No dead pixels and laser-beam bright if you wish it so.  My 5-year-old Hanns-G 24"" monitor became increasingly difficult to wake up after a shut-down until finally, it wouldn't wake up at all, so I replaced it with this Asus.  Paired with my Radeon R7-370 video card, the colors are vibrant, the blacks are black, and I see no ghosting or blur whatsoever.   The picture on this monitor with the same video card is head and shoulders above the Hanns-G.  I will try to revisit this review after I've had the monitor a year or two and we'll see if I'm still this happy with it.  So far, I have no complaints and only accolades.","Cons:None that I've found yet.  The only change I would make on this monitor would be to include a DVI input.  The monitor comes with 1 D-Sub (VGA) input and 2 HDMI inputs.  It also comes with a DVI to HDMI adapter cable, so that shouldn't really be a problem.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this monitor to anyone in the market for a reasonably priced 27"" monitor with a superior-looking screen.  I don't know anything about the included speakers in the monitor.  I use a separate sound system so I never hooked those in the monitor up.  Newegg shipping was once again top-notch.  I ordered this monitor on Tuesday morning and it was delivered Wednesday afternoon with the standard free shipping.  There's a reason I've been buying from Newegg for well over a decade, and this is a good example of why.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Almost 6 years going and still a great monitor,2017-05-21,"Pros:2ms, overclockable, sturdy stand, standard power plug, and ASUS quality.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Very good display. I used this for about a few years then got an LG ultrawide and put this in the closet. Needless to say the LG had a black line appear one day and only a 1 year warranty so I pulled this back out. Although not the same resolution but the quality was much better as the warranty should have been a clue. Using DVI-D cable to overclock to 74hz vs. LG which was locked to 60. The old saying quality vs quantity is true in this case. Even though wife gave me the okay to buy another I don't see any reason to unless this unit dies or I do.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,How many 5 eggs can I give for this? They're incredible.,2017-05-11,"Pros:At first I was skeptical when buying this. I was seeing so many critical reviews saying how faulty these monitors are. I've bought two of them and set them up on my PC along with my initial monitor, making three total monitors. Comparatively speaking to my acer monitor, these run much cooler. The screen is just as crisp and clear with quite the vibrant color display.","Cons:Would be nice if it came with a display port cable. Other than that minor bump, I have yet to really encounter any cons.","Other Thoughts:Other reviews give this a 1 egg or a 2 egg because of ""faulty speakers,"" ""ghosting images"" when using it for gaming, or just overall not worth the hassle. I ordered two of these despite those reviews because I wanted to see them for myself. These speakers are even better than the ones I ordered when my last pair died. I just finished playing Skyrim: Special Edition upon writing this and I experienced *no* ghosting. I kind of wish I bought these monitors a while back because so far, they've been amazing at getting me back into the multi-monitor world since my second acer monitor's circuit board fried. Those 1 or 2 egg reviews just had the bad luck of the draw in getting faulty monitors. They had that 1/1000 chance of getting defects. These monitors are amazing.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Best Monitor I've had. Worth the money!,2017-05-10,"Pros:Picture, features, brand","Cons:I haven't really found any other than the awkwardness of navigating the menu, but what monitor doesn't have that?","Other Thoughts:I've had this monitor for a few years now and it has been great. Don't listen to all these OCD individuals saying it has bad ghosting or whatever else they may be saying. When it comes down to it, you can't even notice that kind of stuff unless you run tests, which if you are that particular then you need to spend a little more money on a monitor anyway. I am a gamer and I love this thing. So much in fact I'm waiting on my second one to arrive any day now. Can't wait! I also play my Xbox one S on this monitor as well and it looks great.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,7 years and going strong,2017-04-03,"Pros:I have had one for 7 year and I'm about to order another. I got this as a christmas present in 2010. It was used for intense gaming for 4 of those 7 years and the other 3 in my mothers law office until i built another PC. It was even used as a bedroom TV for a few months when i didnt have a pc.It plays The Division, WoW, GTA V, All borderlands games and even used it as a tv for an xbox in the hdmi port and was my pc in the DVI port. I could switch between the two with the push of the button.",Cons:The only con of this monitor is there is better ones out now. They will always be coming out with newer and better things but as far as 1080p goes its hard to beat 7 years of reliability and still be a relevant gaming monitor.The only thing this monitor needs is a remote because its basically a TV.,,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,Decent Monitor,2017-03-17,"Pros:Decent price, though it is an older monitor.","Cons:One of the two I bought has been giving a ""No Signal"" error from the DisplayPort if it turns off or goes to sleep for too long. You have to unplug the DisplayPort cable AND the power cable, then plug the power cable in first for it to recognize signal from the DP cable. I know it's not the video card or the cables because I have swapped the cables between the two monitors and to different ports on the card and both monitors react the same way: one works just fine, the other gives an error until it's unplugged and then plugged in again(power first, then DP).","Other Thoughts:Better quality control?

ASUS,VE248H,5,I sure am glad I choose this monitor!!,2017-03-04,"Pros:My 6 year old 22"" Dell Monitor finally went out 2 weeks ago, and I very nearly almost bought a ASUS VS278Q-P 27-Inch Monitor. But after reading the mixed reviews regarding the quality and other issues of that monitor, I choose this one. I am so glad I did!!The new monitor arrived with very good, tight quality packaging with all the cables and directions included. I took a little while to get it all connected and set up, but when I powered it up it looks beautiful!! There is no strange off colors, no dead pixels, no weird bizarre lines, or any other quality issues. The screen looks very bright and clear, and the menus are very easy easy to use as well as the buttons.","Cons:The smaller font text is a bit faint, but that's always going to be the case with a much larger screen.",,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesomeness,2017-02-20,"Pros:big, bright, beautiful.No dead or stuck pixels.",Cons:Stand height not adjustable,"Other Thoughts:I bought this for gaming, as I was finally realizing the benefit of a wide screen (compared to my 19"" 1280x1024) - fewer people sneaking up on me from the side!  I have not noticed any ghosting, tearing, or streaking.  The first time I fired it up, it felt more like i was participating in an interactive movie.  My old monitor wasn't bad (hyundai imagequest L90D+, high end when i got in in 2005!), but I still have it on my desk next to this one for an extended desktop and it seems pale and washed out in comparison.EDIT: I just saw that Newegg still sells this monitor, and am updating my original review to note that I've had this for 5 1/2 years and still no issues.  If you want an inexpensive, no-frills wide screen monitor that will last for years you may want to consider this one.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"Have two, never dissapointed",2017-02-03,"Pros:Great picture, always find at a great price, ports for days, very sturdy  and reliable, mountable (giggity)",Cons:Does not have a VGA input... (is this even really a con?)Doesn't make me coffeeIsn't sentient,"Other Thoughts:I bought one of these about 9 years ago (still working) and a second one of these a couple years ago. They have always been great monitors. The sound quality of the built in speakers isn't bad at all, the volume control is typically easy to get to, the picture quality has held up on my almost decade old one pretty well. It has different screen modes depending on what you prefer, they are all adjustable after setting to it too.Picture in picture (because why not?)The box it comes in is great for carrying it or moving it around to lan parties, xbox ps4 parties or whatever you're doing with it.

ASUS,VE248H,1,You Get What You Pay For...,2017-01-21,"Pros:- The Screen is a solid LCD with vibrant colors. I'm very happy with performance once it's up and running (as long as I don't let the computer enter sleep mode)- With the mail-in rebate, this is an excellent monitor for the price- Polite customer service, easy to reach","Cons:- First, the monitor does not have auto-sense input capability. This would not normally be a problem, except- Second, the monitor does not let you use the menu button (needed to change input source) unless you are ALREADY on a working input. Again, this would be a minor problem except- Third, the default input for both my monitors was VGA. My newer graphics card only supports HDMI and DVI, so I was unable to connect the monitors to my PC without using a third device. I was forced to connect both monitors to my old laptop that supported VGA in order to change the input to HDMI. Only then was I able to connect to my PC.- Fourth, the mail-in rebate process is a royal pain. One of the requests is for a copy of the order summary / invoice, but the receipt sent by newegg.com to your email is NOT SUFFICIENT. My rebate was denied simply because it did not say ""Shipped"" on the order summary (though you also have to mail in information contained in the physical packaging, so it's obvious the item arrived at my claimed address, as seen in the order summary I sent). Fortunately, I have been given the opportunity to resubmit my rebate (though I sent all the information I had been given originally so I'm not sure what is needed - also the FAQ and website are not very helpful)- Lastly, if the computer is put to sleep, I have the ability to wake it from either keyboard or mouse. However, the monitors do not wake (no matter what I try with either peripheral input device). Plus, if I turn off the monitor, it seems unable to reconnect with the now awake PC, forcing me to shut down the entire system in order to come back up correctly. VERY IRRITATING.","Other Thoughts:I recommend this product to someone on a budget who has the means of manipulating the set-up of the monitors, as once they're up and running they work beautifully, and who does not plan to let their machine enter sleep / hibernation.However, the design mistakes (that should not have been difficult to include) mentioned in the Cons section, coupled with the pain of the rebate process (which is one of the major reasons I purchased this product), makes me believe better options are available. If I could do it over, I would pony up an extra $20 dollars and purchase a better designed product. Disappointed in ASUS, and most likely will not come back.",1,5

This thing is unkillable, not even a single dead pixel or crack. It has even been used in my business vehicle as a demo PC , it is rock solid! I used this PC monitor with 3 different mobo lifecycles, a saber tooth 990fx gen3 r2.0, a crosshair v formula-z and finally in an Intel based Rampage V Extreme, since 2011 it has not skipped a beat.","Cons:It isn't 4K , but in its defense 2k was but a dream, and 4K and g-sync was not even a dream yet. It has no visible cons other than the speakers being meh ( I only use them when the surround sound is not easily used or can't be used.","Other Thoughts:I would buy them for any customer in need of a computer monitor, it will last them a long time, obviously longer than a PC can!",1,1

I contacted ASUS, described the problem and attempting to resolve the issue through their basic instruction, but finally they accepted that the product was defective and issued an RMA. Then I attempted to receive a rapid replacement. This processes has not gone well. After 2 weeks and many  phone calls I have been unable to procure a replacement.

Thus far this is a disaster. I am afraid I might break the ""swiveling device"" when trying to free it.  BTW, I am not a klutz when it comes to electronics & tools. What a hassle this is. I expect the adjustment mechanism was originally damaged before shipment as the instruction pictures indicated one needs to attach it. It came attached AND jammed.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Dont waste your Time,2016-10-06,Pros:There are no pros to a company that has known issues with speakers and still continues to use the same companies.,Cons:Speakers don't work half the time the buttons never work when pressed.  Every single ASUS product I have ever owned has these same issues so take it from me this company isn't worth it.,Other Thoughts:I own this monitor and a ASUS n550j Laptop that you have to increase the sound to 40 for it to even start working abd a and a pb287q  monitor worth $500 with the exact same issues.

This is my fourth RMA (not only on this product) in a row in which the repair/replacement has take over 4 weeks.  I would recommend if indeed you need service buy  a replacement immediately, especially if your computing needs are important (something Asus doesn't seem to comprehend).

ASUS,VE248H,5,works great,2016-07-01,"Pros:Great size for my needs. Basically plug and play. Options are pretty easy to figure out. When I stream sports to it from my cable company it looks nicer than my older TV. Games play nicely with it, haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary. Has the mounting holes on the back, which I should use to get rid of my con, but I haven't yet, so it's a pro that they're there.","Cons:Stand is slightly flimsy for sitting on a table top if you're playing racing games. My steering wheel feedback shakes it around pretty good, but not excessively. The mounting holes and doing a hard mount would likely fix this though, so hardly a legit con.It also shakes when my cat decides to use it as a tightrope walk at 3am... so if you have cats beware of that...","Other Thoughts:I'm not tech savvy enough to provide extensive details, but for an average user I think it works great.",1,1

It does that quite well, I personally like the brightness and contrast levels of the monitor, and have not noticed any colors bleed. Have not seen any ghosting but this monitor will most likely never see a video game. I have been satisfied will every monitor i have purchased from ASUS, great prices, definition, and mine have all lasted forever.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"Simple setup, lots of options",2016-06-22,"Pros:After reading plenty of reviews, I decided to go with this monitor over the BenQ RL2755HM (especially because when I received the BenQ, the HDMIs never worked) and I am very satisfied! I set it up on my desk and immediately started playing Destiny on Xbox One switched to the game mode setting. There are plenty of options to change the colors and hues etc but I found that out of the box it was exactly what I needed. Picture is sooo clear and I can seriously feel the difference between using this monitor and a TV.","Cons:None so far. I did notice one time I turned on the monitor and a blue line was going through the screen, but I just hit the power on/off and it went away.",Other Thoughts:Definitely recommend to casual/moderate gamers.

It doesn't have 144 hz, or 1 ms response time for gamers, its not 1440p or 4k, For photogrophers, and graphic designers, its not a ips panel, so it doesn't have good viewing angles, or color accuracy, or panel uniformity, or anything that professionals would need in a monitor.

ASUS,VE248H,5,This beast of a screen survived getting run over by a car,2016-05-08,"Pros:-Inexpensive-Beautiful-Actually surviving getting run over by a carOne beautiful morning, I was heading home from a fun LAN-party. I had asked my mother to drive me home because I didn't have an drivers license.I had to take multiple trips to the car, because carrying both the screen and a computer didn't work all that well for me. On the first trip I placed my screen behind the car. Little did I know this would reveal me the true nature of this godly screen.I went back towards the building to get my computer, and on the trip back to the car. My mother, who was waiting in the car, made the decision that it was a good idea to meet me halfway so that I didn't have to walk that far carrying my computer. She had somehow forgotten that the screen was still standing behind the gosh darn automobile.When she backed up, the screen got stuck between the wheel and the fender, and dragged literally 20 meters until she saw me running towards the car screaming for her to stop the car.The screen had gotten stuck on its underside down, so the backside was completely ruined and scratched up, the foot who was holding up the screen had been smashed. But the screen, oh the screen, it survived. The panel was a little bit bent, but somehow it had not broken.All I had to do to return it to its former glory, was to attempt to attach the broken foot. I just took a screw and jammed it in, and it both survived and it now has something to stand on.Out of all the negative things that could happen, I only managed to get one positive thing out of this whole incident. And that was CURVED LED TV™",Cons:-It's very plastic and feels cheap,Other Thoughts:-Buy this to pay respects,4,0

ASUS,VE248H,1,It just did not do it form me.,2016-04-29,"Pros:More real estate and picture in picture, which I did not get a chance to try.","Cons:After 2 hours of operating time a dead pixel popped up. Terribly disappointing seeing as my previous monitor was open box and came with a dead pixel. This monitor was brand new, shame. RMA'd and due to stock it was only available for refund. Apparently I bought the last one.","Other Thoughts:Like I said I had to return it. Later on turned into a great situation. Did some research and found my way to a website that starts with A and ends with N where I found the 278H, a 2 year newer model. It was 3$ dollars cheaper than the 278Q. The 278H has 50 million contrast ratio vs the 10 million of the Q model. No picture in picture, but display port is replaced with a HDMI output making the H model have 2 HDMI ports.

As far as I can see, only 1 dead pixel between the 2 monitors.","Cons:Not a con, per se, but be careful, when turning off the power, that you don't hit the 'mode' button right next to it.  I did that and thought my monitor went bad when I turned it on the next morning.  A little concerened until I figured out what had happened.","Other Thoughts:These monitors are not used by me for gaming or HD video watching on any kind of regular basis.  I cannot compare the video quality  for that purpose.  However, for day to day office-type usage, these screens are superb.Also, I do not use the built-in speakers, so I cannot comment on the sound quality.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Really good monitor,2016-04-19,Pros:I've had this monitor for about 4 years now and it's yet to give me a problem.Great resolution and vivid colors,"Cons:Ports are on the bottom, which makes installation a pain at times if you need to move your monitor a lot.You can't choose where the sound comes from, so if you rely on the built in speakers but also like to use the headphone jack in the monitor, that can be a pain.","Other Thoughts:If it went on sale again, I'd definitely consider getting a couple more.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,HDMI Died Right After Warranty,2016-04-18,Pros:Great Monitor,Cons:HDMI died right after warranty....  First time if had the components die before the screen on any of my monitors...,Other Thoughts:Plan on it lasting 3 years then after that its a draw.,0,0

I can't rotate it at any angle without having to dance with the HDMI cable for minutes on end. Wouldn't buy if I knew this beforehand.-Speakers are abysmal. Imagine taking a cell phone speaker, placing it in a tin can, and playing a midi version of Metallica's Unforgiven.-Fairly large and clunky.","Other Thoughts:Had it for about two years now, still working fine save for the HDMI port.

Crystal clear, great blacks.Even includes speakers!","Cons:Mine has one funny pixel that sometimes turns red on dark/black images, so that's a bit annoying.  Most of the time I forget it's there and can't even find it, but I've never had an LCD screen with a defective pixel before so I expect nothing but perfection.  It's still not annoying enough to repackage and ship this huge thing back.  Not doing that.","Other Thoughts:Aside from the pixel, this monitor is wonderful.  Especially at a $200 price point.

ASUS,VE248H,4,A great monitor except for some fixable ghosting issues.,2016-03-27,Pros:This monitor has pretty good color once properly calibrated and at 1080P is still very viable for high definition content.,Cons:The ghosting which is EXTREMELY noticeable with dark objects against a lightly colored background can be very annoying if not remedied.,"Other Thoughts:I would recommend a different model ASUS monitor as this one has the annoying ghosting issue, but it is fixable if you already own one. Press and hold the menu button, then click the power button and let go of both. The monitor will turn on without its typical splash screen. Press menu and a blue monitor BIOS menu will appear. Press up, menu, down, menu, down, menu, then wait a bit and press the far left S/A button to close the regular settings menu. The goal of these steps is to disable the OD mode which actually causes the ghosting. Keep in mind that this process will have to be redone every time the monitor goes to sleep or an input is interupted or changed, but the good news is that once you have turned on the monitor with the menu/power combo, every time you press the menu button, the bios controls will pop up first.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Good monitor.,2016-03-24,"Pros:Large, easy to set up, simple to assemble the stand. Inputs are easy to get to.  Offers a headphone jack just in case  you need it.

Box took a beating during shipment but the product was not damaged.",Other Thoughts:Good price for a decent monitor. I replaced an aging lcd 1080p 42 inch tv and thought this would be terrible. Its not bad..at all for the price. Im quite happy with it.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Nice Monitor But Not Without Quirks,2016-03-20,"Pros:Clean looking, bright sharp colors, plethora of control options.","Cons:Whenever the computer sleeps, the auto detect continuously sounds the device connect and device disconnect every 4-5 seconds untill you wake the computer from sleep mode.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Pleased!,2016-03-04,"Pros:I am a software developer and have become accustomed to using dual monitors.  One of my older 19 inch monitors stopped working so I went on the search for a new pair.  I narrowed my choices to this Asus and a very similar ViewSonic monitor.  I know both these companies make really good products, but ultimately decided on the Asus.  I am very happy I did so.  The screen has excellent clarity and contrast.  The 2ms response time is outstanding.  The cable connections are easy enough to access and the manual adjustments are convenient and intuitive.  I like that the monitor is energy efficient.  And, frankly, they look good sitting on my desk!","Cons:Some of the other reviews mentioned poor speakers.  No, not the greatest sound, but I use separate external speakers anyway, as you probably should also no matter what monitor you own.My only criticism is it would be nice if the height were adjustable.  But that is quite minor and doesn't affect the quality of the product.  They are VESA compliant, so I may eventually mount them on a monitor arm stand.","Other Thoughts:I have a KVM switch so I can run both my desktop and work laptop on the dual monitors.  The KVM has one VGA and one DVI output, thus I have to connect one monitor using DVI and the other using VGA.  There is, as you would suspect, a noticeable difference in the monitor with the digital feed versus the other with the analog.  I plan on upgrading my video card and KVM so I can run DVI and/or HDMI to take full advantage of my new monitors.I would definitely recommend this monitor and if had it to do over, would not hesitate to purchase it again.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Good, and not so good.",2016-03-02,"Pros:Nice settings, clear picture, great price point.",Cons:One of my two monitors went white after 1 week of use.,"Other Thoughts:I spent $2000 on a pc build, which included 2 of these monitors. I got these on time, and everything was great. My pc went to sleep, and one monitor never woke up, this was only after one week of use. No matter what I did the screen was all white, with no picture. Obviously newegg is going to replace it, but I am going to be without the monitor for 2 weeks or more until they get my old one, process it, and send me a new one. I think newegg needs to learn from ""Other online sites"" and maybe send me out a replacement right away. I am not very happy with the inconvenience. Being a premier member and a repeat customer I was hoping for a little more support. The monitor that is still working looks good, and I am overall happy with the purchase.

ASUS,VE248H,3,A bit fuzzy,2016-02-11,Pros:- No dead pixels- Large screen- Still works,"Cons:- After getting this I realized that 1920x1080 is just not a high enough resolution for a monitor this big- Blurry/fuzzy.  I always thought the monitor was a bit fuzzy compared to the older 23"" I had on my desk.  After a little more than a year of using the monitor I started experiencing some weird vision problems. A few months after that, I started getting a lot of headaches and dizziness.  6 months after that (and a ton of money spent on tests and doctors), I find out I have severe eye strain, so I can't use it anymore.- Speakers functional but quiet",,3,3
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor!,2016-02-09,"Pros:- Very good price- Looks nice- Picture is fantastic (good for gaming, movies, coding, anything you can think of)- Backlight is nice and bright- Reliable (I've had it for 4 years and not a single problem)- Perfect size for the resolution (wouldn't go any bigger at 1920x1080 imo)- Smooth performance- Tough (Moved it around MANY times since I've had it, taking it to Lans and moving, etc)","Cons:- Adjusting settings can take a bit of getting used to- As others have said, speakers aren't worth their weight but I've only used them once or twice MAX- MINOR ghosting, as in I notice it when scrolling quickly through a page of black text on white or moving my mouse cursor over a white screen. Barely noticeable unless you're actually looking for it.","Other Thoughts:I've had this monitor since mid-December of 2011 and have loved it ever since - not once have I had a problem with it. I'm actually writing this review because I'm most likely going to order another one for a dual monitor setup and at $139 (with rebate), you can't beat it. It may not be 4k or 144 Hz but it looks incredible for what it is, especially at its price range. Would 100% recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for a cheap but awesome display!",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Long Shelf Life Can mean Good Things,2016-02-04,Pros:Nice & sharp a year and a half ago and nice & sharp today. Old one still at default settings so new one matches perfectly. GREAT VALUE!,Cons:Plastic edging is a bit wide for multi-monitor setups. But could buy several of these for the cost of a single Other.,"Other Thoughts:Just bought a second one of these to match the one I bought in September 2014. Really says something that a monitor that was available a year and a half ago is still on sale today.  First one's still rocking (DVI-input only, so I can't can't say anything about DisplayPort or speakers or picture-in-picture).",2,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Not new anymore!,2016-01-09,"Pros:27"" for an ok price.","Cons:Screen had one dead pixel from day one.  No big deal!  However, within six months a line of dead pixels appeared across three quarters of the top of the screen.","Other Thoughts:ASUS was nice enough to issue an RMA, and fortunately I saved the original box and all the packaging so I shipped the monitor back. ASUS repaired the monitor within a day and had it shipping back to me the next.  Upon opening the box, which was not an original box, I noticed the monitor was shipping in rigid plastic with simple bubble wrap covering the screen. The edges of the monitor are marred by the rigid plastic. The corners of the monitor are slightly scuffed and I can see glue.  The screen is big and bright again. Games look really good.  No dead pixels.  However, with the marring and the scratched, glued corners I feel I do not have a ""new"" monitor anymore.  I've bought other ASUS components in the past and have never had a problem until now.  I don't think this experience will put me off of ASUS in the future, but it will be worth considering.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent monitor!

ASUS,VE248H,3,Basic Monitor with Limitations,2015-12-23,Pros:Various Inputs & half decent response time.,"Cons:2 dead pixels upon power up. One dead pixel remains in the right/center of the screen. The other pixel will intermittently flicker on/off which is annoying. Colors across the spectrum are not vibrant. They are not bad, just ""Dull"" for the lack of another word. I have tried to adjust the setting on the monitor itself, with a nominal improvement. I checked/changed resolutions on my Video Card (XFX Radeon HD 6770) etc. No real improvement. Yes - The firmware for this video card is up to date. I connected up another older Acer  23"" Monitor via DVI-D cable & the image on this monitor is better overall even though this is unit is 4 plus years old.","Other Thoughts:Would I buy this again, No - this was & will be my last ASUS branded monitor. I have had much better luck/success with ACER, HP monitors. Looking over other reviews of this product, others have commented on the dead pixel issues & the colors not being what they should be.  I can't comment on the speakers, because I don't use them. My recommendation to ASUS would be to have a better quality control dept. to identify/isolate/resolve these issues prior to leaving the factory.",0,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,Decent Monitor for price,2015-12-03,"Pros:Great size, price and advertised features that do work.","Cons:Very bad horizontal tearing in games when V-sync is turned off sometimes in movies as well with large moving action scenes.  Much worse than my smaller monitors.  I supose that is to be expected with a 27"" model though,  The 72hz max refresh rate only works at resolutions of 800x600 or less. Again this is to be expected so 60hz max at 1080p.  I used to use this monitor as my main gaming rig monitor for its size.  I recently upgraded it to a another 27""  with 1440p and 144hz.  This monitor now is my secondary pc movie watching/streaming/media center PC unit.  It does an ok job with Blu-Ray's and streaming netflix and such but honestly my 1080i 50"" Plasma tv looks much better so I cannot recommend this unit for someone planning to use it as a tv or media center monitor.","Other Thoughts:Not a bad monitor at all, as I said I used it as a daily driver for a couple of years and was fine with it.  A few months ago I really got the itch to upgrade so i did a lot of research and found an new one. I give it 4 stars because I have never had a single issue with this unit, never a dead pixel, never a failure to come on when turned on, never as much as a hiccup other than all the horizontal tearing about 1/4 from the top of the screen on almost every game(sometimes even with v-sync on and thats why I didnt give it 5 stars)  This is a good daily use monitor for people doing light gaming and standard net browsing and the like.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,4 years and still going strong,2015-12-02,"Pros:Owned this monitor for over 4 years and it still works great. Was so unimpressed by another monitor I tried out that I just bought another one of these for a friend's build.- Wide, stable connections from base to monitor prevents any wobbles- Great picture quality without having to make a ton of adjustments- No dead pixels, even after 4 years.- Bezel is not reflective so you don't get any screen mirroring in it","Cons:- Monitor sits a bit low, but this is easily rectified by raising it up with something solid underneath the base",,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Great Picture, Great Monitor",2015-11-30,Pros:Picture quality is very good and offers multiple quick select settings.,"Cons:I read some reviews that the stand was just too flimsy - and it is a bit flimsy - but if you're not a rabid gamer (slamming your mouse, keyboard, etc) you'll never even notice this.  I would had preferred a more stable stand, but it certainly isn't anything to be concerned with.The controls for selecting which type of picture you want was a bit confusing at first, but once you get the idea, they work just fine.","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these monitors because I have a dual monitor set up and wanted identical monitors.  I'm very happy with my purchase after a year.  Quality and response is still like the day I bought them.  The only real drawback is the stand, but I think this will really only impact people who are aggressive gamers, or have a very unstable desk that they're sitting on.  Otherwise, the stands aren't noticeable at all.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor for the price,2015-11-23,"Pros:Needed a replacement 24"" monitor and found this ASUS monitor on sale for under $150.Pros:Very brightGood resolutionAuto inputIncludes VGA, DVI & 3.5 mm audio cablesAttractive case",Cons:The inputs are under a flap in the back with very little distance from the case - making it a little tricky to screw in the DVI/VGA cables unless you have the finger size of an 8-yr-old.The stand base has a smallish footprint (1/2 the size of my HP 2311 monitor base) - so it could be wobbly if used in an area where it might be bumped.,"Other Thoughts:Overall - I'm very happy with this monitor. The color clarity and separation is excellent and it paints true black (a feature common with LED monitors). I gave it 4 eggs instead of 5 because of the small stand base and input connector clearance, but frankly, I could give this 5 eggs as it is a quality unit for a bargain basement price if you happen to find it on sale.",0,0

Now over the last 6months, have slowly had a pale green light spread from the lower left corner of monitor to to cover about 33% of the left side of the screen.

With 3 connectors (VGA, DVI, HDMI) you can connect 3 computers at once, turn them all on, and cycle between them - useful for transfers between computers.","Cons:Switching between VGA / DVI / HDMI inputs is a little sketchy.  It takes anywhere from 2 seconds to 10 seconds, depending on how long the button (on the bottom of the monitor, where it's indistinguishable from the other monitor controls) takes to register a keypress.  Sometimes, multiple keypresses are needed (which takes longer).","Other Thoughts:I can run S.T.A.L.K.E.R. FPS games at max resolution with no ghosting on this monitor.

It does everything I would expect,"Cons:Don't have any expectation of actually getting the rebate back for this item.

I asked everyone's best friend Google about the issue and found out that unplugging the power cable from the monitor for about 10 seconds or so then plugging it back it fixes this issue.,Other Thoughts:Surround gaming on these babies is completely amazing love it.,2,0

It also came with all the relevant cables, including hdmi to dvi.",Cons:None yet.,"Other Thoughts:Alot of people here are claiming about ambiguous display configuration problems, like it's too bright, or the colors being off. I haven't played games in years, and I'm not a videophile. To me, this monitor looks great, and I just use redshift(f.lux for you sad fools using windows) to lower the brightness.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Great monitor, picture in picture is cool!",2015-06-26,"Pros:I bought this monitor to add to my current dual monitor setup.  It is much brighter and more vibrant than my pair of Hanns-G HL272's, I had to tone down the default settings a bit so it wouldn't stand out so much from the other two.  Lots of configuration options in the OSD.",Cons:The layout of the buttons on the bottom of the display are rather non-intuitive when using the OSD menus.,"Other Thoughts:Has all the right inputs, and the built-in speakers are a nice feature to have I guess but I don't intent to ever really use them.  The OSD menus look pretty.  I didn't realize this when I bought it, but this monitor has PIP (picture in picture) capabilities!  You can use this to view a second input in a window on the monitor.  Seeing as I have this monitor sitting in the middle of two other 27"" displays I don't see myself using this feature very much, but still very cool if you don't have that kind of ridiculous screen real estate to work with.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Wish I had two more!,2015-06-25,"Pros:They just look great. I've been using a 22"" Dell fluorescent tube-lit monitor with 6ms response and a 19"" Philips TV as a dual setup. Bought two of these  on sale with a coupon code and rebate for a very low price after comparing everything offered on Newegg. They set up easily and, after I figured out how to operate the on-screen display and set them up just the way I wanted them, I've been completely satisfied with their performance. My desk isn't the sturdiest, but I haven't noticed any wobbliness at all. No dead pixels and very sharp font display. I'd like to add two more because I can never have enough display real estate.","Cons:Although I love my monitors, I have to agree with those who weren't happy with the speakers. Seriously, they can only go to about 1/2 - 2/3 of the volume of ""normal"" speakers. When watching a video course that started with low audio output I couldn't hear the presenter very well. Had to break out some old speakers and hook them up. I really don't know what ASUS was thinking when they hacked these speakers into this monitor. The speakers are truly disappointing. It almost cost a star on this review, but the display made up for the difference.","Other Thoughts:I'm not a gamer by any means, but I do take my Flightgear flight sim seriously. The 1920x1080 resolution is perfect for displaying the cockpit instruments and also the scenery as it unfolds in the distance. Using an ASUS ENGTX560 DCII OC 2DI 1GD5 graphics card to display from.

This would be when I bought this product I was under the impression that I would have drivers for it via disk or an internet available source ""without having to buy a program to do so"", I was wrong... With several attempts with several sources, including Asus's home driver site, I can not seem to get current drivers and my OS, Win 7 pro, still wants to consider this product a generic device.","Other Thoughts:NO...

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2015-06-19,"Pros:I bought this monitor to replace my old 21.5"" I had been using. This monitor is absolutely perfect! It was a little bright, but there are 6 preset settings that you can easily switch from, or you can fine tune it to what you like.

ASUS,VE248H,4,My first monitor for console gaming,2015-06-18,"Pros:I love this clarity, color, and response times of this monitor. I had no idea that a monitor would make this much difference on my conose gaming and graphics. I just never thought that a smaller screen would ever replace my 46 inch led sony bravia tv.

I just upgraded to a VG248QE and looking at them side by side this monitor favors yellows a good bit. Whites are very inaccurate and if you can find a customized inf file for this monitor it will most likely help.

This monitor is no exception, with proper calibration it provides a great picture.A comment on the sound, I don't use the speakers built-in.  Why?Who thinks a speaker, 1 inch in size, is going to provide any quality sound?

(free shipping arrived in 2 days)","Cons:Fuzzy appearance of words, constant appearance of stuck pixels","Other Thoughts:I've had to run the suggested LCD repair v2.0 website that ""Celeste"" suggested on someones review. Worked great at getting the pixels unstuck so far, but I really shouldn't be doing this once or twice a week the first couple of weeks that I've owned the monitor. Reading on it is pretty unbearable and gives me headaches if I do it for long periods of time. There is a specific spot   on the monitor that has an increased amount of fuzziness. (6 inches from left of screen all the way from the top to the bottom of the screen and is roughly 2 inches in length) Not sure if its a flaw but I don't see it when playing a movie or a game. If I wouldn't have gotten a great deal I would probably never recommend this product but I'm guessing it was on sale because of the numerous issues.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,ASUS you disappointment me!,2015-05-12,Pros:The display quality was good,Cons:HDMI was DOA -- I ended up biting the bullet and sent it back instead of just relying on the DVI. Did some web searches and apparently this is common with this LCD.,,1,2

ASUS,VE248H,3,,2015-05-06,"Pros:Decent size, very bright. Works well for what it is.","Cons:Significant ghosting, which wasn't an issue at first, but has seemed to have gotten worse. Bought two of these a few months apart, and they have different UIs, and I simply cannot get the colors to match up between them. Also, virtually not adjust-ability.","Other Thoughts:Not bad if you just need big, 1080p screens. But if you want any extras whatsoever, look elsewhere. Also, the builds are surprisingly inconsistent.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Really?,2015-05-06,Pros:None,Cons:Still cannot believe all the positive reviews. I guess mine was defective. Reached out to ASUS and they said it was my gpu or my drivers fault and to stop blaming their product. Well I have since upgraded my gpu and of course have all the latest drivers and my gaming rig far exceeds the standards of this monitor. So I bought a BenQ and it is awesome!,,0,4

ASUS,VE248H,3,Inaccurate colors after calibration,2015-05-01,Pros:- Cheap (When on sale for $129)- Speakers are a nice touch- Quick response time,Cons:- Monitor not worth it at full price- Inaccurate colors- Colors settings not consistent between monitors (dual monitors)- Calibration required if using multiple monitors,"Other Thoughts:These monitors are adequate for 90% of PC users, but for those who use their PC for photo or video editing, I would suggest you stay away. Even after calibration, these monitors still tend to favor yellows.If you're not photo or video editing, these monitors are definitely worth it when it goes on sale for $129, but at a full price of $209, there are plenty of monitors that will outperform this one.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Very solid general-use monitor,2015-04-30,"Pros:Packaging was solid.  Arrived undamaged and 2 days after ordering despite the standard 4-7 day shipping, as expected from Newegg.No dead pixels or other defects.I use this monitor for a 1st-gen MacPro and two Win7 laptops, with the included DVI-HDMI cable connected to the MacPro, and each laptop connected to the other HDMI and VGA inputs separately.  As each computer turns on or comes out of sleep/lock mode, the monitor switches to the new input.Overall picture is very good, and the monitor provides a significant increase in screen real-estate from my old 17"" 4:3 VGA monitor.Speaker quality on par with cheapish laptops, but not better than a cheap 2.1 speaker setup.","Cons:Had to turn down the brightness and contrast, it hurt my eyes at first, but I'm old, so there's that.Casing finish is glossy, my computer desk faces the middle of the room so I see the back often.  Obviously this is not a big deal, I just wish the monitor would ""blend in"" more to the dark wood in my desk area.Included DVI-HDMI cable seems to be missing some pins compared to the other DVI-D cables I've used (such as the one with my original Apple display, indicating that it may not be a real DVI-D cable), so I will be replacing it when I can find a better option.Included power cable is kind of short, I'm using the one from my old monitor as a result.Picture from the MacPro is not as good as I expected, but is still much better than my old monitor, and better than plugging directly into an HDTV of equivalent size.","Other Thoughts:I did not use the included stand at all, I mounted it directly to the VESA mount that I had already.None of the computers I have access to can really ""game"", so I have not been able to test it in that regard.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Asus 24""",2015-04-28,"Pros:Works fine, no dead pixels, decent desktop mount, nice sleek black design, very crisp and good color.","Cons:Just a tiny bit wobbly, but nothing any other monitor isn't. Other than that it's all good.","Other Thoughts:So far, so good. I read a lot of reviews before I bought this and I have no real negative comments at all...we'll see how it manages in the future since it gets a good workout on my desktop purpose built gaming machine.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good monitor,2015-04-28,"Pros:Great Size, nice and bright, decent OSD/Controls.","Cons:Occasionally, when the monitor is turned off and I turn it back on after an hour I get ""display error HDIM/DVI not connected"".

ASUS,VE248H,5,You have to be impressed.  I was,2015-04-25,"Pros:The auto adjust of the monitor was fast, and set up the monitor very well.  The colors are great, and were not washed out.  Blacks were black.  No dead pixels.  Fantastic monitor.  This is an amazing value for the dollar.","Cons:Have not found any, yet.  And, I am looking.","Other Thoughts:I bought this to replace a LG 24"" monitor that I loved.  So, I was a little leery if this one could be as good as the LG.  So far, I could not be happier.  This is one FANTASTIC monitor.  Like I said, I am trying to find something I don't like, and have not found anything so far.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Clear and Bright,2015-04-20,"Pros:These are the monitors I use at work. ASUS have been very reliable and the picture quality is great. No eyestrain, no fuzzyness. The menu gives you the ability to adjust just about everything to tweak the monitor to your liking.","Cons:My HDMI sometimes drops connection, but I don't know if is the fault of the cable or connection. The downside is that it takes about 5 seconds for the screen to reacquire the signal.","Other Thoughts:Solid build, reliable, clean and sharp screen. Customizable.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2015-04-18,Pros:By far the best moniter iv ever had and iv gone through plenty in 20yrs,Cons:Wish they came with a display port cord along with the other dvi-hdmi cord,Other Thoughts:Buy a display port cord for it and your set if your pc has it,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,2,Quality,2015-04-17,"Pros:Picture & color very good, easy to install. Offers all 3 types of input options.","Cons:Very very poor sound you have to adjust the monitor sound and the PC settings to the max just to hear a low level output.,At the 1920 X 1080 settings the picture display is about 1/4 inch to wide for the screen.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Very good monitor,2015-04-16,"Pros:Big, bright display.  Nice and sharp at 1920 resolution.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Not perfect but worth the price.,2015-04-16,"Pros:I rated this 5 eggs not because it is perfect but because it is worth the price.Screen arrived well packaged, no dead pixels.Screen brightness is fantastic, I never have it turned up all the way.Included stand provides great support while allowing the screen to be tipped.VESA mount on the back is a huge plus.Response time has been up to par.",Cons:Speakers do not put out high quality sound or good volume.Ports can be a bit annoying to get to.,"Other Thoughts:I've seen some reviews complain the screen is only 1920:1080, those are the specs given and what you bought, not sure why that is a con.Two displayports would be nice but again, it is made clear there is only 1.Color calibration wasn't spot on but pretty close, I calibrated it myself after arrival.Some people mentioned the whole screen not being used. I tried every combination of cords I could think of and the whole screen was used every time.It's not a perfect screen but it is worth the price, that said I bought it for $130 from newegg.",3,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,,2015-04-15,"Pros:Good real estate for the price. Picture is overall nice, color is a bit off.","Cons:On the right side of the screen, there's a lighter color (vertical 1in.) strip where color is just barely washed out and you can really only tell against black/darker colors. Makes little to no difference, I would spend more if I wanted a higher quality monitor.",Other Thoughts:Can't find the degaussing option.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Excellent monitor,2015-04-15,Pros:No ghostingA good amount of adjustment options3.5mm input & output for extra sound optionsLooks beautiful,"Cons:Besides 1 stuck pixel I can't get rid of, their really isn't much I can think of. Maybe the speakers but most people use headsets/external audio sources.",Other Thoughts:I bought this used locally. I got it very cheap because of a stuck red pixel in the lower left of the screen.Its so small I can barely notice. Have to really look & focus on it to notice it most of the time. I ran jscreenfix as screensaver overnight(11+hrs).The pixel is still stuck. Wish I could see about asus checking it out but since I don't have original recipt etc. I don't think they can do anything.I have registered it & the manufac date is august 2014 so its not a yr old yet.,1,0

The black outs only happen to this monitor and I saw other reviews that this happens to too, around this time frame (~1 year).",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2015-04-09,"Pros:Colors are amazing and vibrant, wonderful resolution, perfect length and height",Cons:speakers are not amazing. Rather average speakers,Other Thoughts:This was an overall wonderful monitor. I bought one and plan to purchase another to dual screen. I would recommend this to anyone. Just don't just the speakers.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Punches Above Its Weight,2015-04-04,"Pros:D-Sub, HDMI, and DVI allow me to connect this monitor to just about anything. No wall-wart...takes a standard three-wire power cord.","Cons:While the stand allows tilting, there's no height adjust. Built-in speakers (accessable only if using HDMI) are pretty wimpy. Asus could have left them out with no complaint. Monitor ships with brightness high enough to burn your retinas (turn it down for a normal looking display).","Other Thoughts:Really, for what this is selling for, you get a great basic LCD monitor with a very sharp display. Don't be looking for great sound out of the speakers, or a fancy adjustable stand. The effort here is all in the display.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Reliable and Unwavering,2015-04-04,"Pros:I've had the monitor for about 6 months and it is still doing great. Crisp, clear resolution. Instant feedback with 2ms delay. super sharp... almost too sharp.",Cons:The built in speakers are probably the only drawback. They are pretty bad.,Other Thoughts:Great monitor.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Don't go to sleep,2015-03-29,"Pros:It turns on, has no dead pixels, and the image is pretty good.","Cons:This monitor has something wrong with it when it goes to low power mode.  I have it setup as the second monitor for a dual monitor setup.  The old 24 inch ASUS monitor had NO problems.  This one is literally ruining my computer.  It seems to send the computer a signal that makes Windows constantly think the monitor is connecting and disconnecting...forever.  And Windows' way of dealing with this is eating up all possible memory (very bad for the RAM and motherboard).  If left long enough (like over night), the monitor has to have its power unplugged and then plugged back in to make it even turn back on.  It was like this out of the box, but I had it in my inventory for a month or so before needing it, so now I will have to pay shipping to get it fixed I am sure.  I have 26 ASUS monitors in my office and am now nervous to buy anymore.",Other Thoughts:Wishing I had bought a different brand/model.,0,0

Love it.Ordered the monitor at about 2pm, arrived, 2pm the next day!  regular shipping! totally blew my mind.  Thanks newegg!",Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:ASUS monitors are super durable.  Had an incident where the screen was severely scratched, and it took it like a champ.  Also can take hard physical abuse such as punching.  Unfortunately though it does have a limit.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent!,2015-03-25,"Pros:This thing looks amazing! They packaged it extremely well, simple assembly of the base, it's everything I needed in a monitor!","Cons:The speakers do sound a little bit hollow and tinny, but if you're getting a monitor like this you're likely using some real speakers anyways. The built in headphone/mic ports in the monitor pretty much negate this completely, but if you're looking for high quality audio from your monitor, this isn't it.","Other Thoughts:The audio quality was such a non-issue for me, and in my opinion most people, so I couldn't take an egg off for it. Other than that I highly recommend this monitor!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good Screen for a Good Price,2015-03-25,Pros:clearsharpfast,Cons:none,Other Thoughts:This is a good monitor that has included speakers.

I don't use the speakers for anything else since I mainly game.Lots of constant usage and this unit has remained reliable.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good Monitor,2015-03-23,"Pros:Good monitor for the price. This is my second Asus monitor, the first was purchased a few years ago and is still going strong.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor,2015-03-15,Pros:I've been using this for over 2 years now.  Color and quality is still great.  Used for gaming and occasionally watching videos.,Cons:Sound quality and loudness is terrible.  I use a headset when gaming so this doesn't really affect me but it definitely merits an egg. Also a little hard to get your cables plugged in due to their location on the monitor.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Hard to ask for more,2015-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful display.  Great resolution and colors.  No dead pixel, blur, residual images, or fading(at least not yet). The clarity would bring tears to my old monitor's eyes, which was ""1080p"", doing my new graphics card justice.","Cons:Base is a little unstable.  A little bump to the desk will make it wobble a bit, but not enough to fall over by any means. More annoying than anything, but who runs into computer desks often?","Other Thoughts:Great monitor, wonderful price. Highly recommend this, makes my EVGA Geforce GTX 970 look like it should.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Good Monitor,2015-03-14,"Pros:- Big screen. The size of the monitor is perfect. I have my tower on top of my desk to prevent a bunch of dog hair getting into the case and a 23"" monitor I had before just was dwarfed by the case. This screen is perfect and looks good from about 2 feet away.- No dead pixels. That is always good. However a lot of people have wrote that they show up after a year. Only time will tell.- Pretty solid packaging. Everything looked like it was well protected.- As far as built in speakers go, I felt they were pretty good. I haven't owned any other monitors with built in speakers but I hear everything just fine when it is turned up. But I also have no comparison to judge from.","Cons:- Being a 27"" at a 1920x1080, if you get closer than two feet, which obviously not very many people do, it does start to look a little grainy. From where I sit though, it looks good.","Other Thoughts:If you want a big monitor for a decent price, then I would recommend this one.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Good Specs BUT !!!!!!!!!,2015-03-11,"Pros:Has Very Good Spec's for the Price, I've been using mine for about 3 Months Off and On ( I have 3 Monitors ). I've probable used it equal to about 3 Full weeks, if it was the only Monitor I had.","Cons:The first time I turned it on there were about 6-9 Stuck Pixels, I just tapped on them with my fingernail and they became unstuck.  That put me on Guard, but after about 3 weeks of use I haven't seen another Stuck or Dead Pixel..","Other Thoughts:After having a few Stuck pixels the first time I turned on the monitor, ever since than when I turn on the Monitor I look for bad Pixels, I would of sent it back after the first I turned it on and had a few stuck pixels. But It comes with a 3yr, Free Shipping Both ways, so I am keeping a Close Eye on the pixels and so far it was just that initial Startup that Showed the few stuck pixels.

When monitor is plugged in using the provided HDMI to DVI cables, or even a normal HDMI to HDMI cable, the display does not fill the screen.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Great product, very impressed.",2015-03-02,"Pros:So to start, I will explain my reasoning for this monitor. My girlfriend comes over my house often, and sometimes brings her Xbox. Before, I would have to take my brothers TV if he wasn't using it. But it sucked because if she was playing, than my brother couldn't play with us. I have wanted to upgrade to a 1080p monitor for a LONG time, and finally I made the move. I play some concole games like Diablo, StarCraft, Sims, and make models on Google SketchUp, so having this nice resolution screen is gonna be great. Also with playing xbox on the monitor, I needed a monitor that had built in speakers. I would not be using those, but I needed them because I have a nice set of Bose Speakers that I needed to be able to plug in. And my speakers have a ""To The Computer"" port and an ""Aux"" port, so I can have both my computer and Xbox plugged in, and just switch the input from DVI to HDMI and the speakers will work. Very helpful. I will post another review in one week once I've had it for a while. First impressions are great!- Ordered this monitor on Friday February 27, received it on Monday, March 2. I would have gotten it a day earlier, but no one delivers on a Sunday. Very pleased with delivery time.- UPS Tracker was always up to date when i went on. Very helpful. I like to know where my stuff is, and having the tracker updated was very helpful.- The screen is amazing! A lot better than my old square format monitor.- Size is perfect for what I am going to be using it for.- The price for this monitor is really good. I shopped around before, and wanted to stick with a Dell or HP, but they are priced higher, because of the brand. Asus is getting bigger, but isn't as big as those guys. But their products are just as good if not better. I also have a Nexus 7 made by Asus, and I love that tablet.All around great product!","Cons:Honestly the only things I can think of are minor things that are NOT a deal breaker.- The stand for the monitor is a little small for the size of the screen. I wish it was a little wider just to be more secure.- Changing the input would be nice if it had a remote haha. I know that sounds lazy but it would be nice. I realize it isn't a TV, but just thought I'd throw that in there.AGAIN those points are not a make or break factor. I wouldn't take this monitor back because of that.","Other Thoughts:For the price, this monitor is a great buy. So far I have no complaints. Screen looks amazing, and is such a great upgrade from my old monitor. Very happy.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,3 Years are still great,2015-03-01,Pros:-Great picture quality-No problems for 3 years even with a number of times haling it to LAN parties-Speakers are useful in a pinch,Cons:-Speaker sound quality is not very good,Other Thoughts:I wanted a solid quality monitor with speakers so that I could bring to LAN parties without needing to break a set of speakers too. It works well and the speakers serve their purpose even though I would never use them as my primary sound setup. Surprised to see it selling 3 years later but also not surprised.,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,1,Don't expect to receive a Rebate!,2015-02-25,"Pros:I love the monitor, it was easy to setup, the display is great!","Cons:Ghosting is noticeable when gaming or surfing the web.ASUS never came through with their rebate, and there was an issue where the smart folks at ASUS placed their product sticker on the OUTSIDE of the box with information needed for their rebate program.Well guess what happened? Fedex slapped their shipping sticker right ontop of it. ASUS went ahead and accepted my rebate, and said it was sent out. I purchased this 6/17/2014, and today is 2/25/2015. Nothing was ever received.",,5,1
ASUS,VE248H,2,Short life span?,2015-02-23,"Pros:This was a reasonably priced monitor for the size and visual quality at the time.I purchased two of these on 5-02-2011 for a dual monitor configuration for a co-worker.  Around 01-25-2013 one of the monitors developed a faint grid pattern in the background.  I contacted Asus and they replaced it, as it was still within the 3 year warranty period.  That was two years ago and is still working fine (fingers crossed).Now, the second monitor I had purchased in 2011 has developed a slight flicker giving the user frequent headaches.  This one is obviously no longer under warranty.I have no gripes with Asus.  I have purchased many Asus brand monitors for our company and have had very good success with them.  It is possible that the issue could be with that particular batch or production year.  However I'm not going to take a chance and purchase another of this model.",Cons:Possible issue with this particular Asus model or production run around May 2011.,,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Terrible Bleedthrough,2015-02-21,"Pros:Once you get the monitor set to your liking, it looks good, REALLY good. Crisp, clean images and high response rate using an HDMI cable.","Cons:After about a week of owning this monitor I started noticing bleedthrough around the edges (whiter edges than the central image) - it started on black backgrounds and now, about a month and a half later, it's noticeable on everything other than white or near-white backgrounds.  If you google this monitor you'll see the bleedthrough is of epidemic proportions, which is a shame because everything else I own by ASUS is awesome.","Other Thoughts:Speakers are cheap, but serviceable.

ASUS,VE248H,4,ASUS lives up to its name.,2015-02-17,"Pros:The resolution is pretty good for the shelf age of the monitor. I purchased two of them and im running windows 8.1 and built a gaming spec PC. It runs flawlessly and the graphics are good. Honestly it wouldnt get much better than buying a 4K display. Setting up the monitor is extremely easy and no screw driver is needed. Just attach the monitor to the base and it has a screw that you can twist with your hand on the base. It comes with a VGA cable, DVI, and a long AUX cable. I was suprised it came with a AUX cable so that is a bonus if you are not running HDMI.","Cons:When I opened up one of the monitors I got, it actually had a dead pixel. I am not sure if this is a common issue but I will be keeping my eye out for anymore in the next few weeks. Also for the shelf age of these monitors they are good for there time, however if you are relying on them to be your primary source of sound I wouldnt recommend it. The volume actually is not that loud and the quality is not that great. It works fine if you are streaming shows and what not, but if you are trying to listen to music or like bass and accurate sounds while you are playing games it just is not a good choice.",Other Thoughts:Honestly I really recommend by these monitors. If I need another one soon I will be purchasing a 3rd!,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Cant figure out the speakers,2015-02-15,"Pros:Great monitor, great picture","Cons:I cannot figure out how to turn the speakers on.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Damaged upon delivery,2015-02-15,Pros:The monitor appears to be in working condition even though it was damaged during delivery or in the warehouse prior to delivery.,Cons:The box was damaged upon receipt of delivery. There was tape holding the box together where it had been dropped or crushed by something. The damage was thru the outer box and into the protective Styrofoam damaging the corner of the monitor. The monitor seems to be working however it is damaged. Some sort of discount or refund should be provided. There is a rapid 3 year replacement for this item advertised by ASUS.  Pictures were taken of the box prior to opening and examining the contents.  Pictures can be provided as proof of damage.,,0,4
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2015-02-14,Pros:Great price. The picture has stayed sharp. I have had this monitor for almost 1.5 years and it still works as well as when I bought it.,Cons:I think these larger monitors could use a little heaver and sturdier base. Another small negative that doesn't deserve to lose any points is the speakers. They are not that great but adequate for occasional audio in a office environment.,Other Thoughts:I have bought a dozen or two of the Asus brand monitors and not one employee has complained.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Awesome, but Difficult",2015-02-12,Pros:Clean and crisp. All pixels work. Decent size (not sure why you would want anything bigger). Almost all I could ask for and more for a bargain.,"Cons:Confusing button setup. Buttons don't seem to be very responsive (had to press the power button twice to get it to turn on).Unless you know a thing or two about modern monitors, the ""instructions"" that come with are little to no help. Putting it together and plugging it in a very straight forward, just setting up anything else with the buttons may not make sense to those who don't know much about video output. So I docked an egg due to lack of explanation of features.","Other Thoughts:It's a great monitor and I'm very happy with the price I got it for. It's a great size, not too big and not too small. The picture quality is amazing, colors are clear and vivid. Simple to get it put together and connected to the computer.However, I think they could have included more detailed instructions as far as the settings and features. I'm sure there's info on the web, and I may be too old-fashioned, but I like to have instructions on paper (for example - how can I troubleshoot a monitor with online instructions if the monitor isn't working?)Other than that, I would strongly reccomend this to anyone looking for a great monitor at a reasonable price. I will update my review if anything changes down the road (I've only had it for a day).",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2015-02-08,"Pros:Fantastic monitor, well worth the price paid.The screen resolution looks better than a 1080 monitor, works extremely well for gaming, and the different color modes make the biggest difference in your experience.The color modes on this monitor are actually more noticeable and more functional than modes on any other monitor I've tried.","Cons:Uses a little bit more power than advertised, but it's well worth it.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Bad LED strip,2015-02-02,"Pros:These are usually awesome monitors.  They have built-in speakers that are at least as good as those cheaper plastic desktop speakers you might have, so for an office PC with limited sound, like Internet radio, they'll suffice.  Picture quality is good, usually pretty evenly lit.  Colour quality on Standard is about as vivid as you might want for balanced colour, and sRGB is slightly dimmer but more ""correct"" colour - I usually don't bother adjusting colour components because these are good out of the box.  Auto-size works well.  Decent price (was on sale for ~$155CAD in Jan 2015 - the Canadian dollar exchange rate has gone up quite a bit and other disty's sell this for close to $180CAD).  Very clean design, and stickers come off cleanly.  HDMI cable hookup is nice - 1 cable for video AND audio.  Also includes analog audio input for DVI and VGA.","Cons:I ordered one and got one with a defective LED strip on the right side of the screen (hence the low score, otherwise I would probably rate it a strong 4).  The top few inches of the right edge weren't backlit, so I ordered a replacement.  Speakers are nothing special (see above).  Keep your subwoofer speaker set if you have one.  Piano-black plastic surfaces scratch very easily when just wiping off dust.  Does not come with an HDMI cable - WHY?!? - a manufacturer in China makes these cables for less than 1% of their retail price.  There is no good excuse for a manufacturer to not include one.",Other Thoughts:I'd like to see more manufacturers include better speakers in their monitor.  HP adds in Harman Kardon speakers in their higher-end monitors but many monitor manufacturers don't put anything good in.  At least the ASUS monitor speakers are better than those in KDS monitors - those sound a telephone earpiece.,1,2

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Asus 27"" Monitor",2015-01-24,"Pros:I have had this monitor for about a year and have not been disappointed.  I use this monitor as my primary computer display as well as my tv on the rare occasion I watch regular tv.  I have an hdmi from my verizon TV box to this monitor and a DVI from my computer to this monitor, allowing for easy switching back and forth.  The picture quality is amazing and the 2ms response time makes everything look incredible with no ghosting or blurred images or video.  And so far I have not had an ounce of trouble with this monitor.  I hope to be able to say that again in a few years.  Thanks ASUS, I am very happy with all of your products. I am looking to buy a new laptop now and would really like to make it another ASUS because all the products seem to last.","Cons:The built in speakers are pretty awful, which I guess is to be expected.  They are very small and very low power.  But it is easy enough to plug in external speakers and away you go.  I use them for watching TV once in a while and of course have separate speakers hooked up to my computer which is what I use this monitor for mostly.  I can't think of any other cons.","Other Thoughts:Good value for the money and an amazing picture.  If you want amazing sound though, you may be disappointed.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Good value and picture,2015-01-23,"Pros:1080p, nice contrast ratio and fast refresh rate for gaming.**Built in speakers work**Even better than the built in speakers... there is a headphone out jack on the back that allows a person to plugin decent PC speakers. This bypasses the tinny, no bass, low fidelity audio that pipes out of the monitor's speakers. This is no knock against the speakers on this monitor because for about $150.00 you get what you pay for.","Cons:No cons that I have encountered.If you want to use multi-monitors for gaming, these are no IPI panels with thin bevels. ASUS sells slightly better IPI monitors for about the same price point on this site.","Other Thoughts:I am using this as a second monitor for a dual monitor setup on my PC via DVI, and also as a ""TV"" for my PS4 connected via HDMI. I switch between the two with regularity.I love the audio jack out on the back of these monitors. It splits the audio from the HDMI on my PS4 to some old, but decent-sounding PC speakers with good bass. My kids use this to watch neflix, while I game on my PC, and while I game on my PS4, I can stream netflix from my computer. Great for us over-stimulated Millenials!",2,0

ASUS,VE248H,1,I would never think ASUS would do this to one of it's loyal customers.,2014-12-22,Pros:- Great Price- Great Size- Nice colors- Work for what I needed (till 5 days later),"Cons:I am a Engineering Major, so when I ordered this monitor on 11/11/2014 I assumed that it would work great for my finals, because it's all online (keep in mind my old monitor stop working). Which it did workout great till 5 days later; the screen went green on one of my finals!I assumed I could get a return/refund thru newegg mainly for the reason it left a bad taste in my mouth, but hear what happened. ASUS told me when I call them I had to go thru Newegg 30 day policy. Which made perfect sense to me, so I did. Fail to realize that the box cut out for the code was needed for a return, but I had shipped the code out on the rebate. As soon as Newegg saw I didn't have the code like a normal person would have shipped it off for the rebate asap, they sent me back a broken monitor with no refund! I try calling ASUS from their rebate department, but after calling 3 times to figure out if they can send me back the cut out of the serial number.. the line doesn't work.Has ASUS helped me with my issue yet with their product under the first month of a 3 year warranty? No. Has Newegg did anything to help me? No. And I'm truly disappointed that I have done nothing but buy buy buy from Newegg and ASUS, but when it's time for a return for a 5 days DOA. I get my broken monitor back with no refund in a legit amount of time to actually return it under warranty. I swear ASUS I can't believe your customer service is how it is in the rebate department and if I have to spend more than a week to deal with just figuring out what I can do.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Bought one as a gift for Christmas, it's THAT good!",2014-12-19,"Pros:NO GHOSTING! I keep reading there's ghosting on the screens, but maybe it's because I set my computer to turn the screen off after 5 minutes of inactivity, and I don't game for hours on end (you're supposed to take breaks every now and then, ya know). The resolution on it is fantastic, colors are really vivid, haven't had to alter any of the settings because it auto-detected. Speakers work loud enough for office work and personal gaming/movies, as I'm not trying to shake the house with it and put headphones on when I game. Can also switch between movies and gaming screen settings when switching to my blu ray player, which is nice (took some tinkering as navigating the menus was confusing, but that's normal for any new product). Only had one minor issue which will be stated in the cons.","Cons:There's no volume buttons for when you hook it up to a blu ray player.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Horrible Quality Control,2014-12-05,"Pros:- Cheap.  Well they were cheap during the holiday season at a Newegg competitor.  Just like the last three years running, the best deals were NOT to be found on this site for anything I was looking to purchase.","Cons:- Extremely poor color quality.   Like really really, mind blowingly bad.  Expect to spend hours fidgeting with terribly thought out monitor controls to reach anything remotely natural looking.- Color bleed around edges- HUGE bezels.  Not so great for multiple monitor gaming.","Other Thoughts:I'm not sure what the situation is concerning the quality control of this particular monitor.I first purchased one of these monitors about two years ago and the one I received at that time was stunning for the price range.  The colors were glorious.  Very deep blacks, very bright whites.  A little color bleed at the edges, but that's to be expected at this price range.So when these monitors went on sale for $100 each at a Newegg competitor last week,  I purchased two more for a triple monitor setup.Wow, do I feel cheated.The two new monitors look like absolute trash.  One of them has a green tinge to it that is impossible to remove.  I spent hours attempting to calibrate the colors and change settings to remove this green tinge and nothing will work.It's so bad that my wife, whose eyesight is so poor that she's legally blind, walked into the room and said ""Why is the monitor on the right so green?""Neither of the two new monitors that I received will show black tones without turning the brightness and contrast down so low that every color on the screen is muted.I've used several color calibration techniques and a couple of programs to attempt to get the two new monitors to even come close to the color clarity of the first one.Nothing works at all.  I now have three monitors sitting on my desk with the same wallpaper. The wallpaper looks different on all three.  One is slightly washed out where the black in the picture is not really true black.  One is absurdly washed out, the blacks are light grey at best and the greys are green.I am extremely disappointed.  It's two weeks into the holiday season so returning these monitors for a replacement will be an aboslute nightmare.  Not to mention I'm sure that I will have to pay the shipping costs to send two big bulky monitors back, and who knows what I'll get in return if I exchange them instead of return them.How many exchanges will I have to do in order to get two monitors that look as good as the first one I bought two years ago?By the time I add up all the shipping costs, I might as well have just bought the BenQ that I wanted in the first place and never had to worry about washed out, greenish tinged colors.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,No Major Problems,2014-12-04,"Pros:I bought one of these for my wife for Christmas last year (2013). We had the usual reported problem of that time where it would black out for a second or two and then come back on. But it seemed to go away after the monitor warmed up a bit. Have had no problems with color, ghosting, or dead pixels. Overall, very nice and large display. My wife uses it daily and has never complained which is good.","Cons:Occasional momentary blackout when the monitor is cold (and when it was new), although this problem seems to have gone away completely over the last six months or so.","Other Thoughts:I am seriously considering purchasing another one of these because the price now is about half of what it was a year ago. No monitor is perfect but this one is pretty darn close. I have had good luck with all Asus products that I have purchased and am also considering purchasing one of their system boards to build yet another system. And just FYI, Newegg is my favorite place to shop for computer parts.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Disappointing Defects,2014-12-04,Pros:Physically looks identical to the DVI version of this monitor (which I own and like).No dead pixels.,"Cons:1st issue was a washed-out look; blacks were grey and overall it just looked desaturated. I played with settings to no avail. I found some comments online blaming the HDMI, saying that it is defaulting to RGB (correctly) but that the HDMI only works properly in CMYK mode. I switched this in my Nvidia Control Panel and boom, perfect picture. 3 hours killed right there.2nd issue was that my power button stopped working, and all the other buttons now behave like a power-button. Menu turns it on and off, up and down do the same, etc. Power button = nothing.3rd issue is that it periodically loses power/connectivity. There appears to be no physical trigger for it, just random. I'll just be browsing and boom, black screen. Or I'll turn it on to nothing.Frustrating and disappointing. I will not be buying any more monitors that don't have at least one DVI port.","Other Thoughts:2-eggs instead of 1 because I think this is an isolated issue with this individual monitor, rather than a brand issue. My other DVI version of this same monitor is great.",5,1

The ports are tucked in a way that make plugging the cords in annoying. No big complains though.","Other Thoughts:The base seems cheap while putting it together, but seem to work well enough.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Legit monitor,2014-12-03,"Pros:This monitor looks great. I had 3 23"" Acer IPS displays before. They had better viewing angles but the colors and picture did not look nearly as good as this monitor. The 27"" with 1080 might be weird for some but for me I think it's fine. I don't notice any crazy pixelation or anything. It has 100x100 VESA mounts and also has 2 HDMI ports.",Cons:It would be cool to be able to adjust the height but you can do whatever if you get VESA mounts.

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2014-12-02,"Pros:Good for gaming.  It's large enough for me.  Full HD and speakers.  I normally use a headset but it's nice to have that option without an extra set of speakers.  It's ASUS, they know a thing or two about computer hardware -- and gaming.  Great price!","Cons:It's not 30"".  But if I wanted to pay for 30"" I would buy one.",Other Thoughts:It's a monitor.

Tried various consoles and different HDMI chords. Nothing. Registers there's an HDMI connection however its just black with occasional flashes of the screen grayed out and covered in a red static.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2014-11-28,"Pros:I am enjoying this monitor, I have a MacBook Pro, PS4 and an Old IBM Think pad hooked up to it. When I am on my MacBook Pro, I can use the screens PIP feature to work with my Old Thinkpad at the same time. PIP only works for VGA and Display Port only. It is worth the price compared to other monitors. The speakers are ok for light use, make sure your sound isn't bass heavy otherwise the sound will come out weird. The HDMI does transfer the sound through to the monitor. The resolution is alright, it is as good as my MacBook Pro (Late 2011). So far no complaints. Great monitor for gaming.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Decent Bang for the Buck,2014-11-26,Pros:Good looking display at a great price. 3 year warranty.  Relatively simple to operate.,"Cons:The ASUS documentation for the VE247H is a bit sketchy.  The unit's OSD firmware had a number of parameters that are not discussed in the manual.  These ommisions leave the user to ""hack"" his/her way through a proper set up.I found the default display modes' settings to be barely in the ballpark.  You will have to spend time with the brightness/contrast/saturation to really get it to look right.  Yes, a certain amount of tweaking is to be expected on any color display, but it seemed to me that ASUS failed to bring the pre-sets into close enough proximity to what is really practical and usuable.For lack of complete documentation and marginal presets, -1 egg.","Other Thoughts:I am still working with my color/contrast settings, but if you can get this monitor for the right price, I would say it is worth the time.  I have my ""Splendid"" Standard Mode settings looking good...  this may help others:ASUS OSD ""Splendid"" Standard Mode SettingsBrightness:  85Contrast:      70Color Temp:  User Mode (all colors 100%)Smart View:  OffIn all of the various modes, you will want to look at various color saturation and brightness/contrast ratios that best suit your viewing environment.

Great response rate.,Cons:As soon as I plugged in the monitor I noticed it looked super washed out compared to my old Asus monitor. It took a while to dial in the settings to get them to look decent. I noticed when I was playing a game  and it called for almost all black and dark gray loading up that there was what looked like a white box in the middle of the screen. Like everything was a shade or 2 lighter than everywhere else. It lookes like something was sat on the screen and it was damaged.,Other Thoughts:This is my second Asus monitor that I've had to send back to get one that was correct.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Exceptional,2014-11-22,Pros:Just purchased two monitors for my home office. I can't judge how these will perform over time yet but out of the box they look fantastic.

Truly happy that I ran across these during my research.,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Newegg will be my new first place to look when shopping on-line.

Took a chance with the first, bought second one after first arrived - very satisfied. Clean, clear and no ghosting.","Cons:Menu - takes time to figure it out. Controls are easy, but as another reviewer said difficult to view the light gray control tags on the monitor. Base is round and offers fair stability, tilt front to back is standard. Base offers NO height adjustment, NO rotation capability. If you want that you'll need to purchase a dedicated dual monitor stand.","Other Thoughts:(Geeze these are cheap - 109 after rebate!), couldn't be more satisfied. Dual monitors this size running side by side offers a good amount of real estate. Running at max display and enjoying the productivity!",0,0

I remember i paid 160 plus they had a mail in rebate for 20$ so the total would've been 140 but i never mailed the rebate... The reason they do mail in rebates is because alot of people will never do it...

ASUS,VE248H,3,Average performance at decent price,2014-11-15,Pros:- The monitor is a decent value at its price (got it on sale here).,"Cons:- I bought this monitor because of the built-in speakers and the decent size. My expectations were low since built-in speakers are almost always subpar, but these speakers are extremely underwhelming. The overall volume is low, and the sound quality is REALLY poor. Not making this mistake again.- The preset color settings are atrocious. They are very poorly configured. You will need to follow other users' posted settings to get a decent picture quality.- Somehow this 23.6"" looks a lot smaller than other 24"" monitors.",,1,0

I would say to spend the extra $50 on the 24 inch 144hz monitor if you first of all are primary pc and dont care for the extra 3 inches of space. And if you are looking for a 2nd monitor for just using it for media and your primary monitor for gaming i would reccomend this. Im going to be upgrading to the benq xl2720z 144gz monitor.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Ghosting? Not really.,2014-11-13,"Pros:I have been using this monitor for about six months, I haven't had a single issue with ghosting, dead pixels or anything of the sort. It's a nice clean monitor, color is nice with a bit of tweaking, the matte finish of the screen helps minimize reflections and smudges. All around an excellent monitor, the MIR was nice too. The bezeled edge is nice, it's a good looking monitor.","Cons:The sound is not great, but I didn't really expect anything else, the symbols above the buttons are nearly impossible to read unless you are shining light directly on them. I'm not sure why they are a dull silver, but that isn't a major knock, simply because it is also nice to not have any sort of distraction on the monitor, but I also would like to be able to see what they do without the help of a flashlight. There is a middle ground in there somewhere, that's all I'm really trying to say.","Other Thoughts:If you're having issues with ghosting yours is defective, you need to return it if you can, same with dead pixels.

I've contacted Asus and they told me they'll do something about this. It's been a week.IN ALL SERIOUSNESS: The speakers aren't exactly high quality, but I'm not an enthusiast when it comes to audio. Also, the color and brightness settings were a bit too much, but thanks to a few minutes on the internet (and another few minutes scrolling through these reviews) I managed to put it on a setting that looks just right. Not enough for me to take an egg off seeing as this was a problem I fixed myself.","Other Thoughts:If you can, get two monitors. 'Nuff said.",0,0

One day I was messing with cables and the monitor stopped working altogether. I found that the cable connector hadn't been tightened. Be sure to do that, as it fixed the issue perfectly. Dah ... The only negative thing I have to say is that I can't find a monitor driver. Windows uses the generic PnP driver, and I can't find a specific driver for this monitor, and none was shipped. I assume the PnP driver from Microsoft is good enough. Also, you need the NVIDIA software package, at least for multiple monitors. Don't know about a single monitor.

Makes similar sounds when your character dies in Contra, but on repeat.Not enough for me to take out an egg only because it's still a 27"" Full HD LED monitor, which is the main reason why I bought it for, not for it's inability to produce clean sound.That's what my computer speakers are for.","Other Thoughts:Regarding the sound going haywire when it's connected to a PS3 when playing certain games, it's a bit of a disappointment because it's one feature that doesn't work well and when it's offered on an item you bought, you do wish it worked well. That's not enough for me to be disappointed overall with the monitor because I bought it for the monitor, the resolution, size, the Full HD, and the 2MS feature.

The integrated speakers are nothing fancy but do the job for my application.  I've owned several Asus monitors over several years and have always been happy with their quality and price.,0,0

I actually no longer watch TV partly because the picture on this monitor is better (granted I have an older TV)Colors are great and set up is easy as 1,2,3.  Just plug and play.","Cons:Purchased this monitor because of the included speakers, over the cheaper (non speaker) version.  Quite frankly, the speakers suck.  If its a completely silent room you'll probably be fine, but with volume on full I could barely hear over my central air system.  Any background noise will impact the sound greatly.

I have NIVIDIA graphics card though and have used HDMI to connect to the screen but still the  picture quality is not astonishing as it sounded in some review . NO dead pixel on Arival  as of yet . Will update review at one yr and then will see .why 4 star , because of the price and connectivity but poor picture qualityin All it works as a good monitor if you are looking for cheap stand alone tv as you can connect apple tv and or a chrome cast or any other media streaming box and then take the audio out to your portabel speaker and there you go $119 cheap led 23 inch stand alone tv",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,So far it's great!,2014-09-24,"Pros:Placing this next to my 5 year old Acer 22"" 720 makes this Asus a Beast!! Nvidia Control Panel recognized it easy and running it side by side - dual monitor display with the 720 monitor is nice as the 1080 HD stays on the Asus so there is no compromise having both up at the same time.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Satisfied,2014-09-22,"Pros:Great value, excellent picture quality! The ports face the bottom of the screen and don't face out the back directly, which is something I looked for in a monitor. I feel like it strains the cables and ports less being bottom loaded. No dead pixels on delivery!","Cons:VGA, DVI and power cable are very short. If your monitor is far away from your desktop like mine is, it might be a problem for you.  Luckily I had some older cables to use.",Other Thoughts:Didn't test or use the speakers. I upgraded from a square 4:3 monitor to this and couldn't be happier!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor for a great price!,2014-09-21,"Pros:- Beautiful display (once you get it dialed in correctly; more on this later)- VGA, DVI-D, and HDMI inputs!","Cons:- The built-in color presets are just awful.  I wouldn't suggest using any of these as they come configured.  I was frustraighted with the look of this monitor the way it comes out of the box and was on the fence about returning this monitor, in all color presets it was just WAY to bright / blown out.  LOTS of tweeking later, and I've got it looking the way I prefer.","Other Thoughts:Here's my settings that I use: (connected via HDMI to MSI N660TI PE 2GD5/OC GeForce GTX 660 Ti)SPLENDID -Scenery ModeCOLOR -Brightness - 30Contrast - 70Saturation - 35Color Temp. - WarmSkin Tone - NaturalSmart View - OFFIMAGE -Sharpness - 0Trace Free - 40Aspect Control - FullASCR - OFFSYSTEM SETUP -ECO Mode - OFFAgain, these are the setting that work for me... this might give you a good starting point to tailor this monitor to your viewing taste.  DON'T SEND IT BACK!  It's a great monitor once you have it dialed in correctly!P.S.I don't use the built-in speakers... I feel that those are just about as useless as the built-in speakers on an LCD / Plasma TV.  They're never going to be like a good 2.1 or 5.1 system... I'd say skip 'em.",4,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Perfect.,2014-09-20,"Pros:Vibrant, no dead pixels, plenty large enough for the average gamer. Anything bigger at 1080p looks washes out. This is the perfect monitor.",Cons:No HDMI cable. Had to run to the store. Not worth taking an egg off cus I should have read instead of assume.,,3,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Buy this monitor while on sale.,2014-09-19,"Pros:-Very decent picture clarity and great color depth (read 'cons' and 'other thoughts')-Desirable response time for HD video and gaming-All standard ports, easy cable management, good looking-Price point (on sale for almost half off!)-Zero dead pixels on arrival-Speakers(?) - others say that they can't even hear them, but i need to keep mine at 50% volume to not be too loud.-Did I mention that with the rebate you can get this for real darn cheap right now?1080p/2ms/~24in. (perfect size for gaming) = really good deal.","Cons:-Like other reviewers have mentioned, out of the box mode presets are atrocious-Very clumsy menu buttons and OSD (no big surprise)-Documentation that comes with monitor is useless-Glossy black plastic is a fingerprint-magnet-No included HDMI cord (they are so cheap right now, why not?)-Speakers kind of a joke because they are hidden behind the monitor which, unless you have it backed up to a flat surface to reflect the sound, lose stereo definition... no crisp left-right sounds but would be interesting to cut off a mono plug eventually to use as a center and see how that works","Other Thoughts:Not a bad option at all - if I was doing a mutli-monitor setup I would grab two more of these at this price.  That said, they do take a lot of configuration tweaking to get right.  Hours.  With which, once they are set, you have a great-looking picture with amazing response time.  Worth it, to me, at such a low price.Just please, please don't do what another reviewer suggested and send it back after one day.  Calibration and configuration is a two part deal:  The monitor's own settings will never fix everything.  That is why you have options on your display adapter.  Working the options of your specific display adapter in-line with the monitor settings is a must if you want to calibrate color to your liking.  Give it some time.  I've had this less than a week now and it is preset to have a high-detail, high-gamma game mode; a higher-contrast, rich-color movie mode; and a true color photo-editing mode.  All I need for a nice low price.I will update this review after a longer period of ownership but my first response is very positive.  If you are on the fence, buy it and see.Oh, and, Newegg: you guys always surprise me.  Regular old, free shipping and I still got it in 48hrs.  Cheers.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Not quite 5 eggs,2014-09-15,"Pros:Good product, no bad pixels and a good selection of inputs. I had the display since May and am very pleased with it.",Cons:I have the display attached to my APC backup since I don't have an outlet on the power supply in the computer. By the time  the APC runs through checking the battery at start-up the monitor is in standby. I don't power up the computer until the APC comes up on household current. It is annoying that I have to take the display out of standby all the time to see what is happening on the screen.,"Other Thoughts:""Good product but they nit picked about the rebate information and rejected my rebate.They think they need an extra $20.00 more than customer good will and they lost a customer. I won't buy any ASUS product again.......""",1,5
ASUS,VE248H,4,Excellent Monitor; but...,2014-09-14,Pros:Stunning contrast and color and highly 'tweakable' for personal color hue.  Specs are as advertised save for the sound wattage plus the monitor will tilt much farther forward than listed..  At the current promo price this and the 248 series are outstanding values.  Gamers will especially appreciate the 2msRR.  I detect '0' blurring in sports action.  As usual Newegg delivers as advertised: quickly.  I highly recommend this monitor notwithstanding the below cons.,"Cons:Sound system is so marginal that it should not be mentioned as a feature.  At 100% db you will need to ask your next door neighbors to quiet down so that you can hear any softer music passages.  Do not buy this unit for its speakers; whatever add-on speakers you own are superior.  I believe the wattage rating to NOT be RMS.  The umpteen language 'Quick Start' guide is a true non-masterpiece.  Monitor electronic controls are not intuitive and some buttons (5 total) have unlisted dual purpose.  IE:  the brightness button also applies to sound (increase) when the sound menu is engaged.  For those familiar with Asus, this may be a non-issue; however, as this was my initial buy of this genre my learning curve was tested, more than a little.",Other Thoughts:Buy it.   Top value.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Absolutely Great,2014-09-13,"Pros:Great looking, clear-as-crystal display with great presets for different activities. It also just looks great, very sleek. I absolutely love this monitor,","Cons:Tech wise, nothing! It shipped fast with out any damages or issues. My main problem is that the price hopped up so much.I bought this monitor last year for $130. I came to order another one last week and saw the price had jumped to $150. I held off to shop around and save a bit more and now it has jumped another $20.","Other Thoughts:For me, this monitor's biggest perk was its price which was $40 cheaper than it is now. Im not sure if prices go up based on popularity but the $20 increase trend that seems to be happening is pretty much making this item less and less worth the purchase - You could more than likely find something better for its current price tag.Its a shame, I was more than ready to buy another.",0,0

Be it Excel, Netflix, gaming, or even simple computer upkeep, these monitors (Bought two thinking they were a steal for the price) were ghosting fiends. I couldn't handle it how upsetting it was to see that. I even tried multiple computers with different graphics cards and motherboard manufacturers.",Other Thoughts:RMA sent in.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2014-09-10,"Pros:Purchased this for a customer and I have to say, I was a bit jealous. Beautiful display, nice appeal, good build quality. It's bright and the colors are nice as well.",Cons:None as of yet.,,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Good monitor,2014-09-06,"Pros:Bought this monitor to replace an old 19inch CRT that died.  This monitor is installed in a 2 monitor setup on the same computer.No dead pixels that I can see.Very nice resolution.More than enough room to work on the single monitor. When opening Word, there is enough room for 2 pages side by side, unlike with my 19inch LCD.This is a good monitor.","Cons:Two cons:The DVI cable is shorter than I expected.  Its roughly 4feet 6inches long and almost didnt make it to where I have my PC sitting.  A 6 foot DVI cable would have been nice.The monitor does not come with a HDMI cable.  I didnt need the HDMI cable however, others may.Neither of these were enough to knock and egg off the rating for me.","Other Thoughts:As others have said, this monitor does not come with an HDMI cable.  You will have to buy one if that is what you want.  It does come with a DVI and a VGA cable.Tip:If you are installing this on a 2 monitor setup and are moving your previous #1 monitor to be the #2 monitor:Turn off the PC, unplug old monitor, plug in this new monitor only, turn on PC.This allows windows to see the new monitor as monitor #1.  Afterwards feel free to plug in your old monitor and windows should recognize it as #2 without any trouble.If you dont do this, you may have some trouble with windows still recognizing your old monitor as monitor #1 and you will have to play with the software setting in windows, which is a pain.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,3 month review,2014-08-30,"Pros:I previously reviewed this monitor as being 5 stars and I am still very satisfied with the monitor and it's overall operation.  However, I have identified one deficiency that irritates me to no end about the monitor as I have spelled out in the cons section which has caused me to rethink the 5 stars and reduce the original review to 4 stars.",Cons:The power LED is next to impossible to see from the front of the monitor.  You have to lean over to see if the monitor is turned on or off.  At first I was thinking that the power switch was flaky because at times I would have to press the switch twice or more to turn on the monitor.  What was really happening was that I had left the monitor on from my previous session so when I thought I was turning it on I was really turning it off.  Then I would have to press it again to turn the monitor on.  The power indicator needs to either be placed on the front of the monitor or have a design change so that it is visible from the front.,"Other Thoughts:I am still very pleased with the monitor and for the price I paid I would certainly buy it again.  As it is you either have to lean way over to see if it is on or off or you have to place a mirror on your desktop to see if the light is on.  Perhaps the ASUS representatives will see this review and refer my comments to their design depart so this design flaw, in a otherwise perfect product, can be corrected.",1,3

ASUS,VE248H,4,Early impressions,2014-08-29,"Pros:Pleased with this in the first days.  Clear, sharp image.  No bad pixels.  Easy setup.  Stand does not wobble on a sturdy desk.  DVI-to-HDMI cable included.  Brightness, contrast, other visual characteristics are fine (see disclaimer below).  No splotchiness, lighting is even.","Cons:For me this replaces an older ASUS which was 1920 x 1200 (16 x 10 rather than 16 x 9).  Unfortunately that  ratio is no longer available - I miss those 230K pixels.Controls are poorly labeled, and inputs are in awkward positions to attach cables to, but those things are true of every monitor I've ever seen.","Other Thoughts:Haven't tried the speakers.  Colors seem correct but I have not considered this very closely, as it is not critical for me - if you need high accuracy for your work, find out more.This and VE278Q seem to be very similar variants of the model, but this cost less and some of the specs are better.",1,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,Best thing since sliced bread.,2014-08-29,"Pros:Seeing as i was using a 19"" CRT monitor(VGA connection) since pretty much the stone age, going to this product has blown my mind.Im a avid movie watcher, gamer and photographer and this has blown new life into pretty much everything i do.Games are a whole new level of awesome.Movies are sharp and clear.Photographs are easier to edit and get a more ""pure"" image.Quick and easy switch to the preset color profiles(Scenery, Gaming, etc etc).Screen is clear, bright, crisp and had no dead pixels.PiP...people still use this?Overall this product is awesome.","Cons:I gave 5 stars as the quality of the product is superb. If the following mattered to me personally i would of docked an egg.1) Install directions(I.E. Manual). 3 sentences in english. Although im pretty sure it had every possible written and spoken language that this planet has to offer included on the manual.2) Tilt. I was afraid to adjust the tilt(forward and backwards) as it was fairly ""tight"" and didnt want to break the base with the force to change it. There were no clear instructions as to where and how to adjust it.3)Speakers. While a bonus that these are even included, they are so insignificant its equivalent to calling your friend on 2 cups connected by a string.4)No inherent screen size adjustment. Took me a good 15 minutes scrolling through every menu option before i realized you cannot change or adjust the screen size(to fill the monitor). Finally figured out i had to go into my ATI interface and adjust the overscan to fill the entire screen with a picture.5) No height adjustments. I had to lower my chair so low to the ground i ended up just sitting on top of some pillows so i was eye level with the monitor. Perfect if you are a ""little person"" though.6) It doesnt come with a mail order bride, a money tree or a spaceship.",,2,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,My Third one,2014-08-12,Pros:Great Monitor! No dead pixels,Cons:none really to speak of.one tiny little con perhaps.... The bezel could be a bit thinner.,"Other Thoughts:This is my third Monitor to round out my surround set up. All three monitors are the same model Asus. I've bought them about a year apart and I can say they perform very well. I've seen reports of people having issues but, I have none and they perform flawlessly.",2,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great purchase,2014-08-11,"Pros:Crisp image, solid size, even pretty good sound for built in speakers.",Cons:None as of this moment.,Other Thoughts:I haven't had any issues that some of the other reviewers have had. Everything is as it should be. I highly recommend this monitor.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Satisfied,2014-08-09,"Pros:Lasted with no problems since 3/2011, screen is super bright, tilts up and down, stand is kind of sort, had to stack it on top of books to keep it head level. I used it for gaming (didn't want to buy a TV because it was too big/expensive at the time). Great picture for gaming or normal use. I no longer game, so I use it now because my 14 inch laptop has a tiny screen, so I just hook it up to this.",Cons:Speakers are terrible - not a big surprise here.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome,2014-08-07,"Pros:Awesome monitor, it's much better than the S22B150 I had been using.   I should have bought two of these.   Great buy.Really bright and even back light all around.   What an improvement I've made.",Cons:None,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Monitor review,2014-08-06,"Pros:Screen looks great.Decent screen size.Supports DVI, VGA, and HDMI.Has built in speakers.2ms response.Setup/assembly was easy.Comes with all video cables (exept hdmi)","Cons:Stand is very short so there is little room from table to bottom of monitor in my opinion. Also you can't adjust the monitor to make it taller you can only tilt it forward or back. You might feel the need to place a book underneath to raise it, or just lower your chair.The built in speakers are a joke, they work but if your going to be watching movies or listening to music I would recommend investing in external speakers with better quality.","Other Thoughts:I have purchased three of these so far to complete my own setup and they work great all together, with the tripple monitor stand I purchased separately got rid of the hight issue.I noticed that using the HDMI over the DVI produces a slightly dimmer screen but it's barely noticeable.Also if you choose to use the built in speakers+HDMI the audio can be setup through the hdmi cable so no need for a aux cable.Overall the quality of monitor for the price is not bad, I would probably buy it again if I needed another screen.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2014-08-06,Pros:Great Quality for the price,"Cons:Sound quality of speakers isn't that great, but I used a program to increase the fidelity and it helped a little.",Other Thoughts:The speakers are at least as loud as my laptops,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,fairly satisfied,2014-08-05,"Pros:looks great, item is as described",Cons:taking an egg off because the power connection is loose. It will fall out if you move the monitor or touch the power cord near the connection. not a fan of the stand either but i knew it wasn't gonna be great when I ordered itvideo cables that came with it were a little short for my setup,Other Thoughts:grab some electrical tape to keep the power cable inunless you like your monitors an inch off the table get a different stand/mount or a riser,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,,2014-08-04,"Pros:cheap, large screen.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Update to: Yellowish tainting of blue gradients,2014-08-04,"Pros:Large screen, crisp display, vibrant colors, decent response time, options to reduce ghosting and corona motion effects, decent viewing angle.","Cons:In Scenery Mode, Blue gradients towards the lighter end of the spectrum have a yellowish tainting to it. (Fixed issue!)","Other Thoughts:This is an update to my review below, as Newegg doesn't allow review edits to reflect an updated situation.Asus tech support has been very helpful and friendly to help me get my discoloration issue troubleshooted, and though they weren't able to find precise technical settings, they did find something that helped me determine the cause. I'll quote below:–Standard Mode: allows you to view documents and browse websites comfortably with optimized colors and contrast.–Game mode: adaptively brings up dark, hard-to-see areas while leaving the well-lit areas untouched—allowing you to see your enemies lurking in dark corners without washing out the colors as a whole.–Theater mode: simulates a theater experience by enhancing the contrast and color saturation of the image—delivering livelier and more vivid visuals for greater immersion.–Scenery mode: increases the brightness range, introduces more contrast gradations and selectively tweaks the color saturation of key elements such as blue skies and green fields to make for more captivating land and seascapes—keeping your photos as fresh and vivid as when you were actually there.–Night View mode: breathes the beauty back into night vistas by smartly raising the Y-Luminance signal to highlight poorly-lit details—capturing the scene’s beauty in crisp and vibrant fashion.I was using Scenery Mode, and I imagine it's this selective tweaking of blues and greens that was causing this to occur. In photos and movies it might be okay, but for digital imaging and anything involving gradients, it was the likeliest source of discoloration for that hue range.What I am using now is Theater mode with the saturation adjusted hardware-side while calibrating the monitor, and so far so good.Note, for anyone doing similar calibrations, you need to actually power the monitor off to save your settings. I lost my settings when I rebooted the computer and got confused when I landed back in Scenery Mode.Between this review and my previous, the score now is around 3.5 eggs. It would be a full 4, but the frustrations of this experience docks it slightly, and not everyone is going to have the patience or expertise to troubleshoot this if they experience a similar issue.But at least all is good for me now. And again, Asus support does their best to be helpful, so they are to be commended for that.",1,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great,2014-08-04,Pros:Great Build QualityGreat ContrastGreat Panel-Image QualityGreat Price,"Cons:Mine arrived with one dead pixel, but RMA requires at least three.","Other Thoughts:So great I just purchased a second one. Hopefully it arrives with no dead pixels so I can use it as my main. If it does, I am going to flip some tables.+1 would recommend to anyone.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good monitor for a good price,2014-08-02,Pros:Multiple input options. Very sturdy base. Can have a very nice picture after some adjustments.,"Cons:SUPER bright and washed out right out of the box. Still trying to tweak things here and there to get the image the way it should be. I shouldn't have to spend more than 10 minutes calibrating a monitor, but I've been putting in 10 minutes each day trying to get it better. My old Samsung was perfect right out of the box, so it is possible.Almost no documentation on what different settings do.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend turning off the Smart View, as that was the biggest contributor to everything being washed out. Unfortunately, the minute documentation doesn't describe this ""feature"", so I don't know what it's intended purpose actually is.It is a good monitor after you spend some time with it. Use the windows Calibrate Color tool under your display options after you disable the ""Smart View"" feature on the monitor. This should get you really close to real capabilities of the monitor.",4,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,looks good,2014-08-01,Pros:no dead pixels. great looking colors and quality,Cons:speakers are terrible,"Other Thoughts:i switch between my headphones and the speakers with my creative soundblaster card and the speakers that are built into this monitor are very quiet. I can barley hear them. But that is ok because I use headphones most the time, but its nice to have speakers every once in a while.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Yellowish tainting of blue gradients,2014-07-31,"Pros:Large screen, crisp display, vibrant colors, decent response time, options to reduce ghosting and corona motion effects, decent viewing angle.With the exceptions noted below, this is a beautiful monitor.",Cons:Blue gradients towards the lighter end of the spectrum have a yellowish tainting to it. (see below),"Other Thoughts:My monitor also has about a 2x2 pixel area about where the start menu is located that appears to be a speck of dust trapped between the lcd and protective screen (it's not dead or stuck pixels, I confirmed it with a jeweler's loupe). Because of its location, it is not a distraction, but if it were located anywhere else I would probably have RMA'd this monitor immediately.The major disappointment with this monitor is the issue I am having with color accuracy. I use this monitor for gaming, but also for graphics work, so when I discovered an odd yellow ""taint"" to certain blue gradients, I was very unhappy.I am able to mitigate this issue by using my video driver software to LOWER saturation levels, and the monitor menu options to RAISE saturation levels until they are balanced and the taint is gone.Because of this, at first I believed the issue to be on my video card's end. However, I recently plugged in a Raspberry Pi with XBMC installed, and the blue background on it also suffers from this yellowish ""taint,"" leading me to believe it is some issue with the monitor itself somehow.I would love to know the precise cause of this, and if there is something I can do to eliminate the issue permanently. Until then, whenever I see it happening, I will have to adjust my saturation levels and hope that it doesn't impact my graphics editing too heavily.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Its a pretty good display,2014-07-31,Pros:Its crisp it clean and it bright. So fae no dead pixles or artifact or ghosting. It relatively cheap.,"Cons:In standard mode the color is a little washed out, that is because it utilizing the true 2ms response time. Set in theater mode the colors are brilliant but the response time goes to about 5 ms which in reality is insignificant but all the times add up when gaming.",,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,I had high hopes for this monitor,2014-07-28,Pros:Big screenGood response timeGreat price,"Cons:After about 3 weeks of use, I turned it on one day and found a nice little red pixel in the middle of the screen. After a couple days of trying to fix the stuck pixel nothing worked, so I sent it out for a replacement.I got my replacement today and was happy to see about 9-10 white stuck pixels!","Other Thoughts:I'm definitely not going to get a replacement again or buy a monitor from Asus ever again. Debating on getting a refund or just keeping it since the dead pixels are far to the left and out of the way, not TOO noticeable but I still would never buy a monitor with dead pixels.",3,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great view,2014-07-28,"Pros:The view is beautiful on this screen.  Easy set up and installation, attaches to my dual monitor stand with ease.","Cons:When I tried to use the stand that came with the monitor, the tilt was locked in a down position.  The tilt is the reason I bought this particular monitor.",,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2014-07-26,Pros:Great monitor. 2ms frames cannot be matched for the price. It has all the gadgets and add-ons that you would want and need.,Cons:Had a hard time with the audio only coming up through the monitor speakers. I have a logitec surround sound that wouldn't work through the PC plug-in. I had to plug it in through the monitor.,,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Spectacular.,2014-07-23,"Pros:The contrast. That most definately defines this display. I have a two-monitor setup and one of them is this monitor and the other is slightly different, but it only has a 10000000:1 ratio which is lengths below this one.I can honestly say that the contrast ratio is what makes games look so amazing on ultra settings. I can notice the difference between the graphics on the two monitors and I guess the difference in colors makes such a profound impact...","Cons:Nothing really, I suppose if you want to have integrated sound, then this model isn't spectacular for that, but that's only hearsay because I have separate speakers.",Other Thoughts:I definately reccomend this product to anyone that loves amazing graphics and spectacular colors.,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Terrible Customer Suypport,2014-07-23,Pros:It worked good for 5 months. Then the bleed on screen that happened which turned into a huge blob lower right and a day later the top part of the screen got a purple blob.RMA USDA460520,Cons:Dead after 5 months. Screen runs very hot which may be the problem.,"Other Thoughts:Do not, I repeat do not call customer support after business hours or you will get some one who is very unknowledgeable about your issue and has no clue as to treat customers almost as if they don't care.. Because of my many issues with customer care and how long this product lasted I will never recommend or buy another Asus product in my life and I have bought everything from monitors, laptops, motherboards and graphics cards. When a huge company such as Asus outsources calls overseas that means they are money hungry and could care less about their own products or customers. I make it a habit to not buy from companies who outsource calls and take away from the system of employment.",2,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,seems like a great deal,2014-07-22,"Pros:Looks fantastic, feels instant and has great range of color. Works with a ps3 just as well as a TV might",Cons:Had a dead pixel within an hour of out of the box.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Good basic monitor,2014-07-22,"Pros:DVI, VGA and HDMIcolors pretty vivid","Cons:a little light bleed, maybe a little too bright on default settings.",Other Thoughts:got for for <$100 - and it held up,2,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome monitor,2014-07-19,"Pros:The screen's finish is fingerprint proof and somewhat scratch proof. With its 24 inches diagonal size, it's plenty large enough to replace aging medium sized TVs as long as you have an adapter for analog devices. It arrived intact with no sighns of dead pixels. Its price to performance ratio is difficult to match. Even when 4K monitors become mainstream this monitor will serve nicely as a secondary display. Makes my laptop feel like a desktop.",Cons:Doesn't have a Display Port interface(although hdmi is much more universal). It's rather basic and lacks features of similar monitors and as such has relatively few input ports making it less than optimal to be used in leu of an HDTV,"Other Thoughts:Due to it's budget friendly cost, it easily fits onto any budget computer build and on up into the midrange computer builds.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Get the VE278H instead.,2014-07-19,"Pros:This is a great monitor, it's nice and big and has great resolution. It's also a very sturdy monitor, which is important because of it's size.","Cons:I bought this monitor initially with my setup, but I wanted another monitor later so I got the VE278H (this is VE278Q). I didn't see any differences and it was cheaper so I got that. Ugh, but I didn't see the contrast ratios. The contrast ratio on this monitor is only 10000000:1, and the VE278H is 50000000:1- this makes a HUGE difference when using a dual monitor setup. The VE278H makes everything look so much sharper than this one just because of contrast. So please, get the VE278H it's cheaper and better. The only difference between the two is price and contrast but that makes a big difference.","Other Thoughts:DON'T GET THE VE278Q, GET THE VE278H. IT'S BETTER AND CHEAPER.",2,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great All-Around Monitor,2014-07-19,"Pros:Handles pretty much any kind of input: HDMI, DisplayPort, VGA, & DVI (w/ included adapter).  Has built-in speakers.  No bad pixels.  Fast response time. VESA mount.  3-Year Warranty.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Nice monitor and display looks great.  More than enough brightness to satisfy anyone.  It's nice that the built-in stand doesn't use the VESA mount, so you can attach small computers (i.e. intel NUC) to the back of the monitor while still using the included stand.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Solid Monitor,2014-07-15,Pros:Great monitor with great color.  Nice picture at the price point.,"Cons:Switch sometimes takes a while.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Monitor speakers will never be perfected.,2014-07-12,"Pros:Base doesn't jiggle about unless you shake the desk very hard. Monitor Controls are oriented differently than I'm used to but once you read the manual and figure out what they do, it's cake. Resolution and refresh rates are as good as I expected brightness and color is excellent.","Cons:Speakers. Now, I never expect built in speakers (from monitors or TVs) to be very good, these are especially mono-sounding. I guess I can't complain as nobody ever relies on them. But I hope that someday a display comes along that actually makes slightly realistic noises.","Other Thoughts:Bought this for my Fiancee's gaming computer, she only dislikes the matte finish of typical monitors. This is definitely matte finish if you're curious.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome monitor for the price,2014-07-11,Pros:Monitor is beautiful with nice stand and great picture. It is fast enough to play any game without noticeable lag. It came without a single dead pixel. It has an array of pre-set modes to adjust lighting without having to having to resort to fine-tuning any settings.,"Cons:As many other reviewers have said, there is a design problem with the power cord. We use this monitor for gaming but we also turn it a bit towards our living room to watch movies. Every time we touch it, it loses power because the power cord does not stay in all the way. This has been a pain but not enough to take an egg off.","Other Thoughts:I am not sure what to do with the power cord issue. I am thinking about gluing this cord or an adapter for it into the socket but I might invalidate my warranty. If anyone has any suggestions, I would really appreciate it.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome monitor!,2014-07-08,Pros:I have 2 ASUS monitors and a great thing about this one over my last one that I bought a couple years ago is that it auto picks up the input method where as my old one I had to go into the menu system and manually set it if I wanted HDMI or DVI etc.  This monitor has a great picture and great response.  Wonderful for gaming and watching movies,Cons:None!!,"Other Thoughts:I would buy another one of these monitors if I had the extra money for it, after 2 asus monitors over the course of 8 years I am greatly impressed that they've kept up their quality.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Okay deal for a larger display,2014-07-07,"Pros:Nice specs and connectivity, plus speakers.  Display is nice, and I like having all three major connection plugs.","Cons:Speakers are too quiet, and the build quality for the base was not at the level I expected it to be.  I had to take apart the base assembly and use pliers to bend the metal brackets before the panel would fit into the base.","Other Thoughts:I bought mine with a rebate offer.  The rebate was initially rejected, since Newegg receipts are not normal store receipts.  A phone call to the rebate processor eventually resolved the issue, and the rebate was eventually approved.",0,0

The display is vibrant and bright.The VESA Wall Mounting is a great feature allowing me to suspend them above my desk with a monitor mount.No dead pixels :),Cons:The speakers are very quiet and shouldn't be part of the decision making process when purchasing this monitor.

All the connection types you could possibly want in this day and age.After finally getting it to work(Other thoughts) it is a very nice monitor.",Cons:None other than it scaring the heck out of me when I first hooked it up and reading bad posts on other forums with similar problems I was having.,Other Thoughts:Okay so here is why I gave it 3 eggs instead of 5 and I am being generous with the 3 because I am a huge Asus fanboy and would give other products that scared me like this a 1 or 2 egg review.When I hooked it up first it didn't scale to fit my monitor. Why with technology where its at would it not fit my screen and I would have to manually do the overscale?Ontop of that issue which really isn't an issue text was hit and miss very blurry. This is what really scared me thinking I would have to RMA it and get a new/different monitor. For some reason the HDMI cable I was using that works with every other device I use did not like this monitor very much. Text was blurry colors were dull and for some reason it didn't even want to work right away. I had to coarse the monitor to work. Sometimes while trying to navigate through the menu or change inputs it would look as if it were turned off but that wasn't the case. The screen was just so dark that I had to look closer to see that there were actually images on the screen but it looked like it had a reverse transparency effect almost blacking everything out.So I decided to try and use the HDMI to DVI cable provided and so far everything is good. Hope it stays that way as I would like to remain a huge fan of Asus products.,1,1

Then I started to play Watch_Dogs, the first game since I got it, I got terrible screen tearing. At first I thought it was just that game, but then I got it in CSGO and Batman Arkham Asylum. I started freaking out and my friend told me to use the DVI-I cable that came with it instead of using a VGA cable with an adapter to go into my video card. And that fixed it, so unless you count my stupidity a con, I have none.",,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,,2014-06-11,"Pros:The monitor works great, I have never had a problem with it.",Cons:The speakers are on the back of the monitor so they aren't that loud. This was to be expected though.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,This Monitor Sucks,2014-06-10,Pros:It's wide and moderately inexpensive.,Cons:You don't have HDMI input? IT WON'T WORK!,"Other Thoughts:Connect DVI or VGA to this and you get an onscreen message: ""No HDMI input available"" after which the screen goes to sleep. The buttons do not work.Apparently, you need to connect HDMI input, THEN the on-screen display buttons work and you can switch input to DVI or VGA. Obviously, this is beyond inane. **** product, I'm not buying Asus monitors again.",1,5
ASUS,VE248H,5,Unusually Wide Display ASUS VE228H,2014-06-07,"Pros:REALLY WIDE! This monitor measures 20 inches wide by 12 inches tall (about 51cm wide by 31cm tall). I was working on a 1024x768 KDE desktop in openSUSE Linux before but I had to change the display res. to 1152x864 to make the desktop, and all it's applications, look right. It's a little weird. I'm sure I'll get used to it. It's just.... odd. A very unusual aspect ratio.","Cons:The downside is that ASUS shipped everything I needed, except the HDMI cable. I had to order that separately *after* the monitor arrived.  The HDMI cable is REQUIRED to get this monitor to display 1080p resolution (1920 x 1080).  I discovered that *after* downloading the users' manual which DID NOT come with the monitor. ASUS! SHAME ON YOU!   I'll admit that I was in a hurry when I ordered this monitor. It was on sale via one of Newegg's email fliers. I've wanted to upgrade my monitor for some time and I just assumed that the width to height ratio would be ""normal"". Boy was I wrong. Oh well.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is the main console for my openSUSE Linux V.12.3 PC. I'm running an AMD FX-8320 Vishera 3.5G Hz AM3+ CPU in an ASUS Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 AM3+ motherboard. (I always prefer ASUS when it comes to motherboards). I'm using  G.SKILL Ares Series 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR3 2400 RAM, and an ASUS Nvidia GeForce GT 640 Video Card out to the ASUS VE228H monitor. As you can see, I'm a big ASUS fan. I've just never seen a monitor with such a wide display compared to the short height. An unusual and unexpectedly wide aspect ratio, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,decent monitor,2014-06-07,"Pros:full 1080p, multiple presets, 2ms. no dead pixels I think.","Cons:the blue ""on light"" from the power button only worked once. Maybe I somehow deactivated it? When the montior is alseep with the PC the orange sleep mode light is on though.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,not what i was expecting,2014-06-05,Pros:it works,"Cons:Washed out colors, black is a mid toned grey while using hdmi cable.","Other Thoughts:adjusted brightness, contrast and gamma for close to a half hour only for a slight improvement.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Horrible Quality,2014-06-03,Pros:None.,"Cons:There is a Bright Dot on screen after about a month of use  (my newegg warranty is now void) and Asus's warranty and returns are very complex and confusing. This monitor has a good picture quality but the durability is very disappointing. I have never had this happen and this is extremely frustrating, because of Asus's customer service on such an expensive item and also on the durability. I will never buy again from Asus because they are way to unreliable.",,5,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,Nice monitor,2014-06-03,Pros:Good resolution and color,Cons:The base is round and sticks out to the front further than I like.,Other Thoughts:Great when on sale.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,BAD PIXEL,2014-06-03,Pros:There was very good picture before the pixel went dead.,Cons:The monitor has a bad pixel after about one month and compared to other monitors from different companies this never happens. I will not be buying another Asus monitor.,,0,6
ASUS,VE248H,1,Dead/Stuck Pixelpalooza 2014,2014-05-28,Pros:Its bigger than my other 2 monitors.Its gorgeous.when i finally got the colors how i wanted them they looked great.,"Cons:The first one I got had 4 dead pixels and a green stuck pixel in the center of the screen.ASUS' customer service on their site is abysmal in the nicest terms.Took 2 weeks for them to end up replacing the monitor and sending it back. During which they did not update me once while they had it so i had no idea when or even if I'd get it back within the month. Then when I got the email saying they where shipping something back(didnt tell me what), They didnt include a tracking number so i had no idea what type of shipping they where using or when i could possibly end up seeing it.","Other Thoughts:Honestly having 2 of these get a stuck pixel within 2 hours out of the box has angered me off to no end. I wasn't mad at all when it happened the first time, I just thought this happens there's nothing i can do but send it back. But after the 2 weeks of waiting with no updates and no feedback from the at all, THEN getting a new one and having an annoying stuck red pixel near the center of the screen after 2 hours of it being on, I'm just done with ASUS for now.I'm asking neweggs customer service if i can even still return it (i have faith in newegg so hopefully they will). And if they will take it back I'm getting a different monitor and it will definitely not be from ASUS.",2,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2014-05-21,"Pros:Perfect size for my desk, it fills my field of vision. It looks great, is as bright as I could ever need, and is very fast for gaming (search for display lag display database to see true results). The cherry on top of all that is of course the very low price. If you're thinking of buying a bigger monitor, this beast won't disappoint.",Cons:none,,6,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,Dead pixel when opened,2014-05-21,Pros:I use this monitor for gaming and it has a good screen for it. The colors are bright and accurate after i changed the color settings manually. Monitor seems to be sturdy and looks slim and nice aesthetically.,"Cons:Bought this monitor on March 15, and was not able to open and set it up until Sunday, May 18 since i was waiting for a wall mount for my TV. When I turned it on I noticed a dead pixel near the middle of the screen, it is very noticeable no matter what I am doing. I emailed Asus right away but no one has gotten back to me for 3 days now. Also I needed to change the color settings to make it look better. The blacks seemed to be washed out and not as good as previous monitors I have owned. I'm hoping that Asus will get back to me and replace this with a working monitor.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Good price vs features,2014-05-20,"Pros:Good packing, sturdy build, standard VESA mounting points, good interface, LED backlighting, and VGA, DVI, AND HDMI inputs. A beautiful display output to boot! How can you go wrong?","Cons:I wish these were more affordable, but the price is okay.",Other Thoughts:Built-in sound almost useless. Asus products are pretty great. I had an old Asus LCD that finally started failing after like 10 years. I would recommend this product and even the brand without pause.,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,great monitor,2014-05-19,Pros:great monitor hdmi connection everything. the blues are are bluer the reds are redder the yellows are you know outstanding. I spent three years looking through a 24 inch screen time for an upgrade.,Cons:nothing yet,Other Thoughts:great monitor for the money the colors pop. great for gaming watching movies next step is to install a tv card and throw out my tv.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,"cheap, ghosting, rebate denined",2014-05-18,Pros:big size and price.  but you get what you pay for,Cons:where do i begin. for the monitor itself the ghosting issue.  if you have an older model then you have to access the asus service menu to turn  off OD.  If you have a newer now turn down trace free.  Although these do help it does not FIX the issue.next is  asus rebate.  total waste of time.  jumping tought hoops when filed correctly.  they know you cant return the monitor without the UPC so they know they got your already so the can denied the claim if they want to and ou cant do nothing about it.  I feel cheated since now I cant return the monitor nor can i get my rebate.  Which aint much but not worth the headach from newegg return policy and Asus rebate service.  I would advise not buying this one or asus brand.  I would also avoid buying any MONITOR product from this site that have rebate because you can not return at all.,Other Thoughts:i was about to start my upgrade build.  mini itx with asus componets and products from newegg.   after just upgrading a new monitor first i dont think i will continue on this site or asus product.  I called tech support and hung up after 30 minute waiting to get a hold of a rep to trouble shoot my monitor  Come on asus.  I feel like asus dont care for their customer once they bought their product.  I felt like Asus was one of the top as in gaming hardware.  but being on TOP means having great customer service too and I think they do not.,4,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing Monitor,2014-05-17,"Pros:Great monitor, very reliable, doesn't get too hot and is very sleek looking",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Ive had this monitor for over a year now with no complaints.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2014-05-16,"Pros:I've had this monitor for about a year now and when I first got it, i had it set up as an extended display for my laptop. That was my first impression of it. It was my gamming monitor and it had never let me down. Now more recently i've upgraded to an actual tower and I bought a second one so I could keep my two monitor set up. As of yet, neither of these monitors have failed me and I would heavily recommend them for anyone who is looking to get a simple 60hz gaming monitor without any lag.",Cons:No Cons what so ever.,,3,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Worth Every Dollar !!,2014-05-16,Pros:Everything,Cons:None that I have come across,Other Thoughts:I've owned one of these monitors for over 3 years now & it has worked flawlessly.

All I can say is WOW!!!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"great 24"" deal",2014-05-15,"Pros:This ASUS monitor was purchased to replace the 7-year old (also purchased thru Newegg) 24” KDS monitor that stopped working.  The ASUS 24” is thinner and does not get as warm/hot as the LCD this item replaced.  Price is great, picture is fantastic and the overall customer satisfaction is very good.  Packaging was very protective and item arrived unharmed, set-up was simple and quick.  If this monitor lasts 7-years I will be extremely happy.  I would rate this product 4.75 out of 5 total satisfaction stars (nobody get a 5/5)!  Really a great deal (so far)!",Cons:N/A,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Questionable longevity,2014-05-14,"Pros:Large, good contrast ratio and refresh rate, no problems initially","Cons:After almost 3 years of use, one of the 2 monitors I purchased has developed the backlight issue where the screen goes black for 1 - 7 seconds and then comes back on. The power light stays on and stays blue, so it's not a cable or signal issue. Disappointing that it didn't last for 3 years.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor at a great price,2014-05-13,"Pros:Size, 1080p, Looks Great, 3 year warranty, Bottom facing inputs for power and video",Cons:Manual adjustment of the color settings needed badly out of the box.,"Other Thoughts:I cant believe how many monitors out there are not equipped for standard VESA mounting at the traditional B&M retailers (Best Buy, Staples, etc.). I originally had an AOC 24"" from Staples that was equipped for a VESA mount, but the inputs were rear facing and blocked by my mounting hardware. I was forced to return the monitor and order one from Newegg. I wish I had just gone this route in the first place as I got a better monitor for less money after local taxes were included. The monitor looks nice but did need manual adjustments in the monitors setup menu. The following settings are what I am using....Scenery ModeBrightness 30Contrast 80Saturation 50Color Temp: User ModeSkin Tone: NaturalSmart View: OFFSharpness 81Trace Free 40Aspect Control: FullASCR: OFFI slightly modified the settings found on Tom's Hardware when searching for the Asus VE247H color settings.

It is very satisfying to the eyes.","Cons:Only con i have is when the title screen comes up on certain games and i can see some shadow on just the one title screen but that's it. viewing movies, web etc etc etc etc its alllllllllllll gud.","Other Thoughts:buy the dang thing, its worth i think, i like to get another one but i want to buy a monitor stand for two first.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Decent but underwhelming monitor,2014-05-11,Pros:Inexpensive monitor that supports HDMI and has built-in speakers. Arrived in perfect condition (no dead pixels or other surprises).,"Cons:Out of the box, the color settings are way off. The built-in speakers are poor quality and have a very low volume level (even at their highest settings). As others have mentioned, the brightness can be a bit much. Perhaps most importantly, the viewing area is small. I imagined it would be bigger for a 23.6"".",Other Thoughts:This monitor is underwhelming - it is a better deal on paper than it is in use. I should have spent a bit extra and gotten a larger monitor and external speakers.,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor,2014-05-11,"Pros:Bright screen, clear picture. I bought this to replace an old, bad Acer 19"" 16:10 monitor that wouldn't go higher than 1440x900, this is an enormous improvement.","Cons:The DVI cable that shipped with it was faulty, wouldn't give me any picture.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Asus VE228H,2014-05-10,Pros:Convenient packaging.,Cons:Speakers aren't that good.This newer model has a very low quality screen where all the colors have a yellowish tone.,"Other Thoughts:I got the same monitor over 3 years ago which still works flawlessly today, and where the color is much clearer than the new one. Asus decided to go cheap on the screens with the newer models.The first monitor delivered had a dead pixel, which also shows how low quality the screens have gotten.About 60% of my PC components and peripherals are from Asus. I'm usually quite satisfied with their products, but after this purchase I'm not certain I'll buy another one.",0,2

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very solid,2014-05-03,"Pros:Color, responsiveness, and features are great.  Extremely bright if needed.",Cons:My old monitor had a light sensor for auto-dimming.  I never realized how much I liked this feature until it was gone.  At night I need the screen brightness turned down ALL of the way (dual 27s light an office more then the overhead light on 3/4 power).,"Other Thoughts:Great product for a great price.

The 2 new ones look amazing, but the 3rd (original one I bought) looks a lot less vibrant as the 2 new ones. This is probably due to the fact that its more than 3 years old. Besides that, it still has great color and vibrancy.Doesnt heat up from over use or after using for extended periods of time.Great for multi-platform gaming.I have a multi channel HDMI receiver that I use to plug in my 1 monitor and use it for my xbox 360, ps3, and as a third monitor for my PC.",2,0

No ghosting or choke ups smooth clean picture with some tweaks to the settings.,Cons:The cables it comes with a garbage. They are incredibly short so I had to order new ones.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Good experience so far,2014-04-27,Pros:I've had the monitor about 5 months now and it's still working great. Screen is nice & bright.

First VH238HSecond VG248QE And newest this VE247HOf course I like the VG248QE best but that's to be expected and I paid for that love and its not in the same ball park as the other two lolReal comparison:I like the new VE247H, It to me has a little bit better coloring, the bezel is thinner, the buttons are way better on the bottom and feel like the are going to last and the small text on screen seems to be somewhat sharper than the VH238H IMO (yes I calibrated them both thru windows)If I had to buy another one it would defiantly be the VE247H unless there was a major price difference because I am thrifty.

I wanted to test them out and I just did not like it and not going to ever be using it so it will not effect the way I think about the monitor itself. still a good monitor all around for the price,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR,2014-04-08,Pros:It looked nice for the 2 weeks I had it...,"Cons:This monitor is a huge mistake of a purchase. After having it for only 2 weeks it received a dead pixel and a large packet of not working pixels. I then went through 3 of their customer service chats to finally be able to do the RMA.Their customer service is literally the worst I have ever experienced in my life. I've been through around 6 of them now with all my problems and all but 2 of them would literally stop typing once I asked them a question so that the chat would time out and my question would be left unanswered.Now after finally getting the RMA that is offered with the purchase of this monitor it took them over 2 weeks to finally send me a reply back about the monitor. And you guessed it, they found no problem with the monitor....So I politely told them to replace it or refund the purchase. There is no excuse for a brand new monitor to get dead/stuck pixels 2 weeks into use and then have me deal with the most atrocious customer service on the planet just to have them tell me there was no problem with the monitor. If I ever even get the ""not broken"" monitor back it will have been over 4 weeks since I sent it to them to get fixed. Completely unacceptable.The monitors buttons are also horrible to get used to to set up the monitor, and the monitor is crazy bright even with the brightness turned down. (Definitely not advisable to be reading things on it for prolonged periods).",Other Thoughts:Do not waste your money on this monitor. It looked too good to be true and it was.,0,0

I don't know how to explain it. I watch movies on my computer. Whenever something meant to be sharp comes on, it gets pixelated. The picture gets all boxes of shades. This can be seen when it's black or white. I just don't know. It has two little speakers, which is nice but it's hidden facing down, so all the noise will go to my desk and just sound very dull. Even if it's mounted, it'll sound dull. I tried plugging in HDMI cable, which sucked because it scaled everything down.

Turning down the brightness to 0 and lowering the gamma of the OS created acceptable blacks but exaggerate the back light bleed on the outer edges even more-so.

I was using my Samsung 40"" smart LED TV as a computer monitor when we decided to use it as a TV again.  She bought this monitor for me and I must say, the picture is even better than my (less than a year old) sammy.  I mostly game on my computer and watch videos, and this monitor has the perfect picture for both.  I am considering using the 2nd HDMI to plug in my PS4 to this as well. I have read other reviews and seen that dead pixels are common, but so far so good none here. Also people don't like the stand? or speakers.

I find myself attempting to adjust for these inadequacies through the clunky built in menu but I can never quite get it tuned to my liking.,"Other Thoughts:This monitor would be fine for someone who is just going to do basic text editing and web browsing. I'm sure it would be excellent, in fact, for just that task. However, for gaming or watching movies, the snowy blacks and washed out whites will drive you mad. And certainly don't try to do any serious photo or video editing on this monitor. You get what you pay for I guess.

ASUS,VE248H,4,So far so good!,2014-03-19,Pros:The screen is huge and has the ability to be used as a TV and Computer Screen. I hooked up my PS3 to the additional input. The built in speakers are not a replacement for desktop speakers but they are decent enough.,"Cons:There are no USB ports.  Totally uncool.  Can't plug in anything to my monitor now.  Also, when I shut off the monitor, it doesn't immediately come back on.  It turns on, says no signal, then goes to standby, then I have to move the mouse to get it to wake up.  I don't think its my computer or power settings because my second monitor comes on no problem.  It might have to do with the way the HDMI signal is sent to the screen.","Other Thoughts:When I first got the screen, it took some getting used to because it was such a huge screen.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Crisp,2014-03-19,Pros:* Color quality meets expectations.* No dead pixels.* Having the built in speakers is a big plus for me as I don't have a set of standalone speakers.

And nothing else. I can actually still go to their site and there is all the documentation laid out, but apparently a ""full audit"" failed to see what I could pull up in a second.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent video quality,2014-03-04,"Pros:Everything you'd expect from a good brand monitor - crisp video, bright colors, excellent refresh rate, etc. Absolutely zero complaints about the image quality. Built-in speakers work through HDMI, eliminate the audio cable. Input switch via button (as opposed to digging through a menu) lets you troubleshoot setup issues quickly.","Cons:The built-in speakers, although better than typical built-in speakers in cheaper monitors, are still nowhere near an actual pair of Altec Lansings or Creatives on your desk. Keep that in mind if you're planning on listening to music or playing games. Controls could use some improvement - couple of status LED's and maybe 1-2 more physical buttons instead of adding layers to the menu.","Other Thoughts:I've been buying ASUS monitors for about 6 years now, and expect to keep buying them for at least as long in the future. Always a solid value for the $$$, never disappointed.",2,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Sharp Image, Love it!",2014-02-28,"Pros:Crystal clear image, I added this as 2nd monitor to go with my ASUS V238 and this VE247 is even BETTER! Great for gaming and watching videos.","Cons:As with most ASUS monitors, the base leaves a little be desired. It is a touch wobbly, but not really a deterrent at this time.Ran into issue with rebate, had to file a 2nd claim with American Express. Original card never arrived.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome and Great Price,2014-02-27,"Pros:Nice size and resolution. Bright with plenty of color temperature modes. Bonus, still manufactured with a VESA 100mm wall mount. 2 HDMI inputs allow my DirecTV and computer to share the same monitor. Matte screen with little to no reflection from ambient light sources.This is my replacement monitor which came with Zero stuck On or Blacked out pixels.","Cons:First unit shipped with 1 stuck on and several stuck off pixels. A remote control for the volume when I watch DirecTV would have been nice, like most of the Samsung monitors have.","Other Thoughts:New Egg followed thru quickly and easily with a prepaid shipping label for my RMA to be processed on the first bad monitor. $189.99 after rebate, president's day discount and instant discounts is a great price. I remember getting a 15inch 1024x768 Sony Flat Screen CRT XGA monitor, back in the 1990's for $700.00. Displays have become quite affordable with LCD technology.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,wide and responsive,2014-02-27,Pros:This monitors refresh rate is stupid fast and the width of this is stupid big. I sit with the monitor about two feet in front me and this monitor covers up a good field of view with plenty of workspace at 1920 x 1080. Runs 1080 formats great and has the ability to be very vivid bright. Has two hdmi ports that share with my ps3 and pc. For this is my second refurbished product and im having buying confidence with newegg. Definitely worth the money for refurbished.,Cons:Ports are bit hard to get access to when you have a wall behind it and such a low profile screen. Speakers are terrible but thats common amongst high end screens but buyers be aware to invest in some speakers (even the cheap dell ones work better) to save yourself the earache.,"Other Thoughts:Bezel aint that bad. This monitor has a good response time (120mhz and 2ms response) so if you're not used to it like me, shooters tend to be a bit awkward at first. Also utilize your gpu driver settings to correct visual issues, catalyst control center worked for me. On set up it might not look pretty but play with the settings.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Beautiful!!!,2014-02-26,"Pros:Everything. I got this monitor VE247H when it went on promo from Newegg and I am extremely happy I did. I am using this monitor in a large toolbox in a dealership. The screen just has a perfect color flow, seems durable and is easy to use.",Cons:Doesn't come with an hdmi cable. However I needed a fairly long hdmi cable which I ordered separate. The cables supplied with the monitor seem to be on the cheaper end.,Other Thoughts:I would definitely buy this monitor again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice monitor.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Better than acceptable,2014-02-26,"Pros:Vivid display with no dead pixels. Color quality acceptable after tinkering with the settings. The default setting is extremely harsh on the eyes, so this step is a MUST. The monitors built-in adjustments are intuitive and easily configured if not using software to adjust image quality.","Cons:No HDMI-to-HDMI cable included (only DVI-to-HDMI and DVI-to-DVI). Stand is cheaply designed, does not allow the screen to be rotated to vertical viewing position, and sets the screen far too low to the surface. Elevation or alternate mounting is almost required for this display.",,0,0

I was so happy with the first, I bought this one for a new rig.I have the monitor hooked up to my computer (DVI) and my stereo/dvd player (mini-HDMI).  I can seamlessly toggle between the inputs.I'm a software developer and stare at monitors all day long.  I use two nice Samsung monitors at work, and before that two nice ViewSonic monitors.  This monitor beats both of those in picture quality and usability.",0,0

No issues and 48"" of viewing bliss.  I game a bit and that's cool, but mostly needed the real estate for 3D CAD/Modeling mostly using Rhino3D and MADCAM to do tool paths.Spent just a few minutes getting the two somewhat balanced color wise and off to the races.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Gorgeous Monitor,2014-02-24,Pros:Great Value and gorgeous screen reproduction excellent video for the price.,Cons:Speakers low quality use external speakers for sound.,Other Thoughts:169 buck excellent value for the size and video quality comes with hdmi dvi and vga inputs and 3.5mm audio jack.  No need for audio that much if you listen to music or watch blurays or dvd's use external speakers the sound is not that great on the I think they are 1 watt speakers so they don't sound very good at higher volumes.  But highly recommend the video monitor for video features are excellent.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,27 inch ASUS monitor,2014-02-24,"Pros:Using two of these in a three monitor setup.  I bit heavier than the newest LED monitors, but is made very well and has VESA adapter and the stand is easily removed.  I have this in a 2 monitor swivel desktop stand as part of 3 monitor setup and it is working well.  Fast refresh, good color and good crisp text.  For the price it can't be beat.  I do not use the speakers.  Also have pretty small profile so not bad for multi monitor setup.  Made very well.",Cons:It is a bit heavy if using VESA 2 monitor stand like I am using.,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,great price,2014-02-23,Pros:This screen is beautiful and its even better that I got it for so cheap.  The size perfect for gaming and watching movies at my desk.  Button layout is nice.  I like the glossy finish to the trim.  Stable stand,"Cons:The speakers that are built into this are weak.  They should have put more effort into putting quality speakers in it.  Personally, i wish there was more than one HDMI port on the back.",Other Thoughts:I think I might get another two of these when it goes on sale again.,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,1 Bright Stuck Pixel + 4 more black pixels,2014-02-20,Pros:This monitor is bright and has a pretty decent display overall. The 2 HDMI inputs allow me to use with DirecTV and My computer without the need to swap any cables.,"Cons:My first unit came with a stuck open pixel, it is a blue pixel maybe stuck at 50%, so not only is it bright on a black field, it is also dark on a blue and white fields. I also had 4 more black pixels.","Other Thoughts:Newegg eagerly issued me an RMA and I am expecting a second unit soon. As I checked for pixel defects first, I didn't need to use ASUS's warranty replacement. Which usually would end up sending out refurbished units, even if you've only had the unit 1 day. So I am happy to be expecting a brand new unit back from Newegg.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Nice,2014-02-20,Pros:Loved the price glad I waited for the discounts.The DVI to HDMI cable was a nice touch I plugged this thing in turned it on and was testing games immediately.Fantastic picture.,Cons:The stand looks good but its junk. I put a soft round mouse pad under it so it was off the wood of my desk and seemed to stabilize it a tad better. i actually read some reviews of this before buying and was aware of stand complaints but at this price I had to check it out.,Other Thoughts:The stand should cost this thing an egg but I have never had any issues with ASUS products ever and easy setup and a gorgeous picture with no burnt pix makes me a happy gamer. This is my second ASUS monitor and its replacing my old trusty beautiful ASUS HDMI 24 inch. I have no idea where some of these reviewers have so many issues with setting up an HDMI monitor as this thing was so hassle free to get going. Maybe do some research and check your PC settings before blaming the monitor for everything. I was skeptical about spending so little for a 27 inch and thought I was getting something cheaper then usual but I was wrong. ASUS messed up on the stand but everything else more then makes up for this thing and I am super happy I took a chance on this one.,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Poor brightness and color consistancy,2014-01-29,"Pros:Good price, speakers aren't bad, screen is bright","Cons:Color hues quickly change depending on viewing angle. Brightness changes depending on colors being displayed. You can literately see the screen dim or brighten when the screen changes from a bright color or dark color. For instance if you are viewing an image in Adobe Bridge, it will appear much brighter because bridge uses white as a background color, than it will in Photoshop because the background colors in that program are gray. This doesn't even happening instantly, you can watch as the whole display dims a half second after opening photoshop","Other Thoughts:I bought this screen mostly for photo editings. I realize it's not the $1,000 pro-viewing screen ASUS sells, but the consistance of colors is worse than my LED tv, and the brightness consistency is terrible!

It's really hard to watch movies on it anymore as all you notice is the light bleed along the top, bottom, left, and right edges.Also, this thing is incredibly bright it is like looking into the sun. Even after setting the brightness to 0 and contrast to 20, it still causes eye fatigue, especially when using it in the dark.It's an ok monitor if you can get it cheap, but it has lots of problems.

The speakers are great for casual computing and watching Youtube or Netflix, but audiophiles will probably want more.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Overall Decent Monitor,2014-01-21,"Pros:Easy setup, good for tight spaces.Good for those who need only ONE DisplayPort, HDMI & VGA connection.Excellent picture quality, no bad pixels, ghosting, other undesired effects.","Cons:No DVD-D, but the specs sates such. Every time it starts, in the upper left corner, it shows the type of connection used. Most users should know what they're running. Sometimes this prompt will show if there's a delay in an app launching on Windows 7 & 8.Speaking of which, there is the lack of an auto sensor to detect the type of connection used. Many far cheaper monitors has this feature.Menu is difficult to navigate/apply settings.Speakers aren't the best, but I was more concerned about picture quality, which hasn't disappointed me.","Other Thoughts:This was my 1st monitor purchase & I have learned from it. Mainly the lack of either a DVD-D connection or 2 HDMI's, as there is no type of adapter that will convert the  DP input for anything other than DP.However, there are DP to HDMI cables/converters. And the trusty DVD-D for those who doesn't need the speakers.This was a learning experience for me in monitor purchasing. However, don't let my review take away the fact that this monitor does give quality video & is fast in doing so.I also give ASUS credit for a fast rebate process, there is the option to get it fast, for a deduction of $2.ASUS is a good brand of monitors. With all of the choices, there is a lot of confusion, sorting the negative reviews out (many 1 egg over rebates),  I'm now more educated for the next purchase.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great for the price,2014-01-21,"Pros:Great sizeNice brightness, currently use at lowest setting and it is plenty bright.Very good colors","Cons:Very bad speakers, do not buy this if you need good onboard speakers.

ASUS,VE248H,4,So far so good,2014-01-21,"Pros:So far so good and for the price I paid, I really can not complain.","Cons:I was having a problem with the HDMI cable allowing me to use max resolution on the monitor, but I don't know if that is a graphics card issue or a monitor issue. I switched over to VGA and everything seems to be fine.  I'll have a new graphics card soon and with luck the HDMI problem will go away.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Speakers died,2014-01-20,"Pros:Initially, this was a great monitor for the price.  Sound was fine for built in and made viewing enjoyable.  I used this monitor for testing computers I repaired and logged under 50 hours total since I bought it.","Cons:After 5 months and having barely even used it, the speakers begin making popping sounds today and there is no sound from the PC or a laptop I used to test with.  I tested the sound on both devices with speakers and they worked, as soon as the monitor was plugged in, no sound or from time to time a crackling/popping sound out of the speakers instead.  I contacted ASUS today and am awaiting for them to respond.","Other Thoughts:As most of the reviews are positive, I am hoping I just got that rare ""lemon"" and that ASUS will replace this for me.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,HUge Moniter speakers are garbage,2014-01-13,Pros:Bought this for my dad.  Its working great.  HUGE screen. Great price Black Friday Deal. 1080p.  Better stand than previous generations but it can be better.,Cons:Speakers are garbage.  Why are they even there I wish I could just save another $5.  I didn't dock an egg because integrated speakers are usually garbage anyways.  But why can't they be good?  We will see how long this lasts I hope a long time.,Other Thoughts:I like how the changed the stand from the previous generations.  I have one of these with the old poopy circle stand and I had to fabricate my own stand out of an old aluminum license plate.  It works great now!,0,0

Same thing happened. So I swapped it with my other monitor and everything worked perfectly. Very angry I bought this monitor because I cannot use it.,,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Excellent Monitor,2014-01-12,"Pros:I purchased this monitor when the 2013 Black Friday deals were in affect and got this monitor mainly for it's excellent price-point and reliable brand name. After using it for a few weeks, I have quickly realized how excellent the quality is of this monitor, even though my original one had to be shipped back due to a dead pixel.This monitor has the average resolution of 1080p, which displays excellently all of my games.The size is perfect, and can fit plenty of information, especially in games.There are different viewing modes (i.e. Theater and Game mode) when you are doing different tasks that really change how the screen looks, great for watching Netflix or playing video games.Finally, comes with a few different cables for interfaces,  but excludes the HDMI cable, as usual.",Cons:The only con consists of the difficulty of adjusting the display settings (which might be in part of my laziness in reading the directions).,"Other Thoughts:Great monitor at a reasonable price, and if it is by Asus, it will definitely give you excellent performance.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great Monitor for the price,2014-01-10,Pros:Nice display.  Bight.  No bad pixels.,Cons:The base stands are plane as can be.  They have very few features and cant be raised or rotated.  They do tilt in the vertical axis.  For the price of this monitor not a issue.,"Other Thoughts:Black friday 2013 deal on this monitor was  one hundred thirty each with a twenty buck rebate card.  I have yet to see the rebate card, or find the paperwork to get it.  Will be asking newegg about that.  But for low cost monitor I would buy another with out worry.UPS was rough on the box(Surprise week after black friday shipping), but the monitor was well packaged and no damage was sustained.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2014-01-09,Pros:Well I love this monitor. I got this to replace my old ASUS 20 inch one the VGA was going bad on it. Came the next day in great condition got it out of the box plug it up using display port for my gaming computer and have it on full 1080p no problems beautiful picture and the most importation thing no dead pixels my old ASUS had three red ones right at the top but it didn’t bother me. Very happy with this also HDMI video is great too have my mom’s computer on that one with the DVI to HDMI cable that was include running two computer on this monitor. Highly recommend.,Cons:None,,2,1

ASUS,VE248H,2,Decent,2014-01-09,Pros:They work... There is no dead pixels that I can see. Also the colors are nice.,"Cons:If you buy two of these, good luck because they will never have the same hue of color or brightness no matter how hard you try.","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these and I had to replace one because I thought the monitor just couldn't get bright enough to match the first. The replacement came in and I think they sent me the same one back that I sent them. Really annoying to buy two monitors and the colors are very different. One monitors white looks white, the other looks like a cream. The grays are clearly different. Basically go for the Samsung monitors if you want a dual set up. If you buy one and you get unlucky you wont notice you've been ripped off buy bad color hues. I wish i didn't buy these and really regret it.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Extremely happy,2014-01-08,"Pros:Good color, anti-glare, smooth graphics. Purchased three at once and all are perfectly color matched with no dead pixels. Love the multiple connections - very flexible for connecting various computers and devices.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Should have sprung for the 27"" screens. The speakers work fine although I don't use them.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,kudos,2014-01-08,"Pros:After three years, I still don't see any dead pixels on the VE248H monitors (we have three).  and they are just as bright and nice after cleaning the front with pure water and a clean, soft cotton cloth.I really appreciate the LED ""backlight"".This monitor may not be perfect, but it was and still is hard to beat for the money.  That's why I still give it 5 eggs.","Cons:it's just a pain to change from the speakers to the headphones (as well as the monitor data cable and the power cord.) The plugs are not easily accessible and about as convenient as removing or replacing the HDMI cable.  All the connectors are at the back, on the bottom, requiring me to hold the monitor upside down so I can see the plug holes.  Speaker and headphones could be more conveniently located  and a menu option to switch from speakers to headphones would be appreciated.The menu labels on the front of the monitor are illegible (this may have changed) with the monitor on normal brightness.  I have to use a flashlight to read them.Also, the plastic case is nice but attracts and shows dust easily.   Can hard, glossy  plastic be made anti-static?","Other Thoughts:If there are dead pixels on yours, this may be a handling problem.  My ASUS 19""  was perfect until I dropped it on the floor.  Dead pixels may be caused by rough handling during shipping.  I suggest paying newegg for express/special shipping-handling whenever possible for critical items, e.g. drives, monitors, motherboards, etc.  When appropriate, I will also ship overnight which I believe reduces the amount of handling.  (Things like computer cases, on the other hand, I ship economically.)I left the shipping plastic on for about two years but it started to peel off so I ended up removing it all last year.  Yes, it is on almost every black surface.I know I have already entered another review or two for this product, probably after buying and possibly another after a year or so of use.About me: I generally build my own computers and computers for friends and relatives since 2000.  I have years of experience writing and maintaining software. I use Windows, Mac OS and linux operating systems. I can generally fix most hardware and software problems and I love to shop for computer stuff.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Nice sleek monitor for a fair price,2014-01-08,"Pros:This is a nice thin, sleek 1920x1080 monitor for the everyday user. It has a modest bezel. The input selection is nice. The color all around the spectrum is very good.","Cons:This monitor is mounted on a very small stand(vertically.) This monitor is asking to be mounted on a monitor arm out of the box. The stand will suffice as stock, as the tilt angles of the monitor are fair.","Other Thoughts:I enjoy playing computer games. While the refresh rate and other specs aren't the best of what I have read up on, this monitor fits the bill for me. So much so I decided to get a second, and a third in time. I have 2 of these with a single 760, no problems to report.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Quality! Wish I had 2 More,2014-01-06,"Pros:I am comparing this to 2 other monitors I own both different brands, they are: Lenovo 22 Inch 1080p LED Monitor, and Samsung 20 Inch LED 720p Monitor.HDMI, VGA, and DVI, Built-in-Speakers, No dead pixels, Easy Input Selection Control. Awakes from Sleepmode, Good Sound for built in speakers","Cons:Mounting Stand seems a little small for such a large monitor, wish I could move it up and down not just tilt. But I knew that going in","Other Thoughts:For the sale price $139.99 this was the cheapest 24 inch monitor I could find (23.6 in you cant tell) I actually returned a 22inch that I paid $149.99 on BLACK FRIDAY!) Great Deal when I got it.For those with display issues via HDMI, this seems to be a huge problem for those connect HDMI via GPU, or Onboard graphics. You need to go to your display providers setting application. For radeon it is CCC Catalyst Control Center, Nvidia it is the Nvidia Control Panel (i think been awhile since I bought Nvidia most games are use AMD tech right now personal preference). And Scale to 1080p and the scale to your monitor. HDMI in CCC go to HDTV settings. After that you are looking at a crystal clear display.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,One dead pixel,2014-01-05,Pros:Great quality pictureLarge,Cons:One dead pixel after not even a year of ownership,"Other Thoughts:Not really a con, but I wish the screen would autodetect input (ex: if it's set to my PC-DVI and nothing is turned on, and I go to turn on my Xbox-HDMI the screen doesn't change which is annoying)",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good Monitors for the price,2014-01-04,Pros:Very good monitors for the price. I would recommend it to anyone thats looking for a decent HD monitor. The screen is crisp and clear and everything looks completely fine.,"Cons:-Doesn't come with an HDMI cable-The stand for the monitor is pretty weak I mean the monitors can wiggle extremely easy with just the tiniest amounts of friction.-No way to raise the height of the monitor, but thats just wat you get for the money you spend I guess.","Other Thoughts:The only reason i knock an egg off is that I bought 2 monitors for a dual screen setup, and everything works well, but 1 monitor that was shipped to me has a tiny dead pixel, which is very disappointing from an ASUS product. The pixel isn't extremely bad. I honestly don't think it will make me ship the monitor back, Mainly cause I don't want to wait a month for them to give me a non defective one. So I might just suck it up",0,0

I bought it when they offered me a rebate of $20.00, so I bought too thinking I would save $40.00 Unfortunetaly, Asus rebate system is made in such a cryptic way that after I sent all the documentation they required, they denied it because my shipping tags weren't clear enough. I reply and told them that there wasn't nothing I couldn't do since the tags got damaged since when they were shipped tape was put over them and this ruined the tags when I removed them, and still they didn't offer me any other alternative. I told them I could take a picture of the 2nd shipping tag I had on my 2nd monitor and send that one, and they didn't reply, so my $40.00 rebate was lost.

ASUS,VE248H,3,"Great monitor, but left disapointed",2013-12-23,"Pros:Great monitor, response time (although i can't tell between 2ms and 5ms), I LOVE the fact it tilts downward as well.  The size for the price i got at newegg was wonderful. Much better than the 7 yr old 19"" lcd tv i'd been using for a monitor the past 2 years.","Cons:I've bought, installed, and recommended Asus products to friends and family in the past due to high quality and reliability. So i was excited to get this monitor at a great price, with all these bells and whistles. I was shocked to find 2 dead pixels within a week of opening up and installing (unfortunately did not open within 7 days of purchase/receiving), According to Asus's website  ""In order to deliver ultimate vision experience to ASUS customer, if your panel is less than or equal to the above number (3-5) of dots, then, it is considered as an acceptable LCD monitor""... ""acceptable"" is considered ""ultimate"" by any stretch of the english language. Those limits are pretty much the standard everywhere. congratulations ASUS for being acceptable, average, on par with everyone else :) I can't return it because i sent out my UPC for rebate before the spots showed up, so no returns to newegg for a refund either.I guess i'll be praying for more dead pixels so they will be able to deliver me am ""ultimate viewing experience"". Some ""premium"" monitors have a zero bright dot policy. I probably would have waited longer and bought one instead if it wasn't some $400 monitor for essentially the same product. I wish i had known about that. After my old monitor died 2 years ago i was using a 7 year old 19 inch lcd TV for a monitor. No dead pixels on that thing!  Pressing on it, and cycling colors over it has not fixed it either.","Other Thoughts:There's nothing special about the monitor, aside from the pixels the only issue i'd had was the speakers. I didn't buy the monitor for speakers, but they are a sad, SAD joke. I can have cheap headphones on my desk and hear louder audio from them. Even Cell phones have louder earpiece speakers. Why bother having speakers that you can barely hear with everything set to maximum? Aside from the features to price i paid ratio, I can't really recommend this monitor over any other similar one.",0,0

This was a brand new purchase and its does not work....I could file rapid replacement but they charge me first and then refund me after all is done. I paid 130$ with 20$ rebate so IF asus honors the rebate then 110 is a good price for this monitor IF it worked. If i dont dont get rebate back as some have, I will raise bloody hell with newegg and asus (probably to no avail) as the rebate is why i just didnt get instant replacment from newegg.","Other Thoughts:If this is the only part of my new build that doesnt work i will be happy, as i ordered everything from newegg.\If this pc wasnt going to be sitting for the next few weeks anyway i would not be returning it BUT i would never buy asus monitor again.

The colors are very vivid and the monitor is very bright.  I turned my brightness settings down to 11 when I game so it wont burn my eyes out.  I would rather have it too bright and turn it down then not bright enough! The speakers are actually decent for a monitor, I usually have a headset on but when I dont I do not notice any issues with the sound.  Overall great monitor.",Cons:Knocking an egg because sometimes text apears to be slightly fuzzy.  When I am reading an article or working on a Word Doc. I notice one line will be laser crisp and the line under it will be slightly hazy. When I scroll up or down to see if its just my eyes the same area of the screen remains hazy and everywhere else is clean.  I never notice this when playing games or watching movies only when there is black text on a white background.,"Other Thoughts:I think this is a great monitor and I would reccomend it to others, I can play any game I want in the ""Ultra"" settings and it looks amazing.",0,2

A real value for the price!,"Cons:Don't make the mistake of touching the controls at the bottom of the monitor.   I just shut off my sounf because the instructions for the controls are obscure.  I tried to consult the Users Guide, even downloading the English version, without an increment of clarity.  The worst users guide I beleive I have ever dealt with.  Everyone seems to be in on rthe secvret of how to manipulate these buttons but they defy me.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Not Bad,2013-12-16,"Pros:Good Contrast and Brightness, Picture in Picture. Good price","Cons:Height not adjustable (should have checked it before I ordered) and that default height is very low where I'm looking down at it.

ASUS,VE248H,4,ASUS VE247H,2013-12-15,"Pros:Excellent size, bright, good color, sharp detail. A fine picture at a good price.",Cons:Stand is fairly lame. The base grabs the monitor down pretty low so there is some back and forth wobble if you bump it or the desk. Not a lot of side to side wobble. The stand also lacks height adjustment and swivel.,"Other Thoughts:I really don't understand the crummy stands on most monitors nowadays. Really, how much would it add to the price to upgrade the stand? I'll make one concession; I'll give back the height adjustment, that can be worked around somewhat. But give me the darned swivel base and make the whole thing more sturdy. Your monitor shouldn't wobble when somebody walks past your desk on a creaky floor.The stand on this monitor is no worse than most and it may be better than some, but go the extra five bucks or so and put a decent swivel-base stand under your monitors.",1,1

Decent sound.","Cons:Bought it to PIP my Verizon TV service while having a digital connection. In no way did this support this, I would have to downgrade to VGA, and even once I did that, there is no audio that comes from the small screen. The PIP is useless. Do NOT buy this monitor based on this feature or you will be out $300. It only has one HDMI input which has already caused a problem.","Other Thoughts:Good quality monitor with no PIP support, pretty angry at myself for not doing the due diligence to make sure it would suit my needs.",0,4

The price/quality ratio is excellent.,"Cons:The two displays do not seem to match perfectly when the same image is compared sided by side on both. It might have something to do with one being on DVI and the other on HDMI. However, the DVI image looks better than the HDMI so it may be a tolerance issue in manufacturing.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Bright & Quiet,2013-12-13,Pros:Bright. Excellent warranty.,Cons:Nearly useless speakers.  Control labels virtually invisible.,"Other Thoughts:One might guess by my pros and cons that I'm older.  I am and I'm regularly annoyed by products, software and websites designed by teenagers trying to be trendy with the popular gray7 on gray8 color scheme.  Come on Asus.  I can buy 0.3W speakers at a a dollar store that are louder and clearer than the ones you put on this monitor.  The labels for the controls are actually insulting.  With my glasses on at a normal distance all I can see are some smudges.  I have to use a flashlight to read them.If you are 16 and have perfect eyes and ears and are on a budget, this monitor is for you.",3,0

No dead/bad pixels at all.Bright, vivid colors.Looks good right out of the box.",Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:This monitor compares quite well with the VE248 that I already own.  I can detect no differences in the display quality.It drives me nuts that monitor manufactures all think that all anyone wants to do with a monitor is watch HD movies.

ASUS,VE248H,3,Enlightening,2013-12-11,"Pros:Big, bright. 2 HDMI's. A headphone jack!",Cons:Blacks are not black (enough).,"Other Thoughts:I bought this alongside a 22 inch Samsung for dual setup. I can now definitively say, at least for myself, Samsung monitors are better when it comes to picture quality. Side by side, dragging a 1080p movie across the screens in VLC, the Samsung monitor blows away this monitor with more realistic color, and pitch blacks. The color on this monitor always has a weird artificial coloring to it. Blacks are washed out. White people in movies a lot of times look red faced like they are furious or something. Even whites aren't as true white. Blues look duller as well. The only colors that don't suffer on this monitor may be brights. Like reds look fine but that's probably because they are over done on this monitor considering white people can sometimes look way too red as I've said. That being said, it does have a headphone jack which I needed because the TV I bought doesn't. I am preparing to get the new consoles and I like headphones better than speakers so this was a big deal for me. So this serves it's purpose, got it for 200 bucks. Just wish the picture quality was higher. It's kind of crazy that I still choose to watch movies on my much smaller 22 inch than this one because the picture is that much better. Moral of the story; if you can, buy Samsung people. I don't know what they do but it's magic.",1,0

It was great before the flimsy LCD glass cracked for no obvious reason.If you get a good one, the visual quality of the monitor is unquestionable.",Cons:Don't make the mistake of believing a manufacturer's response to a negative review is evidence of a positive outcome. Asus 'customer loyalty' responders know that the impression given is one of resolution even if their 'help' begins and ends with acknowledgemnt of an unhappy customer. Do your homework. Asus warrantee and repair has a terrible reputation for good reason.,"Other Thoughts:As stated in my other, two star review, I will be buying from another 4 letter 'A' name manufacturer in  future. Not only is the alternative less expensive, but they are also far more dependable in my experience. Point in case: My 24"" equivalent to this Asus model has traveled over 20000 miles in my luggage during business airline travel and performs as good today as when first unboxed.

The presets are not the best. I think I'll be attempting to get them fully dialed for some time to come.The stand is flimsy. Any bump to the desk makes it rock. Even pushing the menu/settings buttons makes it wiggle a bit. Although it does seem to be seated well. The arm from the stand to the monitor could just be reinforced a bit more.,Other Thoughts:I endorse this monitor. It has a nice picture quality. games look quite nice on it.

No dead pixels but the dim spot on screen is concerning. It is mainly noticeable when there is a white back ground behind the spot and always draws my attention to it.,Other Thoughts:Happy with the screen overall but the dim spot made me take an egg off.

ASUS,VE248H,2,The major little peeve,2013-12-05,Pros:I bought two of these and they work well.HOWEVER (Read cons),"Cons:So I bought two, they aren't the same height???  WHAAAT??.  Side by side on a flat surface one of these monitors is about a centimeter taller than the other.  This may sound like a petty thing, but it is just to the point that it is VERY noticeable and extremely frustrating for the inner pseudo-OCD.  If you are looking for more than one of these, be warned.  If you are just making a single purchase don't worry it works fine.- Can't swivel it sideways with stock mount.","Other Thoughts:I know my review sounds SUPER complainy, but I am having a bit of buyer's remorse on these two now.  I wish I would have done a little more homework and gone with a better choice.",5,1

Outstanding picture quality and refresh rate, especially for the price. I have ran this puppy for countless hours, I'm sure it surpasses 1000+ hours and it is still going strong. You cannot beat this monitor, especially for the price it is now compared to $213 when I bought it.",Cons:None what so ever.,Other Thoughts:Simply outstanding.

ASUS,VE248H,3,Does Not Meet Expectations,2013-12-05,"Pros:It's big, but then again you know that ordering it.Images are crisp. I've heard complaints that 1080P monitors larger than 24"" can start to show individual pixels more readily because the dot pitch needs to get larger to accommodate the large screen, but the image still seems fine on this unit.Refresh rate of 2ms seems great, but I honestly can't tell the difference between that and the refresh rate of 5ms on my previous monitor.","Cons:One dead pixel, colors aren't as vibrant when compared to my 4 year old value model competitor LCD monitor (even after tweaking the RGB settings, etc.)","Other Thoughts:My biggest issue was with the dead pixel in the middle of the screen.  I understand that it is common for displays to have one or more dead pixels right out of the box, but after having used at least 10 brand new monitors from a competitor (personally and for work) and not one of them having a single dead pixel I am left understandably unimpressed.  Granted it's a minor flaw, but that's all it will take for this guy to go back to my tried, trusted and true display brand of choice and not buy another Asus product.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Wow what beautiful monitors!,2013-12-04,"Pros:Excellent monitor. Looks absolutely beautiful. Has no dead pixels thank goodness. The power consumption on these is amazing, and the preset video settings that you can cycle through are amazing. I personally enjoy standard mode because I don't really go into the depths of messing with settings but all the settings are there if you want to change it and stuff.I don't use the speakers so I'm not going to put anything down for those, I hear mixed reviews about those.","Cons:There isn't really much of a con except for this small exception. The stand does wobble a bit if you accidentally bump your desk while I can imagine that it would be difficult to stabilize your desk if it wobbles already on its own. In my case I just need a new desk but with exerted force these screens will wobble. Normal typing however, not a wobble in sight.",Other Thoughts:I got these for such a good deal.. I mean wow.

Driving all four with a single four output Galaxy GeForce MDT GT 520 PCI Express 2.0 Quad DVI Multi-display Graphics Card.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great deal for the money,2013-12-04,"Pros:LED screen is very bright and responsive.  Color palate and blacks are rich for this price range.  Black Friday deal for $109 after rebate made this a no brainer, but at it's normal cost of $129 I would definitely recommend this screen for budget conscious gamers looking for a deal.","Cons:Base stand is a little flimsy but not overly so.  For this price range it is hard to complain about the ticky-tack stuff.  Blacks are good but not great, so if you play games with lots of darkness you may notice.  I just color/gamma balanced the display so it is not noticeable at all.  I use this for video editing as well which is how I noticed in the first place.  Again, at this price range this is a steal.  I am just nit picking.","Other Thoughts:I tend not to like rebate deals because they are a hasstle, if it becomes a real headache I'll come back here and change the egg rating but so far this screen is great.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Budget Gaming Monitor,2013-12-03,Pros:-Size-2ms Response Time-Affordable,Cons:-Blacks bleed at edges-OD set on by default,"Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor while it was on sale for $110 during Black Friday/Cyber Monday 2013. It interested me because I wanted an affordable monitor that would well with gaming and with a good sized screen. The monitor is bigger than you would expect considering it is 23.6"". You have to play around with the settings to get it how you want. Menus are alright, but what drives me crazy is the monitor turns OD on by default which you do not want if you don't want ghosting. Monitor also seems to think it turns off when an all black image (or really dark image for that matter). When that happens OD will turn back on. It sucks that OD was not just in the regular settings menu because of this issue.Overall if this a first monitor for you or if you are looking for an affordable dual monitor setup I really think this isn't a bad choice.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Good bang for the buck!,2013-12-03,"Pros:Price, energy efficient, light weight, nice display,  3-yr warranty, rebate, free shipping, no tax.","Cons:No HDMI cable. The dvi, vga & audio cables are all about 1 ft shorter than my existing cables. The supplied large instruction sheet is printed in many-many different languages and for the limited info provided is very spread out and not clear. The built in speakers are not great, but adequate for general listening purposes. The monitor has no height adjustment, but that is not a big deal for me.","Other Thoughts:My old Samsung monitor served me well for many years but recently started to whistle periodically.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Exactly what I wanted,2013-12-03,"Pros:I was a little bit tentative about buying this monitor due to half and half good/bad reviews (which is usually a bad sign), but with the Black Friday sale price of $109 it was too good a deal to pass up.The monitor is everything advertised. Great picture, extremely fast refresh rate, great monitor size. No dead pixels or other problems.","Cons:The monitor's buttons are very responsive, but the control scheme is very unintuitive and a pain to use.I haven't been able to get the speakers working yet, but I don't think that's the monitor's fault.

The picture is amazing, although it did take some googling/tweaking to get to this point. (My setting are below). I went with standard free shipping and received the monitor in two days O.O If you are planning on using DVI or VGA it comes with cords for both, however if you plan on using HDMI (like me) you need your own cords. The built in speakers are pretty lousy but I was prepared for this due to the many other reviews stating this. One thing I wasn't expecting was the short power cord which forced me to add a power strip to my setup. If your picture doesn't display full screen when first connect (mine didn't) just set scaling factor in ATI to 0 and you should be fine.

With it being marked down from over $200 to only $110 after the rebate I don' think it gets any better. Great for those looking for an entry level gaming monitor with decent refresh rates and low input times but don't expect the best color quality on this monitor.

What is worse, it is by far the poorest quality sound I have ever heard from any speaker.  One reason I selected this monitor is because of the built in speakers and I am so disappointed in them.  My powered speakers do not auto power up, so it is nice to have some sound when I choose not to power them on.  If not for the sound, this monitor would be rated 5 eggs.Menu controls are cumbersome, but since you seldom readjust, it is ok.","Other Thoughts:Newegg delivery time is incredible, thank you.When using an HDMI connection, the picture is NOT full screen.  Don't know why, it should be a 1080p full screen video signal, but it is scaled down with black borders all around.  Using HDMI, there is terrible ghosting because of the scaling.  No ghosting with DVI though.  Another user commented on this.  Just use the DVI cable or select a different monitor.  I have not tried it with my bluray player to see if it scales down for it too.Be aware that the 22"" 16:10 monitor is a taller screen height.

Built in sound not very good but passable.",Other Thoughts:Screen adjustments really no worst than the other 20+ monitors I have own. Better instruction on the combination and sequence of buttons need to set adjustments would be nice. Wasted 20 minutes figuring out the combination needed and to get the adjustments required for a good picture. I have connected using HDMI to an PS3 and Xbox 360 and works great.

It's a great monitor, and I'll definitely be looking to ASUS again for my next monitor, but wait til it's on sale if you can. ASUS products always seem to be going on sale.The main point I'd like to get across is that this monitor is a frikkin tank.I may have a little bit of an anger issue when gaming, and my last monitor (a Dell) has some discoloration spots where my fist may have kissed the monitor.Needless to say, that got annoying, so I replaced it with this monitor.My anger issues are still roughly the same, maybe worse (I should really probably get those checked out), and this monitor has certainly witnessed it.Not only has it taken quite a few more punches than the Dell did, it's taken some slightly harder ones.No discoloration, no damage, nothing.The worst that's happened is that the power cable wiggled itself out and I had to plug it back in.While yes, it's stupid that I punch my monitors, I have to count myself lucky that ASUS builds such a tough monitor.If you have some anger issues, or have kids or pets that might be a danger to your monitor, definitely check this one out.",4,0

I might have given more thought to the monetary benefit of maintaining a customer over the cost of a bit of inventory, were our positions reversed, but it is clear that Asus and I differ in this respect.What I do not accept is Asus' proposal to repair my monitor at a cost greater than the original purchase price. In fact, I find myself atypically offended by the lack of consideration such a gesture extends to a recent and, until today, a frequently repeat customer.For what it is worth, I thank Asus Customer Service for lending credit to the negative reviews I chose to ignore during my original purchase decisions. I, too, have acted on calculated risk. I will no longer be doing so to the benefit of Asus.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Very Dissapointed with Customer Support,2013-10-21,"Pros:It was a great monitor for me, wonderful compared to my old one and I have no problems with the way it worked in any way. The problem came when it needed to be fixed and I tried to contact ASUS customer support. It's been an absolutely horrible experience.. I wrote up a ticket, called the office and they told me all their agents were busy and to leave a message. This was 4 days ago, and I've been visiting the live chat but it's never up as well.

For the $130 I paid you can't beat it.  If you want the top of the line unit then pick a different model.  The VE247H does swivel from side to side but does not raise or lower as the more expensive models do.  This works great and has no problem displaying anything I have thrown at it.  The buttons are located on the bottom of the monitor which is weird but doesn't seem to be to much of a hassle, just different I guess.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Happy - dual system use & gaming,2013-10-10,"Pros:Bought about a month ago and used almost daily. It has performed above my expectations. I run video games and have upped my game due to larger screen, fast update and very bright/vibrant display.I hooked DVI port to an older laptop, one HDMI to a new laptop, and planned the second HDMI to a tablet, but I find no need for that yet. I simply press the video source button to switch between the two systems, both are setup for dual display. One keyboard in front of the huge monitor and laptops on each side. If I need to monitor the task on the laptop not displaying on the Samsung monitor, I push that task onto the laptop display. Mostly the second laptop is off. In the rare cases that I need to do some work on the second system, I flip the monitor to that system, and move the USB plug for the keyboard from one laptop to the other.No need to buy a monitor switch.I am very happy with this purchase.","Cons:Hmmm - I replaced my 21"" monitor with this monster, I guess the only CON is both my kids will now want one of these big monitors or the 32"".",Other Thoughts:It would be nice to have a USB port that has a switch capability to switch a keyboard & mouse from one PC to another.  If you ask developers how they work - you'll find they purchase video/keyboard/mouse switch boxes and one monitor. If that were integrated into the monitor you would be ahead of your competitors. You already do it with your video switch.,2,0

(like watching a movie that has a black bar at the bottom and top) but this has it on all sides.This can be fixed tho. To do so make sure you updated your amd drivers to the latest version.Then right click the (CCC) AMD Catalyst Control Center at the bottom right of your screen (where all the little icons are)Then  mouse over ,Depending on how many monitors you have, 1.(your graphics card name) or 2.(Your graphics card name) and go to ""Set Desktop Area"" then ""Basic"" then ""1680x1050"" or whatever resolution you prefer.Took me a lot of googleing to figure it out since all the tutorials i found where for a older version of CCC.",4,1

ASUS,VE248H,3,Decent,2013-10-02,Pros:- Very bright- Looks great in games. So far I only used it for League of Legends and minecraft.- Stand is decent,"Cons:- You basically have to edit the settings, the ones out of the box aren't very good.- Was going to buy another monitor that was better quality but had no speakers, bought this one because of the 40 dollar promotion code at 209 dollars, after the promotion code went off the price dropped to 175. Wish I would of waited so I spent money on a different model, now I'm stuck with this one.- Can't seem to use turtle beaches with them, so console gaming (for me) is out of the question (i think this is normal for all monitors, though)- Youtube and other streaming videos are fairly blurry for me. I tried 3 different cables, the dvi it came with, and 2 hdmi, and I also tried adjusting my settings, updating flash, new browser, updating graphics drivers and nothing seemed to work, it seems youtube videos are lower quality then my other 7 year old 720p monitor.","Other Thoughts:Overally a decent monitor, I suggest spending more to get a better quality one though.",0,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great value,2013-10-01,Pros:Great picture via DVI.  Great value considering the size and picture quality.,Cons:The monitor wobbles when I bump the desk even a little bit.  The screw that connects the base to the monitor is as tight as it will go.  It just seems like the monitor is too wide for the base to be completely stable.,"Other Thoughts:Minus 1 egg for the wobble, but for the overall quality vs price I'm happy.  Love ASUS products!",0,0

No dead pixels or other defects.","Cons:Max 60hz refresh rate, I bought it in a hurry cause my old monitor died so that was a little bit of a surprise but not a huge deal and no fault of anyone but myself for not seeing that before buying.",,1,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2013-09-26,Pros:The price is reasonable for me and the picture is great. That is really all I look for in a monitor... I use this mostly for gaming and I do not use the built in speakers at all so I can not give an opinion on those.,Cons:None I love it.,,0,0

The first one I received had two dead dark pixels, I sent it in for a replacement and the next one had dead bright pixel. Tried all the online tools and tips for fixing pixels, no luck. Does ASUS just see these and wrap them up anyway for selling to people who probably won't care? Quality control seems like a problem given all the reviews.",Other Thoughts:It seems like a great product for those who get lucky to get a good one. They must be so cheap because ASUS is not picky about what the customer receives.,2,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Nice Monitor,2013-09-16,"Pros:Solid monitor for the computer, xbox360, etc.",Cons:The only knock on it is I frequently change the inputs between the computer and the 360. It would be nice if it would switch faster.Speakers are useless. I wouldn't mind if they ditched the speakers so this had a slightly lower price. Speakers are horrible as expected but you have bigger problems if that is your sound solution.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Black dot in the center of the screen,2013-09-16,Pros:Nice color and clarity.,Cons:New out of the box and already a Black dot (dead pixel I assume) right in the middle of my screen. Very annoying every time I look at anything.,,1,0

Excellent monitor!","Cons:Two cons:The stand it comes on seems somewhat flimsy. However, I never used it, since I slapped this bad boy on a monitor wall mount.This monitor is actually not very good for text. Text comes out choppy and distorted on this monitor. It's readable, but for whatever reason by default the text is pretty bad. On Windows, using Microsofts ClearType text software, you can make the text look perfectly fine! If it wasn't for this software however, not sure what I would do to fix this.","Other Thoughts:For the price and performance, definitely worth the buy!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Bought a pair of them,2013-09-12,Pros:I got  these to replace a pair of old Dell monitors and I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  Most  use is for Photoshop so I really had to dial-down just about every viewing option available but that was not a problem.  Gamers would probably never touch those setting because of the vivid/saturated colors.Rebates were received within the expected time.,Cons:Wish there was a height adjustment because the tilt can only give you so much.I tried the onboard speakers for a few songs then disconnected the audio cable.  Went back to my old speakers and smiled.,Other Thoughts:Overall... great monitors for the price.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great buy,2013-09-11,"Pros:Price, size, quality.  I was very surprised at how great this monitor looked next to my 2 year old 22 in ACER.

ASUS,VE248H,2,very annoying that it cannot detect HDMI video input automatically,2013-09-09,Pros:good color,"Cons:Just noticed that it cannot detect the input from HDMI port automatically. I had it connected to a ATI 7790 and everytime I have to press the button behind the panel to help it detect the signal from GPU before use. And I have to use ""over scale"" feature from ATI control center to have a full screen. This is very annoying.Please let me know if there is any setting to make the monitor detect HDMI input automatically so that when I turn on the PC, I don't have to press the button behind the monitor to make it work.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Great monitor IF you get one that isn't defective.,2013-09-09,"Pros:Quality image, consistent black levels, very little backlight bleed - for a monitor this price and higher, physical buttons make it easier to set OSD.","Cons:First 2 showed up with blemishes inside the screen (on one) and bad pixels (on the other).  I RMA'd them with Newegg.  Second pair showed up - one monitor is fine, the other has a green stuck pixel in the middle/bottom of the screen.  That's 3 out of 4 ""bad."" Unfortunately, Flexcode.org's bad pixel fix (tapping as well) wasn't able to do anything to get the pixel unstuck.","Other Thoughts:I've been buying ASUS's high end products consistently for 10 years and have never seen such atrocious quality control. If my next monitor does not show up in acceptable condition, I will return them all and purchase a competitive product from a local store where I can verify they're fine before I walk out.",11,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,The worst monitor I have,2013-09-08,Pros:None. I can't believe this trash have so many 5 stars!!!,"Cons:I say it is a TRASH because:1. There is no port DVI  for a 1080P big screen computer monitor. I am IT professional of university, this is only big screen model I have met without DVI . I don't want explain why the DVI is important for a big screen monitor, because every technical person knows it.2. I have the 26' Hanns.G 1080P monitor and the Samsung 46' LCD 1080P TV connected with my PC HD7950 video card, and bother work great. However, I get a nightmare after I replace my Hanns with this Asus. It always shows me black screen.3. I connect it via the HDMI port with the DIV-HDMI cable. The PC can be powered on, and I can see the initial information and the Windows 7 startup logo. After that, It gives me a black screen and stops working, and the 46' TV doesn't work too. I set Multiple displays as ""Duplicated these displays"" in Windows 7. So, I have to manually power off PC because I can't see anything on both screens.4. I connect it via the VGA port with a VGA cable and a DIV-VGA adapter. The same problem above happens again.5. I disconnect 46' TV from my PC, and connect the monitor with VGA port. Then, the monitor finally works good so that I can log into Windows 7 and use it. However, the font of words (including system's font, browser's font, website font, software's font) is less clear than my old 26' Hanns monitor which has the DVI port.6. I switch the VGA port to HDMI port with the DVI-HDMI cable, and the monitor works. However, the weird thing is that the displaying area is reduced to 24'.  It looks like I open a 24' windows above the 27' desktop and there is a black framework around the 24' section. I try everything I can but can't fix it.7. I bought Hanns 26' at $150  one years ago, and bought this Asus 27' monitor at $200 promotion ($270 regular) recently. I CANNOT see any advantage of this monitor by comparing with my old one in the general usage and the performance of gaming. The only issue is I pay more 33.3% money to get a worse one.8. No manual and no CD, only a cheap printing Quick Start Guide, worse than my old Hanns (with Color manual, CD, Quick guide).---------------Suggestion:1. NEVER use it with other monitor together, otherwise, you will get a nightmare. I have manually powered off PC at least 8 times when the PC stocked during the debugging of the problem, and I am worrying about the possibility of damage of my PC now.2. NEVER use it as a office monitor because the clarity of font will make your eyes uncomfortable after hours working. Gaming is good as the same as the advertising of the monitor, ""Gaming only"".",Other Thoughts:Do some research about basic technical issue before buying this monitor. It is NOT worth you money even though at promotion sale.,4,22

This is why I went with this monitor and spent the extra $20.00! that is hogwash excuses, I would return it but I'm not going to waste the time and money to loose re-stocking fee and shipping, nonsense! I would have never bought it if the overview description said: ""No full screen resolution on HDMI connection"" All customer support did was give me the instructions that are common sense, and I had already done. their best excuse was ""that my video card did not support it"" well I'm not a gamer but why the other brand monitors give me full resolution and definition with HDMI cable?

Im not sure what exactly to call it but it looks like a smudge going across the screen. It happens most when watching video or playing high end games but never comes up on the desktop or games like Killing Floor. I tried to change several settings in the AMD control center including lowering the Hz from 60 to 59Hz but it just moved the location of the smudge.

Not that big of a deal, but when you have a dual screen set up and each monitor is on a different surface, it'd be nice to have.","Other Thoughts:I bought one of these style monitors a few years back (The VE249) and I loved it, even though I paid an arm and a leg because I bought it at Best Buy. When my dad was in the market for a monitor I recommended this style. He wound up getting the VE248 when it came on sale and he's loved it ever since. I saw this guy up for sale and wanted to a dual screen set up so I bought it and I love it. I'm considering buying a forth and making my dual screen set up a triple screen.

Also great for student use, office use, etc. Unfortunately it just isn't the nicest of monitor, so if you're looking for a high end, true to life reproduction, look to spend a bit more money.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,,2013-08-12,Pros:This monitor is beautiful to look at. It is just perfect for my needs. It does everything as described.,"Cons:The unfortunate thing is that it does not have a DVI port which is what I was expecting.

Design is simple, maybe a little too plastic-oriented for my taste, but easy to get used to.","Cons:When I first bought the monitor, the refresh rate of 2ms did produce slight ghosting. However, after buying a new GPU and replacing the video cable, it hasn't appeared since.","Other Thoughts:Never gotten a monitor with a dead pixel, and this was the first monitor I'd received which other customers warned me about ""ghosting"". Statistically speaking, dead pixels are often a rare find, and its often better to RMA immediately than try to find a solution.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing Monitor,2013-08-03,"Pros:Brilliant color. I couldn't believe how amazing my PS3 looked on this monitor. Looked better than my TV, really. I've been playing with it while I wait for my gaming rig to come in next week, and I have to say for the price I payed, I am completely satisfied. Comes with a VGA and a DVI so you are pretty well covered unless you are wanting to use HDMI, which isn't supplied.","Cons:-Didn't come with an HDMI. Not really a big deal, you can get one at Wal Mart for twelve dollars, and I guess you can't blame them for not giving you one.-Almost too bright. Out of the box, I really had to dumb the settings down. My eyes were burning after a couple matches of Battlefield 3, and I realized it was way too bright and sharp. Not really a Con, since you can easily just turn it down with the menu buttons, but still thought I would point it out.","Other Thoughts:Buttons on the monitor are kinda weird for me.

I have all my audio settings at max. and everything still seems whisper quiet.","Other Thoughts:Overall a good monitor, but if you are looking to purchase this monitor because it has speakers, I wouldn't recommend it because it will be a bitter disappointment and will end up just using your headset :/",0,0

However, this is a minor issue for my use.  No eggs off for that.","Other Thoughts:My company purchased 20 of these units for our computer lab.  We installed a Zotac ID89 computer on to the back of the monitor and hooked up the video with HDMI cable (not included with the monitor).

ASUS,VE248H,5,Good monitors,2013-07-26,"Pros:I've been steadily buying these 1 by 1 over a few months for my eyefinity 5x1p setup. These monitors look great, work great, and most of all have a MATTE FINISH. This is very important to me as I hate glare. The speakers have practically no bass, but whatever they can play sounds very nice. I in fact didn't buy these for the speakers at all, I got the because they had displayport, which is key in eyefinity unless you want to shell out hundreds for adapters.","Cons:Speakers.

Oddly, it did include a VGA and DVI cable. Neither of which do I need.I bought this model specifically because it is HDMI.","Other Thoughts:Normally it's not a big deal, but in this case it made me look bad in front of my client and I had to drive an extra 90 minute round trip to get the cable. I'm now in this monitor another $20. I'm not sure if this was listed or not on the description. It could be my fault for not reading it thoroughly. But still...it should have had one.

But that's not what got this two star rating, I'm upset because after only one year of use, the led backlight has started burning out! It started with the occasional flickering, but now it's color distortion and it can't hold the proper aspect.","Other Thoughts:If a CRT monitor can last me almost 10 years, surely this monitor should have at least last half that time",3,0

It was so bright I had to manually turn down the brightness because it was giving me a head ache.,"Cons:The only downside is when the monitor speakers are turned up all the way they don't sound to good and you can barely hear when they are any lower, but then again, no one expects monitor speakers to be that good.  I am sticking with my desktop speakers and my  Corsair Vengeance 2000 Wireless 7.1 Gaming headset.",Other Thoughts:They could make the markings on the monitor for the buttons a bit lighter and easier to see.  It is kinda small and hard to tell which is which.,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Dead Pixels,2013-07-09,"Pros:Nice looking monitor, very big compared to my last 23 inch. Colors are rich and crisp out of the box, I didn't really have to mess with the settings. Some people were complaining that the base was unstable...I think it's probably their desk thats unstable not the monitor base as it worked fine for me.",Cons:Unfortunately this monitor arrived with two dead pixels in the middle of the screen. This is very irritating considering the fact that I purchased this monitor because the last one had a dead pixel. Now I have to wait for shipping to get it replaced.,Other Thoughts:I'm sure when I get the new one it will be one of the best monitors I have ever owned...until then I'm pretty disappointed with the dead pixels and therefore I give it only 3 eggs.,4,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Nice,2013-07-09,"Pros:This was a move from a 24in model and all I can say is this is a HUGE leap in screen real estate. Much more noticeable than going from 22 to 24 inch. The picture is brilliant, clear, sharp and worth every penny. No dead or stuck pixels.","Cons:Screen adjustment buttons take a few minutes to figure out as there is very little documentation, even on line. But it is doable and after playing around with it for a few minutes, I did come up with a beautiful display that I'm comfortable with.","Other Thoughts:Purchased locally. I guess I'm paranoid about dead pixels and feel more comfortable about returning it if necessary.In any case, you have to remember that at 1920x1080 you're getting the same resolution of a 24 inch unit but with a larger display. This can tend to make the picture a little less sharp. So after setting color, contrast, etc., you really need to tweak the font size and reset ""clear type"" to make reading comfortable and clear. There are enough adjustments that can be made to make this model really ""pop"". Since everyone has a different idea about that they think looks good, it is probably best to play with these functions so you get the picture you like rather than depend on what someone else tells you.",3,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Wish it was better.,2013-07-04,"Pros:Cost, Size and Input Selection are the pros.","Cons:The whites, blacks and overall color falls short compared to other displays. I have two BenQ monitors as a compliment to this monitor and no mater how much I try to adjust the color settings this monitor will never produce the rich dark colors and the bright white colors of my other displays. Blacks are not deep enough and whites come out yellowish or somewhat blue depending on the color temperature you try. I know you will never get an exact match when using two or more displays but these are not even in the same ball park. The other monitors just point out how bad the color is.",Other Thoughts:This was a disappointing purchase for me. I normal like ASUS product. This was my second PC display with them and neither of them made me very happy.

The quality control tech must have fell asleep while this on rolled right on by him on the assembly line.  Newegg has no RMA cross shipping, so that's a huge disappointment also.

The darks are darkers, the colors are fuller, you see every since thing when panning left and right in your favorite FPS. It's great.","Cons:One con though, there's a dead pixel or stuck pixel or whatever that keeps popping up on the middle right of my screen. I applied a little bit of pressure to check if it was just a smudge and it disappeared. Few hours later I notice it again, but once I applied just a tad bit of pressure again it disappears. This concerns me a little because I don't want to be stuck with a monitor with a dead pixel. I wonder how ASUS does their warranty. Maybe I can get this monitor exchanged for one that is properly working without any pixel related problems.","Other Thoughts:Other than that, this monitor is HUGE & great for the price. I really recommend it to anyone who loves gaming, or anything computer related for that monitor. We will have to see how ASUS' customer support is & how they can help me remedy this pixel issue. Hopefully it's a good experience. I will report back how this goes, or even better hopefully an ASUS employee can help me out here.",2,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Good but issues after 6 months,2013-05-22,"Pros:Great picture, variety of inputs, accurate colors and great motion detail, for it's price.  Solid case but plastic. Internal Speakers are decent for VOIP or casual music.","Cons:In dark rooms or at night prepare to be frustrated with button placement and label.  I ad to memorize the buttons because you cannot see past the light and know which label is what. After 6 months, the buttons stopped responding accurately and each one only decreases volume- so it's stuck on one input and cannot get to the OSD menu.",Other Thoughts:No dead pixels which seem to be the  theme if your read other reviews.

I played with settings on the monitors (there are a lot), my video card, and in windows, and couldn't quite get them to match. If the color's right, it's too saturated.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome display! TIPS FOR TUNING HERE!,2013-05-02,"Pros:I've been using an ASUS VH236H for about 5 years, and I freakin love it.  What I realized on my VH236H was that the 'Splendid' mode you chose has a massive impact on the display results, regardless of the brightness/contrast/saturation etc. that you chose.I highly recommend using these settings, been using them on my VH236 all along and after playing with the VE247H settings for about 3 hours I came to the exact same setting being the most pleasing to me:Splendid mode: SCENERYColor settings-Brightness: 100Contrast: 80Saturation: 53Color Temp: User setting, RGB @ 100/100/100Skin tone: NATURALSharpess: 19Trace Free: 0 (this option was not on my VH236, I saw others recommend setting it to 0 to reduce 'ghosting', whatever that is)You may find the colors a bit too poppy/vivid, I set my saturation a little high which compresses the hue values a bit, you can reduce the saturation to make it a bit more ""natural"" without impacting the contrast or value gain much.Admittedly it is quite bright which I consider a PRO not a CON, but if you want to tone it down just reduce the brightness and/or contrast to your liking.","Cons:Why ""splendid""?  Why not call it ""view mode"" or ""display preset"" or something?  That threw me off for a while until I realized what was going on by playing with other settings and switching splendid modes.  I don't like that the spendid mode seems to have an unquantified impact to the user on their display performance - even with all the settings at the same values if you switch between Scenery, Standard, and Theater you can see a huge difference.These other ""splendid"" modes seem to all have extremely high value gain, especially around 0 (black) so everything looks a lot more ""hazy"" (especially Game mode and Night view mode, avoid those at all costs) - this is why I recommend the ""Scenery"" setting - I think it has the most linear value gain and the most ""true"" display representation of the digital image.","Other Thoughts:Aside from lacking intuitive menus, nothing bad to speak of; I have no dead pixels, putting it together took 5 seconds, the speakers are PERFECTLY FINE and very convenient.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Good quality monitor,2013-05-02,"Pros:Good Resolution, good color, decent number of calibration settings (everything you would need, really), and responsive.","Cons:The stand - the tilt could be better, the height is not adjustable, it does not rotate (landscape vs portrait) - you are stuck with landscape position.  This is a drawback as the stand connector that attaches to the monitor doesn't appear to be the standard model, so you would have to go to Asus, most likely, for a stand upgrade if they offer one. I don't care enough to really look for something like that, so you will have to do your own research.I guess it would have been nice if it would go to 2560x1600, but for this price, you won't get that, so I'm not counting it as a con.","Other Thoughts:This is a quality monitor.  If you are on the fence about this one, I have owned this monitor for over a year and have not had any problems with it.

Considering the price with the discount and mail in rebate (which is still annoying), it's a great choice for a TN panel.",Cons:The buttons on the bottom are annoying. The menu is irritating to navigate through. The speakers are about what you would expect from a monitor (i.e. less than great). Buy real speakers or headphones if you actually want sound.,"Other Thoughts:The actual model is nice, but monitors tend to be hit and miss.

I've only had the monitor for about a week, but I'll be sure to update this if anything happens.","Cons:As you may have heard by other reviewers, the screen is way too bright. It's not even an issue of the brightness/contrast settings..or even gamma in color calibration. This screen is incapable of reaching a perfect black. No matter what mode or setting I put it on, it always seems like a dark grey. I have three monitors on my computer. The other two are older VGA models by separate companies. While they're not top-of-line in any sense, they have much better contrast than this monitor. As a visual effects artist/photographer (a poor one at that),  being able to have a good range of colors and contrast is incredibly important.

I have been using the DVI cable and now purchased a HDMI cable. When i plug the HDMI cable in I see green/red/blue pixels shaking on the screen.

Overall very happy with this monitor.,Cons:Not really a con but the volume and brightness buttons were a bit clunky as you have to press the volume down button then press the volume up button to turn the volume up but I use headphones most of the time so not a big deal.,Other Thoughts:Would definitely recommend this to everyone and have thinking of maybe buying another just for my ps3.,0,0

As usual with ASUS, the product is reliable and should last a long time if you take proper care of it.  My vote is buy it - the cons are not a big deal and can probably be remedied by replacing the stand in some way.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Decent monitor. A little too bright.,2013-04-30,"Pros:Great price ($170). Brilliant, crisp color. VGA, DVI and HDMI input options.","Cons:Speakers are absolute garbage. This monitor is intensely bright. I run it at the ""0"" brightness and it's just barely acceptable for me.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2013-04-29,"Pros:This is a good monitor for the price. The picture requires some tweaking out of the box, but I am happy with it after adjustments. The stand is sturdy, and the panel can be tilted, which is nice. Considering the price with the discount and mail in rebate (which is still annoying), it's a great choice for a TN panel.",Cons:The buttons on the bottom are annoying. The menu is irritating to navigate through. The speakers are about what you would expect from a monitor (i.e. less than great). Buy real speakers or headphones if you actually want sound.,"Other Thoughts:The actual model is nice, but monitors tend to be hit and miss. Fortunately, mine came with no dead pixels, which can be a nightmare to deal with. The item was shipped the day I ordered it (Friday), and arrived the following business day (Monday).",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing Monitor,2013-04-29,"Pros:The settings you can choose from very optional and I like options. The screen can be set bright or dark, but the colors can be modified (ex: cool, warm, etc) almost like a TV. Great Refresh Rate if you don't mind 60 FPS. Response time is Just amazing.No dead pixels (Knock on Wood)","Cons:Buttons Kinda suck being on the bottom of the monitor, but aside from that none at this time.","Other Thoughts:If you plan on going beyond 60FPS I would highly recommend getting a 120Hz Refresh Rate. There is screen tearing at around 80FPS, but it wasn't worth knocking an Egg off as most people play at 60FPS",3,0

ASUS,VE248H,2,,2013-04-24,"Pros:Good resolution. Sharp.I haven't had any of the problems a bunch of other people have been mentioning (light bleeding, dead pixels, ghosting, etc) as-of-yet. I've only had the monitor for about a week, but I'll be sure to update this if anything happens.","Cons:As you may have heard by other reviewers, the screen is way too bright. It's not even an issue of the brightness/contrast settings..or even gamma in color calibration. This screen is incapable of reaching a perfect black. No matter what mode or setting I put it on, it always seems like a dark grey. I have three monitors on my computer. The other two are older VGA models by separate companies. While they're not top-of-line in any sense, they have much better contrast than this monitor. As a visual effects artist/photographer (a poor one at that),  being able to have a good range of colors and contrast is incredibly important. This monitor will work for the moment, but I look forward to replacing it in the future with a better one.",,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Asus VE248H,2013-04-24,Pros:Vivid color,Cons:Bought the monitor back in 6/25/11. Had a dead pixel about a week after having it and just lived with it. I have been using the DVI cable and now purchased a HDMI cable. When i plug the HDMI cable in I see green/red/blue pixels shaking on the screen. There is also red lines that shoot across the screen.Im guessing its a bad HDMI port because it is fine when i hook my computer up to a different monitor. My graphics card driver is up to date.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Impressed,2013-04-23,Pros:Ordered Friday morning arrived on Monday 2 days later with the 4+ days shipping (cheapest shipping method). Very nice picture quality and works well with my ps3 and computer (have them both hooked up) Very quickly able to change the input. Overall very happy with this monitor.,Cons:Not really a con but the volume and brightness buttons were a bit clunky as you have to press the volume down button then press the volume up button to turn the volume up but I use headphones most of the time so not a big deal.,Other Thoughts:Would definitely recommend this to everyone and have thinking of maybe buying another just for my ps3.,0,0

When I use the ""anti-ghosting"" controls, it actually got worse than better, so I have that completely turned off which makes the display acceptable.","Other Thoughts:If I had to buy again, I would think twice about this monitor.

I was very tempted to buy two more for surround but... Since I have noticed no 120hz i will probably be selling this and picking up three with 120Hz..

ASUS,VE248H,1,Not Worth The Risk,2013-04-05,Pros:Well... it is big and bright for the money.,"Cons:A few things wrong with my particular unit.Other people on other websites where this monitor is for sale have reported stuck or dead pixels right out of the box. I had one stuck red pixel in the center of the screen from day one.The ""skin tone"" option on my monitor only has ""reddish"" and ""yellowish"" working correctly. The ""natural"" setting is 100% the same as reddish with not a pixel difference. So human skin tones all look yellow or red.This was not acceptable so I RMA the monitor for the stuck pixel and the firmware issue where ""natural"" doesn't function as a skin tone. About two weeks later the status at ASUS's website says ""repaired"" for my monitor. When I got it back the pixel was fixed but not the skin tone option. So I don't know if this is an issue with this model or they just don't want to replace/fix mine. I must use the ""standard mode"" screen setting to get around the redness with all the other modes, however I lose some functionality in standard. I should not have to do this with a new monitor.Another issue with this model is the power adapter is on the inside of the monitor making it needlessly thicker. My older ASUS monitor has it on the outside like most do these days. And the skin tone option works correctly as well. Guess I should have kept that one...","Other Thoughts:If your only looking for a 2ms 27"" screen for cheap and don't care about color accuracy, this will be worth the risk. If dead pixels and a potential high amount of redness do bother you, stay away.And also ASUS's RMA service, after further research has apparently taken a nose dive since about 2010 as I can figure through reading other boards. ASUS claimed in an email to me they could not replicate the issue I was having and wanted more info otherwise they would just return the monitor. Seeing as how your eyes are the only thing needed to see that something was wrong I think that is a tactic they use so they don't have to do anything except send it back to you. I responded to the email and they said they ""repaired"" it, yet clearly they didn't.",1,1

I chose this particular monitor because I wanted something a little bit better but also something somewhat inexpensive. Boy did I get my money's worth from this guy!

As some would say, ""It doesn't make me a sandwhich!"" lol","Other Thoughts:I know some have complained about the speakers, but let's be real for a minute; these are business or ""in a pinch"" speakers. Meaning: They are meant to be used in a tight situation where you can't set up regular PC speakers, or when you need generic sound, and aren't listing to movies or watching TV.I find the built in speakers to be adequate for what they made for.

I just never could get this thing to work right. The picture looked like it had a haze over the screen. All the writing was blurred just a bit. Not enough to be unreadable, but enough that it killed my eyes after an hour or so.  The colors were also quite skewed and I could never get a decent color setting. After reviewing the 1-2 egg reviews, I realized that the problems I was experiencing had been experienced by other purchasers. So I felt less crazy and just sent it back for a refund.","Other Thoughts:Overall, this purchase was a disappointment.

However, the second monitor dead pixel count is too low for a replacement so I just have to live with it?Also, turns out all of the VE247h models have a terrible ghosting issue when you have black text on a white background (like most websites, text documents, etc.). After researching this issue, the only way to really resolve this is to access a hidden menu and mess with a setting that gets erased on a power cycle or when it goes into standby. Afterwards, you have to access the menu again and change the setting again. Every time. This is ridiculous. On top of that, Asus refuses to acknowledge this issue and refuses to help customers who complain it about. The best they do is offer to send a replacement...which also has the same issue since all models have it.

Used my xbox on this monitor for a while and the response time is noticeable compared to bigger tvs. Color is good, and has an easy to use menu.",Cons:1 millisecond response time monitors are now affordable.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Supposed to have speakers,2013-02-27,Pros:Picture is very impressive for a very affordable monitor.,"Cons:These technically have built in speakers, but if I were to plug my earbuds in the PC and set them next to this monitor, I would hear the sound much louder and clearer with my head 2 ft. away.  The speakers are simply and completely unacceptable.  If I wanted a monitor without speakers, I could have saved 20 - 50 bucks.  But I paid that much more and got a monitor without effective speakers.",,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2013-02-25,"Pros:Beautiful color, no noticeable ghosting, super bright.Very good color and brightness settings built in. Between that and W7's color options, I got a great tone.","Cons:Doesn't tilt downward very far and looking at it from lower than straight on looks pretty bad. I like to lay down in bed and watch movies and the really dark blacks start to get ugly from that angle.-You need sunglasses to use it on max brightness.-Makes my 19"" secondary monitor cry itself to sleep from neglect.","Other Thoughts:Overall I'm very happy with it.

ASUS,VE248H,4,"It's Good, but not Great",2013-02-22,"Pros:Like many others have outlined, it has it's flaws. But it's a good monitor for the price, especially since they are usually on sale.",Cons:When I purchased it (early November) newegg was advertising a mail in rebate for this monitor. After I submitted everything (which was a pain in the rear..) I got a response from Asus indicating that the rebate was good until October 31..Who's fault is that? Not sure and not worth the trouble to find out..,,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Really nice monitor,2013-02-17,"Pros:Just a good all-around monitor for gaming, web browsing, web development, etc",Cons:Actually none at all,"Other Thoughts:Buy one if you only need a general monitor, for everyday office use, etc",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,2,Unhappy Buyer,2013-02-14,"Pros:Okay, so I ordered 3 of these monitors.  Every Single one has a dead pixel in it.  Was so excited to get these home and to open them up and play some borderlands 2 on 5760x1080.  Well the first thing I notice is the nice fat dead pixel on the middle monitor, a more subtle dead pixel on the right and the same on the left.  I mean are you serious?? 100% rate for at least one dead pixel on 3 monitors! what gives asus?  I swear by your quality and then this....  I know I am sending at least one back,  maybe, just maybe, I can deal with the two outside monitors.  But I at this point don't want to deal with getting another monitor shipped to me with a dead pixel in it....  I would say the odds are in that favor.  I am debating on sending all 3 back and buying something else at this point.",Cons:3 bought everyone has a dead pixel.....,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,2 DOAs,2013-02-14,"Pros:Quality and color looks terrific. Also, as a fighting game player, it did not show any noticeable input lag. For all other uses, input lag is probably irrelevant.","Cons:Received 2 DOAs in a row, ended up getting a refund. The monitor was unable to tilt and the default angle in which it was shipped in made it practically unusable.","Other Thoughts:Although I received 2 DOAs, Newegg's customer service was superb and made returning the products incredibly fast and easy and this is coming from a first-time returner.",4,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Video Rendering,2013-02-14,Pros:Worked great right out of the box. Simple sleek design and a nice open slot in the stand that allows for easy cable management. The male end of the power cable actually fits through it...I'm using a GeForce GTX570 by ASUS with this monitor and the playback is just fenominal!,Cons:Can't seem to grab the objects out of the monitor...lol!,Other Thoughts:Can't wait to buy another for dual monitors!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Bleeds,2013-02-12,"Pros:LED backlit, good picture quality, decent price for the size,",Cons:My monitor bleeds white on the left and right sides and the bottom bleeds a dark blue/purple that is noticeable when the background is dark.  Really noticeable when crawling dungeons on skyrim.  Looked up the issue and it seems some have had the same problem as well.,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Case,2013-02-12,"Pros:The design is solid, the lights look great, and everything works as It should. Case comes with all the necessities for a new build, and they even include a 2.5"" tray for your hdd/ssd.",Cons:None whatsoever.,"Other Thoughts:If you want a quality product at a fraction of the cost, well then this is the case for you.",1,13
ASUS,VE248H,4,Solid Monitor,2013-02-12,"Pros:Nice clean look, clear, bright, responsive.  Nice color.",Cons:Speakers are straight out the back...,"Other Thoughts:I love the monitor.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Calibration or just a bad monitor?,2013-02-09,"Pros:Price, size, ease of setup","Cons:Quality of display - blacks are greyish, brightness too high, colors look somewhat washed out","Other Thoughts:Various reviews suggest that this monitors requires extensive calibration for best looks. I just want something that works for web browsing and office work (not gaming) - I don't want to spend hours calibrating it. I have now spent almost 2h trying to get it to look as good as my 5yr old Dell 2007WFP and while it looks a lot better than when I started, it's not 100% there. It's not worth it to me to spend even more time trying to calibrate this. Asus / others - can you help by providing me with a set of parameters to use? Otherwise, I am afraid, I will have to RMA this - my first RMA with Newegg/Asus.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,Low Contrast/Saturation - No Customer Support,2013-02-08,Pros:Sturdy.,"Cons:The contrast and/or color saturation is low. It was a touch off from the day I got it, but has become progressively worse. I had tried customer service shortly after i got the monitor, sighting other difficulties. I was told I would receive an e-mail with a form i needed to fill out to get a replacement shipped, however no e-mail ever came and customer support told me that had no clue what I was talking about.Here recently the colors have become more faded. True white doesn't display like the monitor is dim. Black looks under saturated. Objects that should have a dramatic gradient such as from red to black(in the ATI Catalyst Control Center) appear to be one solid color, never the black. I used the online form submission for support about a week ago, but haven't received any response. I love ASUS components, but this has put a bad taste in my mouth for displays. I will probably not buy an ASUS display or something with a display (laptop) again know this is how I will be treated... or rather not treated.",,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,It's dead Jim,2013-02-08,Pros:I can get me money back,Cons:It costs money to move products around the countyThe power light will not even come on.This wastes hours of my time which i  DO value,"Other Thoughts:After having 3 monitors die inside a couple months, I was hoping for a change of luck.

ASUS,VE248H,3,"Good for gaming, photo edit not really",2013-02-08,"Pros:The monitor is good for the price. its 27"", light weight, speaker built in (not best but works), colors and brightness are good. I calibrated with calibration tools and it calibrated fine.  I didn't experience any dead pixels.","Cons:View angle is bad. I edit pictures and you have to make sure your eyes are 90 degrees to screen straight forward. any angle up and down, or side by side will change the tone and colors. This is critical for photo editing.  I'm using the DVI input and my graphics card is Nvidia GTX 670.","Other Thoughts:even thou the spec are good on paper, I'm not real impressed.  I compared to high end Dell and Apple monitor and there is no comparison. BUT, for the price it is good. you will pay $800 plus for the ""high end monitors"" and thats what I might have to do.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Works like a dream!,2013-02-07,"Pros:Bright, crisp picture; multiple display modes.",Cons:It doesn't make me pancakes?,"Other Thoughts:I bought this to replace my old, off-brand 17"" monitor. The difference is like night and day, and the higher resolution especially is a huge improvement - this monitor supports up to 1920x1080 resolution, where I was stuck with 1440x900 on my old monitor. Everything is brighter and cleaner, and gaming especially is more enjoyable. The monitor also offers multiple preset display modes optimized for gaming, nighttime view, watching movies, etc. though I was content with the standard setting. Great product from ASUS!",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Very Pleased,2013-02-07,"Pros:Clear picture, nice design, bright, comprehensive adjustment menu",Cons:Terrible factory calibration,"Other Thoughts:Be prepared to spend a little time adjusting color profiles on the monitor and/or computer.

ASUS,VE248H,4,"Great Picture, Terrible Sound",2013-02-03,Pros:* Great full HD picture* Simple interface (buttons)* Low profile (doesn't take up too much space)* Includes cables!!!!,"Cons:THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE. I bought this after reading the reviews thinking, ""... oh, these are just people who care a lot about sound."" No, I had this thing replaced thinking there was something wrong, but that's just how it was. The sound at full volume is no better than a high-end cell phone in 2011.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great For Console Gaming!,2013-02-03,"Pros:I received this monitor as a gift for the holidays and have been using it as a console gaming monitor, and it will be reviewed as such.-No noticeable input lag, feels similar to when I play on my 32"" CRT.-No ghosting.-No Backlight Bleed.-Great colors (see con)-Amazing connectivity.-Good response time.","Cons:-You have to play in Scenery or Theater to get good color reproduction, off of out of the box modes.","Other Thoughts:I've played on this with an Xbox 360 over both VGA and HDMI. Didn't see a difference in anything (other than color reproduction) between the two. I've played mostly shooters (Call of Duty, Halo, etc.) but have played a variety of other games as well (Skyrim, Star Wars The Force Unleashed, etc.) and this monitor made them look wonderful.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,don't buy,2013-02-02,"Pros:specs sounded very good, warranty too until",Cons:asus replacement policies means you have to pay for shipping of  their  defect product on your dime.

ASUS,VE248H,3,VE248H,2013-02-02,"Pros:Picture, connections","Cons:HDMI connection signal kept going out.  Just sent it in under warranty in Dec and here it is Feb and it's back out again.  Have a nice blue screen with ""No HDMI Signal"" before it goes to black.  Now they cross ship you a different monitor.  Mine I have to send in and wait.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2013-02-02,"Pros:Full HD, No issues with refresh on SCII or D3, nice to have built in speakers (will worry about dedicated sound at a later point), some flickering but it's likely due to the budget HDMI cable I am using",Cons:The monitor is not height adjustable (knew at time of purchase so not going to dock an egg),Other Thoughts:i5 3750k Ivy BridgeMSI Z77A-GD55G.Skill Ares Series 8 GB RAMSeaSonic G Series 550W PSUEVGA Superclocked GeForce GTX 660 2 GBIntel 330 Series SSD,2,0

It was not a big deal for most of the computers here, but one of the users really needed them - couldn't install the monitor for him until working this around.Included cables could be longer - sometimes one must go around desk corners etc.","Other Thoughts:We got initially one to evaluate, then ordered more after being confident about performance & quality. New to the ASUS brand for monitors, surely we'll stick on it.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Product,2013-01-30,"Pros:Good Display, high resolution. Looks very nice. Also is very lightweight and easy to adjust.I like the fact that they came with speakers built in, I wasn't looking for much other than a little bit of sound. My current desk set up is quite small and does not allow for too many periphrials.The glossy black frame also looks very nice, but it does streak when touched.","Cons:Speakers aren't the best when turned up, but I wasn't looking for much. They come turned down to 50% by default, which made them appear very quiet, but after turning up the volume, I didn't like the sound quality as much so it is better to keep them around the 60-65% range I think. They definitely get the job done.","Other Thoughts:A great buy, hopefully my rebate will come through.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Screen (Do Not Buy for Speakers),2013-01-28,Pros:Bought 2 screens no dead pixels or other problems.  Image colors are deep and image is crisp.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Will never buy an asus monitor again,2013-01-28,Pros:Had nice colors,Cons:Died in less then a year,Other Thoughts:I bought an Asus VE247H back in February 2012 and it died in January 2013. Due to a dead fuse.A DEAD FUSE.Will never buy an asus monitor again.,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Works great,2013-01-27,"Pros:Easy set up with HDMI. Built-in speakers sound pretty good. Crisp clean screen, HD looks great on it.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent,2013-01-27,"Pros:Great picture, purchased two of these and one of the VK's (has camera) to use for an eyefinity setup.  Outstanding performance for gaming, and for coding. I will be using these until they die.  Hopefully that will not be anytime soon.  Great price",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:The default input is set to VGA.  This unit will not auto detect what you plug into it.  You must select the input by pressing the button next to the power button - i.e. I am using the DisplayPort input; so I had to toggle thru HDMI, DVI and VGA to get to DisplayPort.  Pretty easy.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2013-01-26,"Pros:No dead pixels, no stuck pixels, no nonsense. The base was easy to attach, it pivots to the angle that I need it to. It looks good in action as well.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Get one without speakers if you don't need them and save some money.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Disappointing in the end,2013-01-24,"Pros:Very good picture quality, attractive bezel & base design, very good price for size and LED backlit LCD type",Cons:One stuck pixel on first use and throughout life of monitor,"Other Thoughts:I purchased the monitor during a good sale, so the value was excellent. Upon unboxing I noticed no signs of tampering. However, the screw that holds the base to the rest of the stand would not screw in. I looked closely at the threads on the stand and saw slight signs of damage, but nothing serious. I looked closely at the first thread of the special mounting screw and noticed that the cut was not good. The screw appeared to be the problem. At the time I thought I would work on the threads or possibly find another mounting screw at a later date. Annoying, but no big deal. The monitor will stand normally without the base being fixed to the stand so I began using the monitor. The stuck pixel was annoying, but I don't like the idea of trying to RMA a monitor over one stuck pixel.I continued to use the monitor for about 7 months, ignoring the stuck pixel. Apparently I bumped my desk and the monitor tipped over towards me onto a hard object on my desk. The display did not survive.A normally functioning version of this monitor would receive 5 eggs. I removed one egg for the dead pixel and one egg for the faulty screw. I bought a name brand display hoping to avoid things like this. Even the best companies aren't perfect.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,I Love this Monitor,2013-01-24,"Pros:Absolutely beautiful image quality. I ended up buying two of these monitors because I love the quality they produce. I currently have 1 Monitor used for gaming, and the second I use for Netflix/web browsing. The difference in video was like night and day. I'm very happy with this product.",Cons:None so far.,"Other Thoughts:If you are thinking about purchasing this monitor, then you should. The LED backlit provides a bright, crystal clear image quality and watching videos makes it worth every penny spent.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great upgrade!,2013-01-23,Pros:Upgraded from a standard 23'' lcd. Colors are vivd and the led backlight is perfect. No dead pixels as of yet.

They supply a converter cable, which works fine.","Other Thoughts:Some video cards don't default to HDMI enabled, so you may have to use the converter cable or VGA to get a new computer loaded up the first time.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Not convinced,2013-01-20,"Pros:Affordable, Big, Sturdy, 4 inputs, fits perfectly on the back of my Desk, width wise.","Cons:Poor Colors, so bright and that adjusting levels and Contrast and Brightness, leave me wanting more. It all looks washed out when dealing with grays. It also appears to be affecting light Blues as well. I fly flight sims and its leaving a gradient rings from the sun in the clear blue sky. I have a GTX660ti FTW and its displays the sky, and grays perfectly on an Old VeiwSonic 19"" CRT and an Old 17"" HPL1706 flat panel. I've already sent in for an RMA on a return, $44.25 plus shipping is a pretty big hit on $300 monitor, but am thinking more and more it may just be a bad product. Once I get home I'm contacting ASUS and see if they have any suggestions, before I recontact and mail it back to NewEgg. I'm also wondering if the ASUS VS278Q-P with the 80000000:1 would fix this complaint since this one has 10000000:1 If Asus points that direction, then I'll approach Newegg on charging me the difference and swapping it out. As for the added weight of the speakers, just as soon not have them, I thought they might at the least work as dedicated set for  Teamspeak, but they failed to perform that simple task.",Other Thoughts:Had to stack up six Old BassPro Catalogs to center it up to eye level.,1,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,I like it,2013-01-20,Pros:So far I have to say this is a great monitor and I have had no problems what so ever with it. I have read a lot of reviews that say it has ghosting and bad viewing angles and I have not had that problem what so ever. In fact I'm getting two more to have a 3 monitor set up.,Cons:The only con I can see is you cant turn the monitor so that you can view it up and down and not the way it is set up now,Other Thoughts:Having 60hz isn't to bad because most people cant see the difference between this monitor or a 120hz one. I have looked at the different ones in the store and I cant see it at all.,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Displays text and images that are easy on the eyes,2013-01-15,Pros:Very sharp and seems to be free of the ghosting that my two VE248s have (purchased in 2010 and 2011).The out-of-the box colors were also much better than the vintage VE248s.I like the matte screen finish because I work near windows.,"Cons:Speakers are weak but, if you've read any other reviews, you already know that.",Other Thoughts:I also use three Dell Ultra Sharp monitors with IPS panels. I think this monitor displays text just as well as they do.,0,0

This is only an issue if you want to switch back and forth between your TV Tuner and your PC input. I improvised a work -around by running the VGA connection to an old ViewSonic Tuner I had and then using the remote through the Tuner.,"Other Thoughts:ASUS is on top (for now) in terms of Monitors and MotherBoards.

Perfect for multi-use setup with 2x hdmi and D-sub (I have it as my main monitor on PC, an extended monitor for my laptop, and a Xbox 360 hooked into it).

Also is very lightweight and easy to adjust.I like the fact that they came with speakers built in, I wasn't looking for much other than a little bit of sound. My current desk set up is quite small and does not allow for too many periphrials.The glossy black frame also looks very nice, but it does streak when touched.","Cons:Speakers aren't the best when turned up, but I wasn't looking for much. They come turned down to 50% by default, which made them appear very quiet, but after turning up the volume, I didn't like the sound quality as much so it is better to keep them around the 60-65% range I think. They definitely get the job done.","Other Thoughts:A great buy, hopefully my rebate will come through.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Screen (Do Not Buy for Speakers),2013-01-28,Pros:Bought 2 screens no dead pixels or other problems.  Image colors are deep and image is crisp.  Would recommend these monitors to anyone who needs monitors.,Cons:The speakers are terrible but you should not buy a monitor based on its speakers.,,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Will never buy an asus monitor again,2013-01-28,Pros:Had nice colors,Cons:Died in less then a year,Other Thoughts:I bought an Asus VE247H back in February 2012 and it died in January 2013. Due to a dead fuse.A DEAD FUSE.Will never buy an asus monitor again.,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Works great,2013-01-27,"Pros:Easy set up with HDMI. Built-in speakers sound pretty good. Crisp clean screen, HD looks great on it. One bright pixel upon arrival, hence the one egg ding.",Cons:Cost. Not being used to its full potential.,Other Thoughts:Destined for elderly parents the one bad pixel was not an issue.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent,2013-01-27,"Pros:Great picture, purchased two of these and one of the VK's (has camera) to use for an eyefinity setup.  Outstanding performance for gaming, and for coding. I will be using these until they die.  Hopefully that will not be anytime soon.  Great price",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:The default input is set to VGA.  This unit will not auto detect what you plug into it.  You must select the input by pressing the button next to the power button - i.e. I am using the DisplayPort input; so I had to toggle thru HDMI, DVI and VGA to get to DisplayPort.  Pretty easy.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2013-01-26,"Pros:No dead pixels, no stuck pixels, no nonsense. The base was easy to attach, it pivots to the angle that I need it to. It looks good in action as well.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Get one without speakers if you don't need them and save some money.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Disappointing in the end,2013-01-24,"Pros:Very good picture quality, attractive bezel & base design, very good price for size and LED backlit LCD type",Cons:One stuck pixel on first use and throughout life of monitor,"Other Thoughts:I purchased the monitor during a good sale, so the value was excellent. Upon unboxing I noticed no signs of tampering. However, the screw that holds the base to the rest of the stand would not screw in. I looked closely at the threads on the stand and saw slight signs of damage, but nothing serious. I looked closely at the first thread of the special mounting screw and noticed that the cut was not good. The screw appeared to be the problem. At the time I thought I would work on the threads or possibly find another mounting screw at a later date. Annoying, but no big deal. The monitor will stand normally without the base being fixed to the stand so I began using the monitor. The stuck pixel was annoying, but I don't like the idea of trying to RMA a monitor over one stuck pixel.I continued to use the monitor for about 7 months, ignoring the stuck pixel. Apparently I bumped my desk and the monitor tipped over towards me onto a hard object on my desk. The display did not survive.A normally functioning version of this monitor would receive 5 eggs. I removed one egg for the dead pixel and one egg for the faulty screw. I bought a name brand display hoping to avoid things like this. Even the best companies aren't perfect.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,I Love this Monitor,2013-01-24,"Pros:Absolutely beautiful image quality. I ended up buying two of these monitors because I love the quality they produce. I currently have 1 Monitor used for gaming, and the second I use for Netflix/web browsing. The difference in video was like night and day. I'm very happy with this product.",Cons:None so far.,"Other Thoughts:If you are thinking about purchasing this monitor, then you should. The LED backlit provides a bright, crystal clear image quality and watching videos makes it worth every penny spent.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great upgrade!,2013-01-23,Pros:Upgraded from a standard 23'' lcd. Colors are vivd and the led backlight is perfect. No dead pixels as of yet. Monitor is pricey but it is worth every cent.,Cons:NONE,Other Thoughts:A little upset that UPS delivered it without requiring a signature. Monitor was sitting outside for 2 hours in -5 degree weather.,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Big, Bright and Beautiful!",2013-01-21,"Pros:Big, Bright and Beautiful!","Cons:No DVI built in. They supply a converter cable, which works fine.","Other Thoughts:Some video cards don't default to HDMI enabled, so you may have to use the converter cable or VGA to get a new computer loaded up the first time.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Not convinced,2013-01-20,"Pros:Affordable, Big, Sturdy, 4 inputs, fits perfectly on the back of my Desk, width wise.","Cons:Poor Colors, so bright and that adjusting levels and Contrast and Brightness, leave me wanting more. It all looks washed out when dealing with grays. It also appears to be affecting light Blues as well. I fly flight sims and its leaving a gradient rings from the sun in the clear blue sky. I have a GTX660ti FTW and its displays the sky, and grays perfectly on an Old VeiwSonic 19"" CRT and an Old 17"" HPL1706 flat panel. I've already sent in for an RMA on a return, $44.25 plus shipping is a pretty big hit on $300 monitor, but am thinking more and more it may just be a bad product. Once I get home I'm contacting ASUS and see if they have any suggestions, before I recontact and mail it back to NewEgg. I'm also wondering if the ASUS VS278Q-P with the 80000000:1 would fix this complaint since this one has 10000000:1 If Asus points that direction, then I'll approach Newegg on charging me the difference and swapping it out. As for the added weight of the speakers, just as soon not have them, I thought they might at the least work as dedicated set for  Teamspeak, but they failed to perform that simple task.",Other Thoughts:Had to stack up six Old BassPro Catalogs to center it up to eye level.,1,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,I like it,2013-01-20,Pros:So far I have to say this is a great monitor and I have had no problems what so ever with it. I have read a lot of reviews that say it has ghosting and bad viewing angles and I have not had that problem what so ever. In fact I'm getting two more to have a 3 monitor set up.,Cons:The only con I can see is you cant turn the monitor so that you can view it up and down and not the way it is set up now,Other Thoughts:Having 60hz isn't to bad because most people cant see the difference between this monitor or a 120hz one. I have looked at the different ones in the store and I cant see it at all.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,and now i have three,2013-01-19,Pros:colors are nicelow cost for 1080pjust the right sizeworks right out of the box,"Cons:i bought one, then a year later i bought 2 more and hooked them up in eyefinity. i bought the same model so the colors would be the same however the colors dont match completely. even the menus are different.",Other Thoughts:even though the colors dont match the older monitor exactly they still look very nice for a tn monitor. eyefinity is very nice with 3 of these. if your looking for a cheap 1080 monitor then this is it. if your looking for a cheap 1080 eyefinity set up then look no further.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Displays text and images that are easy on the eyes,2013-01-15,Pros:Very sharp and seems to be free of the ghosting that my two VE248s have (purchased in 2010 and 2011).The out-of-the box colors were also much better than the vintage VE248s.I like the matte screen finish because I work near windows.,"Cons:Speakers are weak but, if you've read any other reviews, you already know that.",Other Thoughts:I also use three Dell Ultra Sharp monitors with IPS panels. I think this monitor displays text just as well as they do.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Gave it a shot,2013-01-15,Pros:Pros: Newegg is awesome. Box and physical hardware did not appear to be damaged.Looks great powered off.,Cons:Cons: Can see the LED back-light on the top and left edge of the display.Multiple pixels stuck in Red in the mid to lower right side of the display.Also had a wave in what was suppose to be a straight top edge of the display area.Confirmed Ghosting.,Other Thoughts:Other Thoughts: Is a monitor suppose to look better with DVI compared to HDMI cable?RMA'd monitor and buying a Samsung. I like the ASUS motherboards and laptops. Thought the monitor would be better. Perhaps I received a lemon.,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,Junk,2013-01-13,Pros:Nice looking,"Cons:Made from very cheap materials, Stopped working after 1 month. Sent in for RMA and it was in perfect cosmedic condition we never touched this monitor other than ouboxing it and sending in screen for repair. It come beck from repair seems to work ok. But it looks like we bought it fron the junk yard. Its so scratched up from the repir center I dont even want the junk. I would not recommend ASUS to anyone. They ignore my emails and wont address the problem. I own many ASUS products and will never purchace anything else made by them.",,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Nice,2013-01-13,"Pros:Does what it should,Good, Reliable 1080p monitor","Cons:Built in speakers are OK, but I usually just use headphones anyway.....","Other Thoughts:If you don't need anything Super Awesome, just something for Working and Gaming, then this is a good choice!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Good monitors, colors a bit washed at times",2013-01-12,"Pros:Inexpensive, inputs, resolution, size",Cons:Colors and built in speakers,"Other Thoughts:Built in speakers aren't good at all, tin can sounding. I'm spoiled by Samsung contrast ratios and color, these look a bit washed but they get the job done. No dead or stuck pixels.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2013-01-12,"Pros:Very good image quality, fast response time, easy to configure",Cons:Built-in speaker quality is what you'd expect,,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Outstanding Monitor,2013-01-12,"Pros:Wall mountable VESA (100 x 100) was able to replace my 18.5"" Acer monitor.Speakers (not really necessary though)2 HDMI Connectors.Clear, crisp picture (LED)I was able to effectively turn this monitor into an HDTV by connecting the HDMI cable directly to my set top box.",Cons:Lack of a remote. This is only an issue if you want to switch back and forth between your TV Tuner and your PC input. I improvised a work -around by running the VGA connection to an old ViewSonic Tuner I had and then using the remote through the Tuner.,"Other Thoughts:ASUS is on top (for now) in terms of Monitors and MotherBoards. But things can change very quickly. I had to cancel a similar ASUS 27"" when I was able to figure out it was non-mountable on the wall. You want to have this VESA mountable option to save desk real estate.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Welcome to pixel heaven,2013-01-11,"Pros:2x HDMI inputs, 27 inch LED, built-in speakers",Cons:A button dedicated to just switching inputs would have been nice while running multiple systems at once.,"Other Thoughts:Amazing monitor for the price. Perfect for multi-use setup with 2x hdmi and D-sub (I have it as my main monitor on PC, an extended monitor for my laptop, and a Xbox 360 hooked into it). For only being 3W RMS I think the speakers sound great. It takes a few minutes to setup the adjustments, but after that most changes can be made quickly. Mine had no dead or stuck pixels either.",4,0

ASUS,VE248H,2,Speakers DOA,2013-01-10,Pros:Bright and beautiful screen. Good Price.,Cons:Sound did not work at all. Buttons for adjustment on bottom made for a PITA set up.,Other Thoughts:Returned to Newegg. Waiting on a replacement. Should be here tomorrow.,4,2
ASUS,VE248H,1,Dead pixels...,2013-01-10,"Pros:Nice monitor, quality built, very nice colors and great features...","Cons:Monitor showed up brand new, but it has 5 dead pixels... would rate this higher, but it gets 1 egg for now for having to RMA and ship it back/wait for a new one... what a pain.  Been using ASUS monitors for awhile without any issues until this one.  Hopefully I don't get a refurbished one...",,1,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,Dead Pixel,2013-01-08,Pros:- Great quality- Awesome colors,Cons:- Dead pixel within 35 days of use. Very disappointed.,Other Thoughts:Wish the dead pixel would have appeared earlier so I could get an RMA.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Love it,2013-01-07,"Pros:Looks amazing, plays games amazing. Its nice to have Dual monitors that match for the first time in my life.Its got wonderful color, and is all I need for most of my web browsing and now that Im getting back into gaming its perfect.",Cons:None.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great Upgrade,2013-01-06,Pros:Amazing picture. Got this for 55% off on a 1 time deal. Its my first flat screen and very pleased. Almost to big... Upgraded from and old monster 20 inch sony CRT. Splendid is a nice feature.VGA DVI works good but forgot to get a HDMI cable. If thats going to be even better i cant wait. Gaming is great on this.,Cons:Menu is a pain. Speakers are not great but most suck anyway. Using as a center channel on a few thing works OK.,"Other Thoughts:Look like the price went up again, Still worth it.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Decent monitor for the price,2013-01-06,Pros:Large bright screen for a reasonable price.  I run my laptop off the DVI and my Xbox 360 off the HDMI.  Both look great on this screen.,Cons:One dead pixel.  Button placement is awkward but not the end of the world.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2013-01-05,"Pros:Clean, crisp picture and no dead or stuck pixels.  Comes with cables.  Speakers are not too bad... I use them for sound from my secondary computer.","Cons:On a dark screen, there is a glow across the bottom of the screen like something you would see with CCFL (except this is LED back lit).  When you power it on, there is an Asus splash screen and monitor is a bit slow to bring up your picture.   There is no power indicator to distinguish between power saving modes and power off.  Screen can not be tilted.","Other Thoughts:There's a few annoyances, but still 5 eggs.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Works well,2013-01-05,"Pros:It works fine, games look very good (except for minecraft without optifine)",Cons:Viewing angle,Other Thoughts:The viewing angle isn't really a problem for me because I sit directly in front of a single monitor. Not worth deducting a full egg.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor but.....,2013-01-05,"Pros:This monitor looks amazing! and coming from a Laptop monitor it definitely is a great upgrade. The image, the colors and the size is just sweet. Very Crisp and vivid.","Cons:Like one  of the reviews said, If you want to get a monitor for gaming then don't get this. What I didn't know when I got this monitor was that  I  would have to enable Vsync to play any game that goes well over 60 Frames per Second so I wouldn't have screen tearing. Because the monitor only has 60hz refresh rate, and any Frames Per Second that goes over that you will start noticing screen tearing, because the monitor can't keep up with the higher frames. But that's my fault for not checking into it before I bought it. So it snot really a con, no eggs taken off.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is great, I'm not going to take any eggs off because of something I didn't pay attention to before buying and that was my fault. I'm going to keep it for my other computer. My friend recommended Asus VG series which have higher Refresh rate, and are made more for gamers. So I'm probably going to get Asus VG278HE. I like Asus, I just should have done research before buying.No regrets though, but if you are in the market for a nice looking monitor, then this the one for you. Asus hasn't failed me yet.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor,2013-01-05,Pros:-Looks great-Strong base-2ms response for gaming,Cons:4 stars because of 1 dead pixel on the left side of the screen.,"Other Thoughts:The base doesn't swivel left and right, just up and down.  Not really that important.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Thumbs up.,2013-01-04,Pros:Picture its great. I have two of them both running through DVI. Colors are very rich. Did a quick round of a couple different games after I set them up and had no problems. No dead pixels is also a plus. Monitors are also quite light at least more so than what I was expecting.,Cons:The power/dvi cables that came with the monitors are really short.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,,2013-01-03,Pros:Cheap,Cons:Tried to order this monitor twice. First time it arrived it had a dead pixel right in the middle of the screen. Didn't get too upset requested an RMA and when the new one came it also had a dead pixel. Returned the monitor again and asked for a refund.,"Other Thoughts:Don't usually give negative reviews for broken on arrival products but two in a row with the same problem is ridiculous. Never purchasing another ASUS monitor again, especially online.",1,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,Best Monitor Ever owned,2013-01-02,Pros:Best brightess pictures from any monitor I have ever seen. Not one dead or bad pixel. The monitor looks good is a simple functional design that has a very good tilt angle if needed. No heat from the screen which means lower energy use.,Cons:Not easy to find unlike it's more expensive slightly lower spec brother VE278Q.,"Other Thoughts:This is a much better buy than the VE278Q, the price is lower specs better 5x for contrast. The Q does have PIP, not sure how that is useful on a computer moniter yet.Controls just take a moment to figure out, not hard just different than some other brands out there.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2013-01-02,"Pros:Great monitor. 27 inches, LED, 1920x1080 resolution.","Cons:One stuck pixel that's green in the lower left, only comes up when the screen is black for some reason. It doesn't really annoy me though, so I didn't dock an egg.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Slight Issue,2013-01-01,Pros:none,"Cons:The Monitor does this wierd thing where when you turn on the computer you cant see any video untill you get to the login, probably the MOST annoying thing i have every experienced in my life. Yes i've tried this on other computers as well and a PS3. Also, the video display is horrible, VERY whitewashed. I dont know if i have a defective monitor, but it took me a couple months to realize somethings wrong. Please Refund or send me a new one.",,1,4
ASUS,VE248H,1,Good in a certain situation.,2012-12-31,"Pros:Crisp view, 1920 x 1080 resolution.  Cheap, and may be good if you can position it right for the correct color, terrible for duel monitors.","Cons:First day, I was excited, pumped to get two 1920x1080 monitors, it's been so long!  Second day, I noticed something, the left monitor is a yellow tint, and the right is a blue tint.  After 4 days of trying to adjust, I noticed it's the angle giving the monitors a different tint.  And soon after, I noticed the backlight bleeding on both.  Nasty bright blue colors growing from the sides.  The power cords. . . A little adjustment and the monitors shut off.  I was so optimistic about this, but it's disappointing.  As a 3D animator, and editor, I really need precise colors, and the way I'm positioned, it's hard to get the perfect angle so the monitors don't tune to a terrible tint.  I'm convinced that this certain model is naturally like this, because both the monitors have the same issue.","Other Thoughts:I'm trying to get a refund currently, if possible.  I'm almost positive I'll run into the same issues with replacement models.  I'm just hoping ASUS won't be stubborn about it.  I plan to buy a higher up model from them.  Maybe, depending on the reviews.  I'm just so disapointed",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,MEH,2012-12-29,Pros:Its very bright and whiter than my old display.,Cons:Any dark text not on a while background leaves a white halo when scrolling. I can only speculate why. This was the first thing I noticed after swapping displays. Its very visually annoying and all I can see now when I look at web pages. I may resell this to someone else. I don't think I can cope with it.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,No Problems,2012-12-29,Pros:Great monitor. Has great picture and potential for high resolution.,Cons:Nope,Other Thoughts:I would buy it again and again. Bought it to replace an Acer monitor that broke after a couple months.,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Works well.  Speakers broken.,2012-12-29,Pros:Great picture.  It makes my Samsung SyncMaster SA550 looked a bit washed out.  Does everything I expected it to do.  It came less than 48 hours after I ordered it when I did three day shipping.,"Cons:The built in speakers are non-functioning. As usual, the Asus tech support is awful.  I attempted to call Asus tech support but waited on hold for 15 minutes or so and was accidentally connected to someones desk phone.  Come on Asus.  I ultimately gave up.  I ended up using my Sony sound bar and receiver over optical audio. It works well, but it's still an annoyance that the speakers don't work.",,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Works good,2012-12-27,Pros:HDMI and speakers. Thin and light.,Cons:Buttons and power light are hard to see. They are on the bottom edge of the monitor.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Flawless,2012-12-27,"Pros:-Vibrant colors-A plethora of settings-Solid stand-Huge!-Thin and minimalistic design keep it light and sleek-VESA compatible-2 HD ports for dual monitors-No dead pixels!Came out of the box working great. You get a dual-link D-sub and a 3.5mm to 3.5mm audio cable in the box. Stand is extremely easy to attach and stays on comfortably. Monitor settings are intuitive and allow you deep customization. Blacks, which many people seem to care a lot about, are dark and just right.","Cons:-Glossy finish, while nice, holds fingerprints-Color settings, such as saturation, needs to be adjusted out of the box. Typical, but the colors seem to be really off, more than they should be.These are minor concerns, and in no way take away from the performance of the monitor. Don't touch it once it's in place and fiddle with those settings right away, it will come to life!","Other Thoughts:Monitor has built in speakers, but I didn't test those at all. Don't expect them to be great quality. Why are you buying a 27"" LED display and using built in speakers?!",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,COMPENSATION? I THINK NOT,2012-12-26,"Pros:This thing is sweet. No issues with moderately heavy use for a few months. The screen is bright and the color is vivid. Compared to my old LCD monitor, its incredible.One of the nicest features is the power LED being on the bottom of the monitor. It isnt mounted on the front like my old LCD, so my retinas arent being murdered by the piercing blue beams of light.Its the little things that make me happy.","Cons:I understand LEDs are brighter than LCDs, but this monitor's brightness ranges from bright (low) to all-consuming light of 1000 suns (high).It took a bit of getting used to, but now it's not so bad when turned all the way down.Another con that isnt mentioned involves the picture-in-picture feature. I didnt buy my monitor intending to use the feature, but once I discovered it, I figured I'd give it a shot. I have my PC as well as my PS3 connected, and figured I could have the PIP activated instead of having to swtich between the two channels manually. Apparently, this monitor doesnt support DVI (my PC) to HDMI (my PS3) when trying to use PIP.Again, it wasnt a huge bother to me, just didnt make much sense why it wouldnt work with that specific setup.","Other Thoughts:Overall, best monitor I've ever had. Good functionality for multiple devices. Picture is sharp, clean, and doesnt have a single dead pixel.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Simply Amazing,2012-12-21,"Pros:I myself finally took the plungle & decided to get the monitor I truly wanted(almost settled for a 24""). After upgrading from my 22"" Asus, I can truly say I am so truly amazed. No picture can truly describe how large this monitor really is, makes my old 22"" look so tiny. The colors are very vibrant, the darks are dark, and brights are bright. The stant seems to be plenty steady unlike many other available options. Best of all NOT a single dead pixle!! I truly couldn't be more happy.","Cons:Only thing that comes close to a con is the fact 24"" monitors are rocking 1920x1080, it would make more sense to see 1920x1200 ATLEAST. But again this really isn't a major con.","Other Thoughts:The past 3 monitors I have owned have all been Asus brand, and I could not be happier(looks like the can do more then solid motherboards afterall lol) I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone looking for something larger then a 24"".",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Not bad, not great, Newegg rocks!",2012-12-20,"Pros:Great clear picture, fantastic for gaming and I would highly recommend for this purpose. Overall a great monitor for the price. One of the few monitor options you have when you need a DVI and a HDMI connection (PC and PS3).","Cons:Color representation is not great in some scenarios as others have listed. Text can be a blurry at times. Grays seem almost pixelated on some web pages, but overall not horrible.Biggest Con: dead pixel upon arrival. Yes only one but I'm very picky about this, I can spot a piece of dust on my screen a mile away, and in my opinion with the amount of flat panel production taking place, there is no reason for this. I've purchased several laptops and monitors and this is the first time I've had this happen, but this is also my first Asus monitor so a bit disappointed by that. Seems like something QC should catch. Due to this I've RMA'd and Newegg's wonderful customer service immediately resolved the issue. Will review again when replacement arrives","Other Thoughts:Overall for the price this monitor is a good buy, especially for gaming, but as others have stated, they do have their issues and you may be one of us unlucky ones who have to RMA to get a good product, but I feel in the end it will be worth it for the price.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,MY EYES ARE DROOLING!,2012-12-19,Pros:Everything. Monitor is high quality like all asus stuff. It looks soooooooo nice. I tried on both ps3 and my hd radeon 7950 gaming pc. It is so nice. No dead pixels (is that even a common issue?) Second asus monitor at home. LOVE THEM. BUY THIS ITS THE CHEAPEST AND BEST VALUE ASUS 27 INCH MONITOR.,Cons:PEOPLE THAT DONT GIVE THIS 5 EGGS:  I dont understand why people complain about stupid stuff like presets being useless. I mean WHO CARES. its an added bonus and if you're not lazy you can always optimize settings and look up online for best settings.2. I guess sound is not best.

ASUS,VE248H,3,"Decent monitor, backlight bleeding, not very rich black colors",2012-12-19,"Pros:Colors look pretty goodA few presets as well as user adjustable RGB, brightness and contrast valuesWas on saleHas HDMI, which is nice","Cons:Backlight bleeding. This has been an issue with literally every Asus product I've ever owned (or tried to own but got fed up and stopped buying their sub-par products). I once went through about 10 Transformer Pads before completely giving up because every one of them had horrible backlight bleeding issues. This monitor isn't too awful, but there is one very noticeable spot.Sometimes it's hard to find a good setting. I found myself messing around with the presets for a while before settling on something.Speakers sound terrible. I'm not even going to try to make excuses for it because they're built-in, because some all-in-one PC's and higher end monitors have excellent speakers.","Other Thoughts:You know what they say: You get what you pay for.This monitor must have been on sale for a reason.I'm not sure if I want to deal with sending this monitor back for a replacement. If I'm forced to get another of the same model, there's a very good chance I'll end up with one that has even worse light bleeding issues. If I can go for another brand, however, then I might just do that.If I can edit this review in the future, I'll do that and probably post a video to show the backlight bleeding.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Asus always quality,2012-12-18,"Pros:All the recent monitors I've bought have been Asus.  Quality like their mobos.  Well packed, easy setup, plenty of settings to view as you like.  Never had a dead pixel with this or any others.",Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:The settings buttons on the bottom are small, almost like the thing needs a remote, but with patience they work.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,TERRIBLE,2012-12-16,"Pros:Cheap, it works, low input lag","Cons:HORRIBLE image quality. I went from a 19"" Hanns G monitor to this and I thought it would be an improvement. No, it's the same horrible image quality. All the colors are dull and washed up. Whites look dirty. Can't calibrate this thing to save my life.","Other Thoughts:If someone can help me calibrate this thing, please do so. I've owned it for 4 months and I still haven't been able to calibrate it so it looks good. But I don't think it's a calibration issue, I've been reading that ASUS displays have washed up colors.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Nice 27"" Monitor",2012-12-15,"Pros:Love the look of this monitor, no dead pixels on arrival booted right up and hardly had to make any changes to the settings, pretty much auto detected optimal settings, however there are presets that help decide what looks best to you.  Couldnt ask for more out of this monitor, the picture is awesome!","Cons:The buttons to change the monitor settings are a little tough to figure out, havent had to use them much anyway. Small con but hardly an issue at all.","Other Thoughts:Great price, great looking monitor, if you think its bright its probably because its a 27"" monitor and you shouldnt sit so close.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Respectable Monitor,2012-12-13,"Pros:Adequate brightness, good color, generous inputs and decent speakers built in.","Cons:After working with side by side documents, having a 2560 x 1440 would make more sense.  This is because 2560 is exactly double the pixel count of most 19"" monitors out there.  A page fits nice width wide on a 1280 wide monitor, but on a 1920 wide monitor, webpages and other windows don't fit without scaling.  Really minor and not the fault of this monitor.  Just something to think about when you are researching monitors.","Other Thoughts:This is not a con to this specific monitor, but I liked the days when most monitors came with height adjustments at decent prices.  This monitor is too low on a normal desk and requires a booster seat to get to proper eye level for me and the wife.",0,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,BUY IT!,2012-12-13,"Pros:The picture and sound are very good quality. Of the several flat panel w/ speakers built in, this is by far the best gaming monitor I have seen.","Cons:I do not like that you can not use the headphone jack on the back with the HDMI plugged in, and you cant use the speakers if the headphones are plugged in... it is one sound option at a time. The options/menu keys are a slight pain to use and the labeling of the menus is very confusing. Definitely not a deal breaker.",Other Thoughts:No contest! BUY IT!,0,0

It's not like I'm going to take the time to make sure it has a 2ms response time, but I believe it's probably the best 27"" monitor I've purchased up until now.","Cons:So far, there haven't been any cons.  It was exactly the product I expected it to be.","Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor along with a 27"" Acer and 2 27"" Samsungs.  The Newegg prices were so good for Black Friday this year, I went kinda nuts.  Anyway, the Asus definitely holds it's own with the Samsungs.  I wouldn't hesitate to  use this monitor to do color correction on for a movie or even do print work on.  I don't game, but I'm sure this monitor would be a great addition to any gamer's rig.",1,0

If you want higher resolution for gaming, this is not your monitor. If you want ultra-fast response time to handle fast, complex 3D animations, this is not a great monitor. If you want specialized color settings, this is not a great monitor. Don't but this if you actually need to use the speakers. But if you want a 27"" monitor that you can rely on to create 1920 x 1080 content on every day, all day long -- you should buy this instead of something more expensive.",1,1

ASUS,VE248H,1,Horrible Display,2012-12-07,Pros:This monitor is cheap.,"Cons:While the price makes this monitor attractive, its color is awful. For example, I run a WordPress blog, and the borders and shading in the Dashboard are invisible. No amount of fiddling with the color settings will make them show up. I have a cheaper, 5-year-old Sceptre monitor that does a better job.","Other Thoughts:If you just want a cheap monitor, you won't be disappointed. This is cheap.

It truly looks amazing!","Cons:I own this Monitor since August 2012 and I really like it. I bought it just for gaming. However there is just ONE major issue. Screen Tearing! I can't play none of my games with out having to enable V-sync on, thus locking my Frame Rate to only 60 FPS. I using it with an HDMI cable. I tried everything to eliminate the screen tearing even enabled iGPU and installed Virtu-MVP so I could use the Virtual Sync option but that didn't work either. I'm forced to play games that my system could well be running at 100 FPS down to only 60FPS. Simply because the monitor can't keep up with the Refresh rate.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Everything I Hoped For,2012-12-02,"Pros:Lightweight, easy to set up, and they look nice.  I feel like I'm engulfed in monitor.  I bought two of them and my only concern is needing a bigger desk to fit all the awesome in front of me.  The buttons to switch ""modes"" are nice for gaming or general use.  I find that games, when the monitor is in the ""RGB"" mode, are too dark.  The ""gaming"" mode works nice, however.","Cons:The DVI cables that come with the monitors are only 3' long.  If your computer is not within 3' comfortably, you'll have to use different DVI cables.  Thankfully I had two 6' cables, from my previous two monitors, so I used those instead.I wish they came with an HDMI cable but that's not a con, obviously.","Other Thoughts:This monitor is awesome and for what I got it on sale at, it was well worth purchasing two.

The 2ms response time makes it great for gaming. Having 4 different inputs also makes this monitor very versatile. It would work great in an eyefinity setup.,Cons:The only con that I can think of is the display resolution. It is basically the absolute minimum resolution for a 27 inch screen. This monitor would look even better if it had an IPS display and 2560x1440p resolution.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor to replace my 23 inch, 1080p Acer monitor and now I have a triple monitor setup which this monitor works great for as my primary display.",1,0

Not one dead pixel in all this time, the response is always crisp and bright, with good contrast and deep blacks, and I don't detect any ghosting during gaming. All and all, the best monitor I've ever had. I use external speakers, so I don't use the ones built in with the monitor, as such I can't rate them, but visually it's unparalleled.","Cons:Could be a little higher on the stand... but that's about it, otherwise nothing.","Other Thoughts:This monitor seems to go on sale often, when it does grab it!",0,0

No ghosting, No dead pixels and a very quick response time for high competitive game play. If you have a 23"" or smaller monitor now and are very used to it do not be afraid to upgrade to this 27"" it will not mess up the way you play.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Not for Digital Artists,2012-11-28,"Pros:Simple Design, High quality display, Perfect contrast and color right out of the box.",Cons:Not enough pixels for a 27 inch,Other Thoughts:It's a great monitor if you're upgrading from a regular non-led lcd. It's awesome for games and pretty much everything but if you're a digital artist it's not so good because there is simply not enough pixels for the size of the monitor. You can slightly see the jagged edges of any curve like the start button on Win 7. There is an option to reduce the sharpness but then it looks too soft. It's a sweet monitor and I will still use it for art and photo editing but will save for the PB Asus for the future.,0,1

I'm not experiencing any dead pixels or any other problems that I have been reading in the reviews.","Cons:It's a little wobbly, maybe the stand could support it better.  I'm a little afraid my cats could knock it over, but maybe that can't be helped due to the size of this thing.",,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Good gaming monitor,2012-11-27,"Pros:This monitor is a real nice match for an Xbox.  The contrast is excellent and there were no dead pixels out of the box (if you think you have a dead pixel, try dusting the screen off).  Colors really pop on this monitor, but the black levels are only about average, not quite as good as some other monitors.  It's almost too bright even on the lowest settings, but still not as bad as my HP ZR30w.  It's lightweight and the base has a hold-down screw so it doesn't fall off when you pick up the monitor.  The included cables are rather short: power 5', DVI 5', RGB 5', speaker 6'.  HDMI and Displayport cables are not included.  The blue power light is not too obtrusive, it's bested only by the HP style auto-blanking power LED.","Cons:Although it says ""HDMI"" right on the bezel, a HDMI cable is not included.ASUS should have left out the speakers entirely; they are not in the same class as the display quality.  They are completely enclosed and sound can only get out through the vents on the top back edge of the monitor.  So plan on using a decent set of external speakers with this monitor.",Other Thoughts:It comes well packaged and even has a carrying handle on the box.  And of course Newegg's lightning fast shipping is a real bonus.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,"Great screen, poor interface",2012-11-27,"Pros:Great screen. I moved up from a 22-inch display to make type more legible on screen, and the larger screen is great for that. It also gives me more screen real estate, so I can work on two documents at once. Plugged into my MacMini and ran easily once I figured out the instructions. Now that it's up and running, I'm still fiddling with adjustments, but generally happy.","Cons:Worst instructions I have seen in years. The only directions in the box were on a single folded piece of paper slightly larger than the screen which contained tiny type in 31 (I counted) languages. When I finally found the English version, the details were sketchy and incomplete, missing vital details on what the controls did. The pushbutton controls are cumbersome, hard to identify (visually) on the frame, and non-intuitive to use. You need a manual to understand them, but the only manual is online, not packaged with the monitor.","Other Thoughts:I am a freelance writer, and bought this monitor to make my work -- largely with documents and the Web -- easier on my eyes. It does that well, but the set-up instructions were painful to read and the adjustment controls are hard to use.",0,1

ASUS,VE248H,5,Looks and works great with XBOX 360 S,2012-11-25,"Pros:I was going to buy a higher-end Asus monitor but I realized that the Xbox would have had trouble with the 1920X1200 resolution, so I went with this one instead.  Based on reviews and on its relative tech specs, it looked like the best choice and I am very happy with it!It looks great with the Xbox and it's nice that I can plug some speakers into the monitor as well.I like the slim bezel and the sleek look of this monitor, and it's good to see that it comes pre-packaged with VGA, DVI, and audio cables.  I did have to supply my own HDMI cable but that wasn't a problem.","Cons:Only issue was that the buttons are a bit of a pain.  Located on the underside of the monitor, they're a little difficult to locate and the purpose of each was not immediately obvious.  Not that big of a deal though.",,0,0

Just about every monitor comes out of the box with color calibration intended to wow customers looking at it in a store.  Color calibration on this monitor is a little time consuming because of the menu controls.,"Other Thoughts:My recommendation for color calibration - let display warm up for 30 minutes.  Set color temperature to User mode and R/G/B of 90, contrast and brightness 70.  Then in your graphics driver set pixel format to RGB 4:4:4 then adjust your gamma.Also note that the DisplayPort connection on this monitor is full size DP and your graphics card DP output is probably min DP. So keep that in mind when buying your cabling.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Works perfectly,2012-11-18,"Pros:It looks nice, HDMI, DVI, great for gaming",Cons:Nothing really,"Other Thoughts:Overall incredible and the best monitor I've had (not hard to beat but still, better than most monitors I've used). The speakers work well and get pretty loud, but they aren't the best speakers, but still really good since I only bought this for about $150 on sale.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Bleed baby bleed,2012-11-18,Pros:Lovely size monitor at what seems to be a good price.  Good for gaming.,"Cons:Bleeds light like it's going out of style.  I have two of these and they both bleed.  Not noticeable when viewing most content but anytime you have a dark background you will notice a ring or halo around the edges of the screen.I have been less than pleased with ASUS on this monitor.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt as I have a bunch of ASUS gear and sent one in to get fixed.  To my dismay it came back broken and physically damaged.  After plugin in a DVI cord, nothing happens.Since it's past the return time on Newegg I can't return it, and ASUS, at least right now, say they won't refund me because they say they don't sell to the public.  So it seems I'm stuck playing this game of send it in and see if they can fix it (even though the monitor was damaged the last time it was sent in.)So looks like I'm stuck with a $300 paperweight.  Thanks ASUS!",Other Thoughts:A 2 year warranty isn't worth squat if they won't take care of you.  If you're time is worth anything immediately return your monitor rather than send it in for service.,3,3

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Value,2012-11-15,Pros:VESA Mount for wall mounting or multi-monitor setup. Fairly thin bezel which is also nice for multi-monitor configurations.,"Cons:Video connections point downward instead of ""out"" from the back. Not a big con, but it makes hiding cables a little more challenging - certainly not worth an egg.","Other Thoughts:I have 3 monitors. This 27"" Asus in the middle and two Asus 24"" on each side. All three are connected to a Sapphire Ultimate HD7750 card (no fans, low power, silent card). I had to use an ""Active"" adapter with this monitor. If you need three monitors, I bought a very high quality triple monitor stand on e bay for $119. Sellers name is ""easymountlcd"". It's a great stand - simply cant beat the value. HOWEVER, be aware that these monitors are good, not perfect. Meaning that when mounted on a stand, and viewed from the side, you might notice a slight color difference - not because of low quality, but because of the viewing angle. I found that turning my side monitors inward a little, I was able to minimize the discoloring affect by looking at each monitor more ""directly"".",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome Display,2012-11-14,"Pros:I had originally bought this to upgrade from my main 22"" monitor and get rid of my old 17"" secondary.

Respectfully, this monitor goes will with gaming, and everyday work - photoshop, 3d modeling, effects, or simply typing up a report.  No dead pixels, no strange lines, no random shut off's, and I have owned this monitor for almost a year.","Cons:I was wary with purchasing this monitor as SO MANY have listed dead pixel(s), as well as many other flaws plaguing this product.  After grooming the reviews, both on newegg and other sites, I finally purchased one.  I have not had any problems, no dead pixels, no strange lines, no random shutting off and on.My only other complaint would be the 1080p resolution, it is ok… but, this standard is less than desirable.  Though that is my opinion, and could vary greatly from person to person.","Other Thoughts:I feel satisfied with the price I paid for this product, as at the time it was $280.00, with free shipping.

I know people in the reviews kept saying that and i told myself ""but those people don't know how to calibrate a monitor properly""Sure enough i'm not quite happy with the colors. Its oddly slightly off....99% of people wouldn't notice a thing and LOVE the quality. I'm in the 1%.",Other Thoughts:Would i buy again.... surprisingly yes!

ASUS,VE248H,4,"Great monitor, needs configuring though",2012-11-11,"Pros:Beautiful monitor, big but just the right size, amazing quality.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Good,2012-11-11,"Pros:I would give this 4 and a half out of 5 if I could. Spectacular colour (yes it is spelled colour in Canada) contrast. Colours are deep and vibrant.Just to give you an idea, this monitor completely beats a 2010 Macbook Pro Unibody 13"" screen for colour contrast, vibrance, and overall realism. The brightness of these LED 300cd/m2 monitors are absolutely insane. There is no amount of sunlight that can ruin the picture quality. The ""splendid"" presets are amazing.Typically I like Night View, Scenery Mode, or Theatre Mode. All three give great settings for different, well, settings. Depending on what you are doing you'll want to switch your profile, but Asus makes it easy with a single button dedicated to colour profile switching.1080p Blu Ray looks phenominal on this monitor. Better than any TV I have seen this size. For the price and quality you can't beat Asus.I would recommend this monitor to anyone who wants limited blur (2ms response time)","Cons:The Speakers. I'm ok with the speakers sucking, but even the headphone jack on them is useless. You'll want to get an extension cord for your headphones/speakers and stay away from using any audio. Don't worry though the Audio should not change your mind. If all your speakers are broken the Asus speakers make a good 3rd option/backup option so that's all they should be there for.","Other Thoughts:Get this monitor if you know what is good for you. Don't go with another brand. Samsung, Dell, anyone else even TV makers have a hard time coming close to Asus picture quality.I would say the closest thing to this monitor's quality for any LCD LED would be something Sony made. Sony's high end TVs. That it. So for the money you are getting the best monitor of your life for half the price of the equivalent high end TV.No Brainer buy.",2,0

I set everything back to default, swapped cables, tried on another computer... same issue. Come to find out this is a fairly common defect. Sigh. Packed it all up and sent it back to Newegg and had to pay $30 bucks in shipping which wasn't reimbursed, nor was the $10 for shipping when I bought it... kind of lame but whatever.

Not really sure if I can just buy any other longer generic cable?Also, when I started the screen for the first time with the HDMI connection, the default vga input was selected. because of that it would think there was no connection and thus shut off. I had to try a few time until I pressed the power and also immediately pressed the input. That worked.Since then it's been flawless.Also... The speakers sound like you're in a large room or something. It sounds like the sound is projected from to rear, to the rear.

ASUS,VE248H,3,UH OH,2012-10-15,"Pros:Great Display, No Ghosting for me with Default Settings.",Cons:Whether it was on the monitor when I got it or appeared 2 days later. There was a small red dot on the screen when in black environments it was just annoying so I RMA'd it for a new one.,"Other Thoughts:I won't give up on ASUS yet, never really dealt with there support but A+ for the Newegg support. I just hope the next monitor that comes doesn't have this issue. Thought about getting a different but I really loved this one.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Awesome for the price,2012-10-12,"Pros:Amazing quality.   I feel spoiled when I come home from work and sit in front of this monitor, given the size and overall quality of it.","Cons:If you use the built in speakers, expect a loud pop/click when the PC allows the monitor to sleep; a minor issue since I use headphones 80% of the time, but it's still something to be aware of.","Other Thoughts:I can't really find a good setting for color/contrast setting to run with all the time, I have to keep switching between presets, not a problem really since I'm particular with what things look like when gaming/browsing/watching videos.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good price for the size,2012-10-12,"Pros:LED is better as we all know.  The color and contrast could be better, I've owned Apple monitors and found out they're better in everyway to color to contrast.You have a bunch of features but you have to calibrate it to your liking and I don't really care for that.  Other than that the size is good for the price and so far it works.",Cons:You have to calibrate it and keep changing it to game mode if you want to see brighter picture.,"Other Thoughts:If there's a monitor out there with better color and contrast please show me, other than that the size of this monitor is the right size for gamers/graphic designer like myself.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Really?,2012-10-11,"Pros:Monitor looks good, vivid colors. Not so much the dead pixels...","Cons:Where to begin? Ordered this monitor Open Box and it had a dead pixel on it. Okay, thats fine. It was open box. Would think newegg checks all open box items for these sort of defects but what can you do? Paid $40 to ship it back.Return it and bought the same exact monitor brand new. Brand new, opened the box, and what do you know? Another dead pixel.. Will never buy a monitor from a 'website' especially one that makes you pay for return shipping for a defective product. I'll never order another monitor from ASUS again. I much rather have a Catleap at this point because if there was a dead pixel, it'd be much smaller due to the WQHD resolution. I'm already $500+ in the hole.","Other Thoughts:Apparently if you do NOT have more than 1 dead pixel, it's not covered for warranty. Honestly, who set this standard? Any dead pixel (be it 1 or 1 million) would indicate that this product wasn't inspected properly and the lcd is bad quality. This really makes me wonder how long my DirectCU II card is going to last...",2,5

ASUS,VE248H,1,Really ASUS ? REALLY???????,2012-10-09,"Pros:Bright, 1080P","Cons:Horrible dithering problem as mentioned by other techy users.  NewEgg refused to replace these as the original packaging was accidentally disposed of.  ASUS refuse to admit that this horrible dithering is a defect and essentially claim ""You get what you pay for"":""If you want to RMA this to us, we will replace it, but with the same model, which means dithering will most likely to show up again and that defeats the purpose of getting it exchanged.Besides the dithering, do you have any other issues with this monitor?CelesteASUS Customer Loyalty""""Please contact your vendor and try to arrange an exchange for adifferent model. VE228H is an affordable TN monitor, so TN ditheringseems to be more noticeable especially if you are using them for gamingor anything that's moving really fast with high-quality graphics cardsand high resolution. ""------I am not using these displays for video, just simple user support, RDP, VNC, Outlook etc.","Other Thoughts:NewEgg bent me over and ASUS had their way with me.  That's the last time.   18 years of ASUS customer loyalty down the tubes.  I will no longer purchase anything ASUS that is not a motherboard.  I could have spent $30 for a Samsung monitor that puts this one to shame and has no noticable ""TN Dithering"".

ASUS,VE248H,4,Gamers Only,2012-10-05,"Pros:* This is my 3rd one in surround gaming. Good for that.* Thin-ish bezels* No dead pixels* If you are buying these for any reason other than gaming, keep looking. Great 2ms gaming monitors.* No ghosting*Decent price",Cons:* Colors/brightness are waaaay 'off'I have 3 of these and none of them really match each other's colors/brightness. Much tweeking required in the menu. The best I could do was get them 'good enough'* Speakers are useless. Don't let the speakers be a factor in your decision.* Wobbly stand (but not too cheap). It's acceptable but all Dell monitors I've used are significantly more stable. It wont fall over during normal use or a table bump but even a small bump on the table/desk will shake the monitor.* HDMI is of questionable functionality. My machine will detect the monitor if plugged into HDMI but will not allow me to 'activate' the display or send any picture there. DVI works without issue. This is true on all 3 monitors.,"Other Thoughts:We have 20+ of these monitors at work (video game dev) so I knew what I was buying. These are not made for accurate color representation and are in no way professional monitors. These are large, cheap, fast, gaming monitors. Reading text on these is fine for casual web browsing but extended text work/document creation or anything other than gaming is best done on a different monitor.-1 Egg for spotty HDMI",2,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Under $300? You kiddin' me???,2012-10-05,"Pros:This monitor is amazing. Nice vibrant colors that pop, and nice deep blacks. No dead pixels. Very nice selection of inputs, and lots of options to play around with in the menu. If you aren't happy with the way it looks out of the box, you have a nice array of options to choose from and tweak. I wasn't getting much heat off of the monitor either. Guild Wars 2 and Skyrim look amazing on this thing.",Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:When I upgraded to this monitor from my 22 inch Samsung Syncmaster, I knew it would be a nice upgrade.

RMA'ing it.,"Other Thoughts:I realize there is always gonna be some dead electronics, but having to RMA a monitor is very annoying. The whole process of RMAing is very annoying. In general, I'm annoyed. I've always had bad luck with RMAing ASUS products anyway. In past, I had to RMA the same motherboard 4 times until they sent me a working one. It was outrageous. I'm just glad Newegg has to deal with their support this time and not me.",2,2
ASUS,VE248H,1,Not Very Good...,2012-09-28,Pros:This really is a pure gaming monitor.,"Cons:Colors are way out of whack. Even with a few hours of calibrating it's just not worth the money.Dead pixels. Just a manufacturing flaw, but enough for a return.",Other Thoughts:If your a gamer and will use this ONLY for gaming I am sure it will do the trick. Colors are bright and response time is fast.If you use a IPS as your main monitor don't even think of buying this monitor. Just reading web pages will burn holes in your eyes.Luckily the monitor had a few dead pixels so I was able to return with no problem.Thank You Newegg,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,Do not buy for gaming,2012-09-26,Pros:The Splendid button is amazing. Just switch to theater mode or scenery mode and the colors will look perfect.,"Cons:Moving objects on screen have a strange ""mesh-like"" film that appears over them until they stop moving. It is at first hard to notice but once you do you it will seem like you are looking through a faint screen door covering any moving object. Although probably not relevant, you can recreate this ""mesh"" by moving your head back and forth on a static object on screen and it will still appear.","Other Thoughts:My friend has a similar model from ASUS but it is the next larger size. He does not have this problem. I titled this ""Do not buy for gaming"" simply because I bought it for games and I returned it because I couldn't stand seeing the mesh appear. The problem also was seen watching Netflix. Basically, if you are only going to be using the internet the mesh won't be an issue, but then again why would you need an HD monitor if you aren't going to be using applications with nice graphics.",2,2

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2012-09-26,"Pros:Lots of inputs, including displayport. The monitor tilt angle is ridiculous. I don't know why others say you can't do it.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Where's the awesomeness?,2012-09-26,"Pros:When turned off, it's a beautiful component. It's much, much, much lighter than the Dell 2001FPit replaced, and the connections are fairly easy to get to.","Cons:When you turn it on, that's where the goodness stops. It is blindingly bright out of the box, and once you change the Splendid display you loose access to the brightness control forever. I attempted to correct for the brightness and color through my Catalyst control panel, but it only makes the situation worse. The brightness and color temp now appear to be dynamic - it changes based on what's displayed on the screen. For example, my son's wallpaper is Bumblebee, and when I showed him as I was setting it up, he asked why he was red and not yellow - I had a control panel window open at that time, and we I closed it, Bumblebee turned yellow again.I can't get this thing under control, and my wife and kids hate it. To be honest, so do I. Being blinded at o-dark-thirty in the morning when I'm fresh out of bed isn't my idea of a good morning.","Other Thoughts:Asus' support site is nonexistent. When it doesn't crash Safari or Chrome, it returns a blank page. If I can't find any other sources of support to get this thing set up correctly, it's going back in the box and back to Newegg. I'll glady pay the 15% to get it out of my house.If I can capture it, I'll upload a video of the color and brightness changes on the fly.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good Monitor disappointed with speakers,2012-09-25,"Pros:Great monitor, fast response time. Will buy again.",Cons:Poor speaker volume levels.  I am disappointed with the total output level of these speakers. I understand that these are only 1W speakers but the volume levels are very low.  I can barely hear sound coming from the speakers with the computer volumes set to 100%.  I was required to buy an inline amplifier to boost the sound to an acceptable level for our environment.,Other Thoughts:I will have 4 other monitors to buy that need to have speakers included in the design.

Speakers sound like laptop speakers and are not very loud even with everything at full blast. This is a monitor, not a speaker set. It would be nice if it didn't have speakers so it could save me a little more money?The Asus 24 inch IPS 1200 resolution monitor went on sale the next day :(I would have gotten that one even though it was around $300 on sale",Other Thoughts:Overall great product.

I also got a $18 dollar rebate AMEX card within a month ($20 rebate, 10% for fast processing).In general, I like Asus products, but this monitor has proven to be the best non-IPS nmnitor I have ever owned. It looks great, is durable, and the picture quality is better than anything remotely close to the price. There is another Asus that is almost perfect (""H"" model), but it is twice the price. I have gamed on that one behind a 670, and it is insane.",Cons:The connections on the back are difficult to find and use. I need to pick the thing up and turn it upside down to plug eveything in.,"Other Thoughts:I cannot say enought good things about this monitor. I have bought many monitor for my rapidly growing start-up, so I have tried all of the models. Mostly I buy 23-inch or 24-inch models.

ASUS,VE248H,1,,2012-09-15,"Pros:Might be good, if it didn't display a faint diamond crosshatch pattern anytime something moves on screen or I turn my head from side to side.","Cons:There is either something wrong with my monitor or there is something wrong inherantly with my brain with viewing these cheap LED-LCD monitors. Anytime I physically move my head from side to side, or drag elements around on the screen (like the scrollbar of a webpage) a faint diamond crosshatch pattern becomes visible. It goes away when things stop moving. It is so distracting that I am going to return the monitor. I believe it is some kind of flicker rate issue or something.. either way my monitor is not satisfactory. My old Dell 1280x1024 does not show these motion artifacts and it also renders text much better. Text is clearly defined to a single pixel width on the Dell 1280x1024 monitor whereas text on the 1080p Asus monitor appears to stretch over 2 pixels, causing the text on the 1080p monitor to actually be *less sharp* than the 1280x1024 monitor.

There were no dead pixels, and it shows a beautiful image. Being the nice guy, I gave the working one to my wife, and will opt to replace the dead one for me.These are beautiful monitors and for the limited tests I did, on her computer before I logged off to write this review, (Guild Wars 2 on max settings and resolution) it was gorgeous.The menu options were easy to use as well.Even though one of the two monitors was defective, I gave this 5 stars b/c Newegg will make sure we have two perfect monitors once all is said and done, and with no extra costs to us.And when in perfect working order these monitors do deserve five stars.I have not tried out the speakers b/c we use headphones, so I cannot comment on their quality.","Cons:First monitor:-No response-Defective productWe ordered two of these, one for my wife, and one for me.

The nice lady said to check my email for the free shipping tag, and to mail the defective monitor out when I can.Newegg customer service is easy to work with, and a wonderful experience. If you take nothing else to take away from this post, its this:When these monitors are on sale, they are worth the 169.99 + free shipping (3 day), and a defect is not a problem, since Newegg is willing to replace the defective ones, hassle free.",0,0

However with less then 5hrs of actual use I had at least one dead pixel near a main focal point on my screen. But I let it go because I understand that things happen so I sent it in for a quick replacement. After a waiting period I got my replacement and within 20 minutes I had at least one dead pixel in the same location on my screen. If I had owned the monitor and used it 10hrs a day for a year, that would be somewhat reasonable for a dead pixel. But within 20minutes and I had a problem with a previous one, ummmm never again.

ASUS,VE248H,5,I like it.,2012-09-11,"Pros:This thing has a great picture. I bought it for my newly built gaming rig. I have little to no trouble with ghosting and have yet to come across something that even irks me for a second or two. I really like how it offers a switch between the inputs with one button. The only trouble I ever ran into with it was when i went to plug a second rig into it. The screen auto switches to the active input so I ran into some trouble with getting to the input I wanted, however that is not a con because that is above and beyond what it was intended to do. Very worth the full price.",Cons:So far nothing and I have owned for about 4-5 months.,"Other Thoughts:The speakers are not top quality by any standard, however the fact that they are included is nice.

It had several issues right out of the box which is why I graded 3 eggs, if possible I would have graded 2 1/2.1) DVI does not work, neither from the onboard (MoBo) or the GPU even when setting to DVI manually2) I was forced to use VGA for a while until my HDMI cable got here. With VGA the image was no centered and there was no setting to fix it, not even on bios.3) HORRIBLE GHOSTING WITH VGA CABLE! Couldn't even play a game for more than 10 min because of the GHOSTING. I bought this monitor for GAMING.4) Tearing: The image while in game keeps tearing on some games, I even disabled V-Sync and lowered some of the settings with no avail.5) The solution to the ghosting arrived when I started using my HDMI cable.

Shipping was fast and the monitor arrived in flawless condition. Not a single dead pixel or issue. The quality of the picture and how accurate the colors are on the preset modes (Gaming, Theater, Scenic, etc...) all with the push of a button on the bottom of the screen is unbelievable.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Big and Bright,2012-08-30,Pros:BigBrightColorfulCustomer choice award winner!Price,Cons:Not free?,"Other Thoughts:This thing is bright, so bright it may blind you. It has different presets though, and you can also manually adjust the brightness and other settings. This is my first LED, so I was not used to the brightness. After using it a couple days I like it and keep it on the ""scenery"" preset. That seems to make things look the best, at least for me. I'm a photographer and this monitor makes my pictures look incredible. So much brighter and more colorful than my old LCD did.The colors of things seem different than they were on my old monitor, but maybe that is just because my old monitor didn't have as bright a screen or colors. For example the Facebook blue bar is a totally different shade of blue on this monitor than on my old LCD. Skin tones also look different. But I guess this is true of any monitor. No two will display a picture exactly the same way. Especially if one is an LCD and one is an LED.Overall this is a good monitor and I do recommend it.",1,0

Every time their is a screen change, like loading up a game, the input source label flashes on the screen (at least while using HDMI).  That's a little annoying but perhaps there is a way to turn that off.  I'll have to look in to that more.  This monitor has built in speakers.

I did however figure out whats causes it ill explain more below.","Other Thoughts:When you go into setting, then image there is an option called trace free, if the ghosting is causing a problem for you can fiddle with this option is has a slider that goes up and down. I turned it down to zero and i haven't seen anymore ghosting on the forums. So just mess with the slider tell you find your happy medium of quality with picture and tracing.

I don't think dead pixels areas common as other reviews suggest.No ghosting.I use this monitor for 2 desktops and 1 xbox. All 3 are able to share the same computer speakers, using hdmi and a 20$ KVM switch that supports audio. I use the audio cable included with monitor to connect KVM to the headphone port, and I plug my speakers into the speaker port. So all 3 devices swap to the speakers when I switch inputs.Switching inputs is very easy and fast. Remember how many times to click to get to your next device, and  it takes 1 second. It is a very convenient monitor with lots of ports, and VGA, dvi, and hdmi all look good on it. I don't have anything with display port but that is like hdmi basically.","Cons:1920x1080, for the size, if I had more money I might want higher resolution.. Not really the monitors fault, and doesn't impact greatly.Speakers could be better, like similarly sized tvs.","Other Thoughts:Great for several devices.

ASUS,VE248H,5,great moniter,2012-08-03,Pros:this thing is nothing like what people have been saying. speaker wise there a tad bit grainy but there good speakers for the size. the picture on it is flawless no dead pixels has different viewing options on it like theater gaming standard custom etc.,Cons:the box was in pretty bad shape when I got it but no scratches or anything on the monitor so no reason to dock an egg for that.,Other Thoughts:buy this monitor if your looming for something not to big or to small its tilt is amazing and is a well bang for the buck.,1,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,,2012-08-03,"Pros:Nice screen after you set it up.  It is crisp, bright, and if you've got someone's settings like I found on another site after googling around, it works great.

They're so distracting that my eyes tend to gravitate towards them, especially during movies. Now I have to send it back for a replacement just to gamble on another monitor that may have the same or even more dead pixels.I reached out to ASUS on my dissatisfaction of having to pay 30 bucks to send back a product i'm not entirely happy with.

ASUS,VE248H,3,"Amazing Monitor, Dead Pixels u_u",2012-07-16,Pros:The quality and settings of this monitor are very good and the colors are just right. It is an LED monitor so energy savings and brightness are a plus. The viewing angle is average and is best when looking at the monitor perpendicular to the surface.,"Cons:Alas, it arrived with (two) dead pixels and under ASUS's dead pixel policy, an LCD monitor must have more than 5 dead dark dot pixels (dark under ANY pattern) or more than 3 dead bright dot pixels (white under only BLACK patterns) to be sent in for an even exchange; so if you have 5 dead dark pixels, you are, sadly, S.O.L.","Other Thoughts:I can see the dead dark dot pixels as I type this review with newegg's white background... But remember, it's all in your head if a single pixel is bothering you... of course, it's disappointing and ASUS can suck it, but it's just not worth their time to replace a few pixels on hardware out of the million that they have working lol.Just beware, ASUS has been known to have some dead pixels and it is just sad...

I used it for one week when I noticed this glob of what looked like ink near the bottom of the screen, which everyone i spoke to at newegg and asus called dead pixel.

ASUS,VE248H,1,ASUS IS Horrible Company,2012-07-11,Pros:None!,"Cons:Bought it for my mother who died before she received it. I didn't bother to open the box for almost 4 months later. I used it for a week when this huge pixel the size of a silver dollar shoes up near the bottom of the screen. To late to send it back to Newegg so got an RMA to send it back to ASUS. A week later they email me to say it has liquid damage ""thats what they call pixel damage I guess"" and that they want $65 for labor and $105 for parts to fix it or they will send it back unfixed. Since I paid Newegg $169 plus shipping on sale, why would anyone pay $205 to fix this dog? I'm gonna take it out for 12 gauge target pratice whenever it comes back from ASUS. I'm sticking with ACER, never had a problem with them. I've spent lots of money with ASUS buying motherboards and whatnot. They'll never see money from me again. NEVER!",,3,32

I use it with a MacBook Pro, my Desktop, and my PS3, but since it only has 1 HDMI input, no DVI input, and one Display Port input, switching between devices can be a pain. Not only is physically switching the cables devices annoying, but so is switching between inputs on the monitor itself. If the monitor starts up and doesn't have a signal for the input it's set to, it almost immediately switches to a power-save mode that won't let you switch between inputs. The way around this is to restart the monitor and try to switch inputs before it changes to the power-save mode. Also, although I highly recommend calibrating it on your own and not using the presets, the ""game mode"" preset does some funny things when using my Playstation. It will fade to black on the PS-menu screen and during loading screens. I'm really baffled to why it does this.",1,1

So, I won't waste time with those.However, the screen blacking out whenever there's a 90%-100% black scene on the monitor doesn't seem to get mentioned much.  I first noticed the issue when I'd boot my PC and BIOS screens wouldn't appear.  After almost a year and many adjustments it still happens in games while running around in the dark.  What happens is the monitor goes black, as if it's in sleep mode, but the game is still going (as my face gets eaten off).  You can even sit in the dark part of a game and flip though the monitor's presets to watch it happen.The best solution I've come up with is to use Nightview mode and turn off ASCR (that gimmick that's supposed to make contrast amazing).  Even after adjustments it still happens, just not as often.",0,0

As polite as I could, I told them first and foremost that this damage occurred out of my hands, and that I really couldn't afford what they wanted me to pay; nope, if you're not going to pony up the cash then we're sending this back to you. I told the courier to send it back. What use would I have for a monitor with a damaged screen? I almost felt like them trying to send it back to me was just rubbing salt on the wound.

I have been a customer of Newegg for close to 20 years and this is the first time that they have messed up.

ASUS,VE248H,4,"Good, Basic Monitor",2012-06-14,,,"Comments:This monitor is almost too large for my needs. Bigger isn't always better. I had to move the monitor further from my key board so I can see the screen w/o turning my head. A 21.5"" would be a more appropriate size for me.Some comments indicated the screen was ""wide"" but not ""tall"". This is a standards wide screen format. What is a bit surprising the first time you see a web page on a wide screen is how spread out the page appears.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Now, I can truly appreciate Lasik",2012-06-12,"Pros:This is an AMAZING monitor. It has managed to DESTROY every monitor that I have ever owned.  I am so glad I have waited for this one!  The whites and the Blacks are awesome, Contrast is amazing and can be very bright.  Especially for an LCD! The sharpness of the fonts... outstanding! Color range is AMAZING and beautiful. Controls are just fine with me, I like push buttons. AMAZING deal for the price!","Cons:Base is eh, but most are nowadays. however it suit my need fine.  Needs some calibration out of the box, but most monitors or tv's do.  No star loss Found it Cheaper at other places NEWEGG","Other Thoughts:This monitor has blown my socks clean off, For the first time ever, I am proud to own an LCD. I love my Panasonic Plasma TV and this monitor is equal in quality as far as I can tell.  I had zero dead pixels, Thank goodness, and Asus as far as I can see is blowing away the competition, if you are picky and choose your product carefully.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,ASUS VE278Q,2012-06-12,Pros:Nice sized screen. Really sharp video. Great colors. Reasonable price.,"Cons:I've had two of these. I sent the first one back.1) It's really picky about it's power cord. The power cord on the first monitor wouldn't work. I found a spare cord that did work, but that monitor eventually got to where the power light wouldn't even come on.The replacement monitor works with the power cord that came in the box, but the cord was about a foot too short for my office. So I went through all my spares until I found a longer cord that the new monitor liked.2) This next point is a little weird. When the first monitor failed, I could get it to come on if I picked it up, and rotated it 90 degrees to the left (basically going from landscape to portrait mode). Then as soon as I rotated it back to a normal position it would go black again. I tried this for a while until it would no longer come on in either position.The new monitor does a similar thing. It only likes to be in a landscape position. Some times it turns off when rotated 90 degrees to the left.",Other Thoughts:Item 2) above scares me. I wonder how long it will be before I'm stuck with a dead monitor.3) When you first turn on the monitor it comes on in VGA mode. It then turns off about ten seconds later. You have to know to press the second button from the right to select HDMI (or whatever you're using). It seems they could have told us this in the setup instructions.,5,2
ASUS,VE248H,3,I hate TN panels! But this one works...,2012-06-12,"Pros:Great refresh rate, excellent monitor for a gamer, colors are excellent in games for the most part.LED backlit, low power, decent brightness from the right angle...Whites are great from head on (Slightly elevated above the monitor)","Cons:UGH...Color reproduction is not very good from any angle. If you are looking head on, certain hues of blue are practically invisible, if you move down far enough to see those shades of blue, the screen becomes dark and slightly yellow.Adjustments are not that great, menus are not very intuitive to navigate.","Other Thoughts:All in all, for the low price, it is worth it. Not for people that are finicky about color reproduction, an IPS panel would prove much better. It is definitely a solid monitor for the price, but it does have it's quirks.I often use it to watch movies from my bed (It is wall mounted on a pivoting mount) which is about six feet away, and my head is about a foot and a half to two feet (1/2-3/4 of a meter) from the center of the monitor and it can be quite dark, sometimes impossible to see what is going on in dark scenes, bright movies/scenes are great though, then again I need glasses and do not have them. :-)",2,0

ASUS responded saying they would address the issues I voiced in my last review and so I gave them a chance to. For almost two weeks now I been struggling to get a rapid replacement sent to me! They kept sending me regular RMA forms, then they would send me the Rapid Replacement forms but fail to add the attach documents which I had to fill out. Then they would send me those and I would fill them out and email them back, but then it would turn out to be a wrong email. IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS HARD! Not to mention I'm not happy they're putting a hold on my credit card until they receive my monitor.When I had issues with my Dell monitor all I had to do was call and they sent me a new refurbished one right away if I didn't return mine THEN they would charge your card. I didn't have to go through all these darn loops like I've been with ASUS. The Rapid Replacement is a joke and there's nothing RAPID about it. Never buying another ASUS product again",10,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,So Far So Good,2012-06-05,"Pros:Size is phenomenal for a desktop PC/PS3 gaming rig.  I tested it today with Skyrim, Ghost Recon, and a few game trailers and they all looked amazing.  When starting off with HD video viewing from the PS3, it was a bit rocky at first.  The picture quality wasn't what I expected or have seen, but with adjustments and tweaking of settings, the picture looks great.No dead pixels or problems so far, though this is day one.","Cons:The tweaking needed to be done is very specific in order to get decent quality picture from HD content, or video noise and artifacts will be present.  Not a big deal, but it will worry some people that have no clue what they need to do to get quality, or how to tweak setting to get the picture right.",,5,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2012-06-05,"Pros:Colors are vibrant, contrast is crisp, and a fast refresh to boot.

I do wish the stands had a bit more play, perhaps height adjustment, but alternative VESA stands aren't too pricey.","Other Thoughts:Haven't tried the speakers, but I bought these for the visual, not the audible.I had an issue with text readability in games (Diablo 3), but then I tried switching the monitor to gaming mode, and at actually works great.",2,0

Newegg, please provide more helpful descriptions!","Other Thoughts:Why are the manufacturers hooked on extremely wide, short screens?  Web pages are vertical.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Terrible pixelated graphics,2012-05-31,"Pros:I bought this monitor after returning a 27"" samsung that had the same features and pixel pitch. I returned the samsung because it was not wall mountable. This monitor, the VE278Q is wall mountable and has good tilt functions, as well as multiple inputs, but that is all that is good about it.","Cons:Terrible pixelated graphics even while watching Full HD 1080p movies. This problem is also seen during game play and is a deal breaker for me. None of the functions of the monitor resolve the issue and I have even tried using older versions of the AMD catalyst driver. The problem is so bad it's hard to believe it has the same pixel pitch as the other 27"" I had. When it is loading movie scenes or cut scenes in a game, it seems like it has an issue with loading the images to the screen and it takes to long for the signal to refresh. I am not sure if it is a manufacturing defect or if it's just a poor quality monitor. I will be returning to the store I bought it from. Asus make great motherboards, but I will not be buying a monitor from them again.",,0,7

The pictures great the monitor is nice and slime, it doesn't take up to much space on my desktop. When I wanted to get rid of my fat CRT tv also I bought a 2nd VE247H and a tunner card. With two VE247Hs I can work on my primary monitor and game or watch tv on the secondary monitor. My only complaint is that the speakers are to silent when on my PC input and a bit to noisy when Im running either my 360 or PS3.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Good Monitor Purchased on Sale,2012-05-22,"Pros:I purchased this monitor when it was $35 off plus $15 mail-in rebate.  Total was $155 for me.  This is my second ASUS monitor now and I am very satisfied with the quality.  I checked for dead pixels and there were none.- Speakers.  Most monitors don't come with speakers.  Although the sound isn't that great, it is nice having this option.  Especially if you use this as an adjunct monitor to a laptop like I do.  Better than laptop speakers, worse than real speakers.- Slim profile.  Not much to say except that it doesn't take a lot of deskspace.  I pretty much expect this from any LED/LCD monitors now though.","Cons:-Buttons.  The buttons on the monitor cumbersome to use and not intuitive.  It's a small negative that doesn't detract from the monitor really because once you adjust to your settings there's no reason to keep changing it.- No auto adjust.  This monitor doesn't have an auto adjust like many other monitors.  You have to calibrate the monitor yourself which can be annoying to do but again, it's just a one time thing you do in the beginning.","Other Thoughts:1080p, built in speakers, 2ms, high contrast, 24"" monitor for $155 shipped.  That is an excellent deal in my opinion.  It doesn't look like it is currently on sale but I'm sure it will be again soon.Also this is an eco-friendly monitor.  It has a reduced power mode you can use.  I prefer full power mode even though I haven't even tried the power saving option.",8,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Perfect upgrade monitor,2012-05-22,"Pros:This monitor has some great color and amazing contrast.  I have no dead pixels.   I am a web graphic designer and this monitor shows the colors better than my monitor at work.  Much brighter and MUCH richer colors than most monitors.It's very large.  I am happy I went with this one over the 25"".  My face is approximately 3' away from the screen and it feels comfortable being able to look from corner to corner without having to move my head.After you set it up once, no need to mess with it again.  I had no problems with the menu buttons.  It took me a quick second to learn what each one did, but I adjusted them to ""pure"" RGB color tabs.  Closest calibration besides buying a Huey and calibrating for RGB.Solid base.  I feel like this thing won't go anywhere.","Cons:As stated from a few others, I had a problem seeing red text.  It was pretty blurry and hard to read.  I believe this is a problem with AMD video cards and HDMI cables.  Not sure though.   All fixed in the AMD Catalyst Control Center (CCC).My Digital Flat-Panels > Pixel Format > RGB 4:4:4 Pixel Format PC Standard (Full RGB).Now the reds are perfect.  Just another piece of setup, no reason to take an egg off.",Other Thoughts:Feels great to unbox a big ticket item.  I am very happy with this monitor!,7,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Good monitor so far.,2012-05-19,,,"Comments:The ghosting other people have complained about can easily be fixed. I didn't notice it at all when using HDMI but with DVI it can be fixed by making sure you're not in scenery mode or whatever have you. I have mine in sRGB mode which isn't quite as vibrant but I prefer it that way. I've seen others say that turning off overdrive can also fix this (I think that's a setting in CCC because I haven't seen one in the monitor settings).All in all it looks great. I'm using this as my main monitor with my old 19"" HannsG next to it. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who isn't opposed with tinkering and calibrating.

ASUS,VE248H,3,3 times DOA,2012-05-18,Pros:1. This monitor looks absolutely fantastic when it works.2. Plenty of inputs including HDMI.3. The built in speakers are a bonus.,"Cons:1.

Multiple LEDs not functioning in different locations than the precious monitor.",Other Thoughts:The fourth monitor is functioning well so far.  Fingers crossed.,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Good for the price,2012-05-17,"Pros:This monitor is very good for its price.  I was very interested in a TN monitor that could deliver good color accuracy and grey scale range.  Most TN's drop to complete black at about grey value of 8-10 out of 255 or complete white at 250.   This one made it all the way 1, and to 253.  For this reason alone I have this monitor 5 stars, because it preforms just as I like.   Also there is very even backlight and no bleed around the edges.Also for the very particular this monitor has good processing time for its type, meaning it will not create excessive frame lag in your games.   That is miliseconds of lag between when the video card sends the data and when it appears on screen.Colors do need to be calibrated, but once done, this monitor's gamut is pretty darn good.   And there is NONE of that colors within colors ""TN-ness"" eye razors found in some cheaper displays.The DVI and HDMI ports let me hook up my xbox and PC to this.","Cons:The OSD menu is horrible. Its just one of the worst menus I've ever used.  Even owning this for a year and I still can't get to the function I want when I use it.And yes there is some ghosting and such in windows desktop, but it doesn't bother me terribly because I'm not very sensitive to it.","Other Thoughts:I am digital artist and and primarily bought this on price since I was a student at the time.  I found grey-scale accuracy to be the best thing I love about this display because I can easily see the difference between 1 and 8 grey out of 255 RGB.   When watching movies/playing games is the difference between the shadows being inky black, and seeing the details in them without having to jack the brightness and wash out the image.This gets 5 eggs because its a very good all around monitor, even if it's exceeded at specific tasks by others.   And for the price I paid it was the hands down winner.",5,0

Overall I'm happy with the monitor, used for basic work tasks where text clarity is most important.I read other reviews here after purchase and can confirm seeing what I would call ""ghosting"", a slightly darkened border about 1/4"" around windows. I can also confirm blur when I ""shake"" a window with white background - there's clearly some blurring artifact on the trailing side of text. This blur was very bad when connected via a DVI-to-VGA adapter, but it's much reduced, though not eliminated, using DVI directly.In my use, the ghosting and the blur will be a non-issue, but I note that a colleague's all-in-one computer doesn't have these issues. I may pursue adjustment remedies mentioned in other reviews.Overall I like the unit and think it's good value.",0,0

I RMA'd my original monitor only to receive a second monitor that was exactly the same.  The colors appear brownish when compared to my Asus laptop's screen.  Sitting next to each other, the difference is horribly visible.It's so frustrating in Battlefield 3 when you look up into the sky, for instance, and see a light blue ghosting trail behind the jets, for instance.  Also,  this monitor makes it IMPOSSIBLE to do any sort of graphic design as the colors are so muddy and brown.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Terrible high-frequency whine,2012-03-17,"Pros:- Price: After rebate, I was able to grab this monitor at a price that was exceptional for an LED-backlit monitor at the diagonal size of 27"".- Connectivity: Excellent here! The monitor provided many inputs as well as headphone and speaker jacks for those that want to route audio to the monitor and out through the headphone output to earphones or any set of computer speakers. I did however encounter a flimsy headphone output (see Cons and Other thoughts). I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the monitor had a DisplayPort input along with its HDMI, VGA, and DVI inputs.","Cons:- Workmanship: Meh. Wasn't beyond anything I've ever seen. The glossy sides and stand attracted fingerprints and dust EXTREMELY fast, as mentioned above, the headphone output on the back of monitor was flimsy, the outer shell was constantly creaking and cracking, and the stand looked like it was about to break any second if I bumped into my table on accident.- Image Quality: Even though the LED-backlighting was nice, I couldn't seem to find a good setting for color. The color and contrast seemed a bit...exaggerated. Maybe it's just me, but I wasn't a fan of it.- The LED Whine: Horrendous to say the least. Each LED-backlit monitor will have a soft fan going or maybe a quiet high-pitched whine, but this thing gave me raging headaches everyday. The capacitors must have been terrible, because the monitor was nearly screeching. This, once again, goes back to workmanship with the quality of capacitors they use. I was forced to return the monitor for this reason alone. Couldn't stand","Other Thoughts:Overall, it was two weeks of suffering. Decent picture quality, pretty good speakers, nice variety of connectivity options, and a cool blue power LED, however, the loud high-pitched whine was EXCRUCIATING. This is completely unacceptable, and was enough to drop my rating down to only 1 egg, as the monitor was unusable. If you get the monitor and find the whine not so bad at first, keep in mind that it'll only get worse as time goes by; the capacitors will obviously deteriorate.Workmanship wasn't bad, but still wasn't great, especially with the flimsy headphone output which failed to work if it was incorrectly bent or twisted the wrong way.Anyways, to conclude, I returned this monitor for a refund and purchased a Dell 24"" LED-backlit monitor instead, which I have had no problems with so far.",4,4

ASUS,VE248H,5,A great monitor and an unbeatable price,2012-03-06,,,"Comments:* I'm not the most tech savvy person out there, so it's possible I'm missing some fix for this (which is why it doesn't affect my overall score), but through HDMI with my PC outputting at 1920x1080, I have an annoying black border consuming roughly 3/4"" on the left and right, and just under 1/2"" on the top and bottom of the screen. There's no option in the monitor's menu to resolve this issue. Assuming this is an issue that can be addressed, it's not one that is obvious by any average customer like myself, and certainly an annoyance out-of-box to have to resolve for anyone.",0,0

I've read that it's possible.  This is my first experience with a stuck/dead pixel and I'm pretty sure it's a stuck one because it has a blue color on a white screen.  I heard dead pixels are all black.  Either way, I feel I shouldn't have to try and fix a product that I just took out of the box.  I am sending back and going with Samsung.

I own two of these monitors and both are doing the exact same thing, screen tearing. I purchased both at the same time and I'm shocked at how this could happen. I figured ASUS products are top of the line but truth of the matter they're not. Go read up on all the issues this monitor is having. I do believe after doing so you won't purchase this one.","Other Thoughts:I own ACER monitors and a few Samsung which are older then these two ASUS 27"" piles of garbage. Also keep in mind ASUS support is still worthless. I figured after all these years they'd finally fix that but I was wrong.I'm telling you stay away from this monitor.

Too bad, that extra real estate comes in handy for typical computer usage.  1920x1080 is fine for a TV, but less than ideal for a monitor.  I suppose there's a significant cost advantage in piggybacking production of panels for low-volume monitors off high TV production quantities.There's no excuse for the miserable ""documentation"" that comes in the box.  It includes 4283 languages, on one huge sheet, so the amount of information in YOUR language is, shall we say, ""limited"".  There is a real user manual available for download from ASUS, but you'll have to work a bit to find it.  Suggest starting with Google on ""VE248Q"" rather than clicking through their site.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Quality monitor at a great price,2012-02-01,,,"Comments:A few comments to other reviewers:#1: If you deduct an egg for the quality of the speakers, you don't understand why they are there. It's more for convenience than anything. At $200, you can't expect a quality 24'' monitor and ear-blowing speakers. They are still fine for most uses. Buy a pair of $50 speakers with a subwoofer and you will be happy.#2: The people complaining about the colours being different from different viewing angles, they are correct. However, the do not understand the tech. These are TN panels, which always behave in this way. If you want to have ""true"" colour and one that doesn't change from different angles (what the professionals use) you'll have to spend three to four times as much and get an IPS panel (google it)#3: They come with every cable except for an HDMI cable. You can get two HDMI cables online for $4.00 (yes, two).Finally, Newegg is always a pleasure to buy from. I placed my order at 2pm and it arrived the next day at 9:30am.",0,0

All letters are crisp and no words can do this monitor justice at the moment.Theater mode was like night and day, as when you first turn it on it is bright as the sun.I would recommend this monitor anytime but make sure you look at my cons list.",Cons:So this monitor has a horrible HIGH PITCH WHINE on it. I looked everywhere to fix it but its just so high I can hear it 7 feet away.I got my brother and dad to come in the room but they can't hear it and only my brother can hear it when putting his ear next to the top of the monitor.I feel as though this affects people with only ears that can hear a really high frequency as I got my younger friends to come in and they heard it instantly the monitor turned on.,"Other Thoughts:I'm going to be returning this monitor sadly and ordering a new box. Hopefully the newer monitor will have a less emitting sound on the ears.All in all this monitor is perfect only problem is the high pitch sound coming from inside the monitor (muted the speakers and everything)*******Oh when you first get the monitor and you're using HDMI don't freak out, the button on the left of the power button switches the display port. (for you people who don't like reading instructions)*********",3,1

Everything was WONDERFUL with this monitor.  I decided to upgrade to windows 7 professional.  I don't know why but anything that is just text against a black background, this monitor is unable to display.  Fortunetly I have my old monitor as a second monitor so I just used that while I installed win 7, then switched back.  once you are in an OS this monitor is AWESOME.  but if you ever have to deal with any text outside an os.  This monitor is unable to show it.  Good thing I VM instead of dual boot now.","Other Thoughts:oh ya the sound system on this monitor is horrible,  but it's a monitor sound system so no da.",0,4

ASUS,VE248H,4,Its OK,2012-01-20,Pros:It has good review rating and is a back light LCD.  Comes with VGA and HDMI cables for video hookup to CPU. you will need em both too sadly.,"Cons:The monitor is stupid.  If you try to hook up the HDMI to video card on start up or even after installing the video drivers the monitor will not recognize the the input.  So you end up having to hook it up as VGA  then go tot he menu and change the input to HDMI then change cables.  I think any monitor in these days that can not auto recognize whats plugged in is mildly stupid.  The colors default are wayyyyyy too bright...so just manually pick a setting you like then adjust the brightness and contrast, etc.","Other Thoughts:Personally I will go with a non back light monitor next time, most likely an ASUS and  loose the HDMI, not worth the stupidity the monitor has for not auto recognizing the input.",0,6

I expected at least something as good as my tiny laptop, but the sound from these things is just ridiculously muddled. Big disappointment. They are definitely loud enough for me, even at 50% volume, but just really bad otherwise.ASCR contrast thing is misleading. It's got nothing to do with the contrast in a particular image, it's overtime. It changes the strength of the backlight based on how bright the scene is. Unfortunately, in dark scenes for movies/TV this effectively turns off the screen, so instead of seeing the little bit of light you're supposed to see, you see nothing. Very annoying.

I really couldn't be happier.  The picture is amazing.  I had no dead pixels as others reported.  I will say I haven't used the built in speakers but I do use the audio output to hook up my pc speakers/headphones when playing the xbox.  I also like the fact that the monitor goes to sleep when the video signal goes away and comes back on when it detects it again.  This makes it handy to just turn on the last device you were using and the monitor comes to life automatically.  I spent a lot of time looking and finally decided on this model.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great DisplayPort Monitor!,2012-01-06,"Pros:* Good picture quality for general work, videos, and gaming.* 1080p is ideal for TV and movies.* The size is perfect.  I don't think I'd want much bigger than 24"".* LED backlight definitely makes some colors more vibrant.  Shades of purple and black especially look better vs. my old non-LED LCD.* The screen isn't super reflective like my old glossy LCD, yet also not rough looking like the display on my Dell laptop.  This is the first monitor I've owned that has gotten this right.  Maybe it's just a result of the LED technology though.* Aesthetics.  It's very plain looking but that's a good thing.  The border around the edge of the screen is fairly small too, about 3/4"".* DisplayPort input!  This is common on video cards but still uncommon on monitors for an unknown reason.* Other inputs: HDMI and VGA.  DVI via included DVI to HDMI cable.* No dead pixels that I've noticed.* ASUS has many well-reviewed monitors, so I hope this serves me well for a long","Cons:* Some setup is required:  It doesn't auto-detect the input type.  You have to select that with the button next to the power button.  The default brightness is way too high.  I adjusted it down to 50%.  Trace Free option: I set this to 80% and haven't noticed issues.  With ATI cards, it defaults with a black border around the picture.  You have to go into Catalyst Control Center, My Digital Flat-Panels, Scaling Options, and set it to 0%.  It's perfect after that.  I haven't needed to touch that setting again.* Stand is more wobbly than my last LCD.* No DisplayPort cable included.* No direct DVI input.  Included DVI to HDMI cable works fine though.* Not height adjustable, but unlike a previous reviewer, I find the height to be fine.  Ergonomically, the top of the monitor is supposed to be even with, or just below, eye level.  For me it is.","Other Thoughts:* I got two of these and may be ordering a third so that I have identical displays for Eyefinity 3.* I have not used the speakers.* Unlike a previous reviewer, this does identify in Windows 7 for me as ""VE248"".  No driver install was needed.* Inputs I've tested: HDMI to HDMI, DisplayPort to DisplayPort, and DVI to DisplayPort.  No noticeable difference between these.* My video card is an ATI Sapphire 100282SR Radeon HD 5850 1GB.  Connections I'm currently using: DisplayPort to DisplayPort (this monitor), HDMI to HDMI (this monitor), and DVI to DVI (old monitor).  I did discover that with this video card, you can't use 2 DVI and 1 HDMI simultaneously.  One of the DVI ports is shared with the HDMI.  That is why I wanted a DisplayPort monitor.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome,2011-12-10,"Pros:First thing to say is I research a lot before buying anything that is electronics more than anything else. I chose this model for its specs and I chose right. The image is perfect once you find out how to set it up.1- There is a nice feature where you can select preloaded visual settings for example: movie, games etc.2- Almost Plug and play.3- The visual quality is more than excellent when you set it up properly.4- I mean if you end up encountering the 3 problems listed below just follow my lead and d... you will notice a huge difference in visual quality.",Cons:The setup instructions are useless. Not that it's that complicated anyway but seriously there is definitely a lack here. It took me more than 3-4 hours in 2 days to understand why I couldnt use 2 screens and how come the visual quality was bad. I wasn't gonna give up since the screen I received was 0 dead/stuck pixels.1- The screen powered up but there was no image except a ''no signal'' message when I plugged it up from the hdmi/dvi cord and started the computer. Only my non-HDMI viewsonic screen was working. Took me 10 mins if not 20 mins to find out inside the monitor's screen menu that there is a hdmi/vga/displayport setting that you can choose to manually switch the signal from the screen to the computer. I would have avoided that headache If I had found out earlier that there is a easy access button on the edge of the screen (the second button from the right) that does exactly that kind of signal switch.,Other Thoughts:Other Cons:2- I had a problem trying to get HDMI because I was trying to use this screen in duo with a lower resolution and non-hdmi screen. What occurs is that it always reverts to the monitor with the lower resolution to have an equal resolution on both screens. But that is a normal occurence on all different brands. You can have eyefinity but it won't be in HDMI 1080p if your second or third monitor don't have that HDMI 1080p option. Your 1080p monitor will revert to the max resolution of your non-HDMI screen... I had a second monitor with max resolution of 1440x900 monitor so I couldn't get 1920x1080 where 1080 is HDMI. It would always equal 1440x900 where visual quality was not very good.3- Maybe it is because of the 3rd problem I encountered where as the monitor was reverted to a lower resolution but it was a pain in the a.. trying to find why my windows image wasn't displaying at 100% on each sides of the monitor... Fix = ATI video options - change Visual Scaling. Voilà!,5,0

ASUS,VE248H,1,Forget ASUS - 2 replacements in 7 months,2011-12-05,Pros:Decent quality display when its working,"Cons:1) Company refuses to acknowledge a known issue with the VE278Q (google ""asus ve278q flickering"" - 35,000 results don't lie, some of them Newegg reviews).I'm waiting on my second replacement monitor now - my 1st died with that issue, within two weeks of purchase.  The brand new replacement model they shipped me has lasted 5 months, and now has exactly the same issue.2) Completely misleading 'Advanced Replacement Warranty' policy.  'Advanced Replacement Warranty' - supposedly good for 3 years - is a fancy term meaning they'll ship you a refurb unit while putting a hold on your credit card for the new monitor value.  When you get the refurb, you have 14 days to return the broken monitor, or the card gets charged.  Sounds fair, except..ASUS *doesn't* tell you that they hardly ever have 'replacement refurb' stock on hand.  Your only real world option is to ship the monitor back to them, standard RMA - with a turnaround time of at least 20 business days (no holidays or wknd).","Other Thoughts:When I pointed out to the ASUS rep that this was kind of deceptive, and would leave most folks without a monitor for more than a month, he laughed.  He then said customers were free to call back - ever day - and check if a VE278Q refurb was available (in my experience the average wait time is @ 20 minutes. )I'm probably going to wind up junking this one, and buying something higher quality.  I promise you this - its my last time dealing with ASUS, and their misleading nonsense.I strongly recommend you look to some other company as well.",14,3

Battlefield 3 looks awesome and SkyRim brought a tear to my eye using the splendid scenery setting (slightly because it is super bright and mostly because that game is gorgeous).The monitor base supports the screen fine, but it is short and stubby and leaves you wanting an adjustable stand.Overall, it is worth the money.

ASUS,VE248H,5,possible fix,2011-12-04,,,"Comments:Alright, a lot of you have been saying you have had problems with this monitor ghosting,  that seems to be the biggest flaw with this monitor.  Although this may be true, the problem may not be in the monitor.  Heres my reasoningI did my research on this laptop before buying it and apparently people contacted the company and they were unable to replicate this ""ghosting"" on their models.  I began to wonder why this was.  A little more digging uncovered that some people were using what they though were cost effective HDMI cables.  Although you may not regularly be able to tell the difference between a $9 and a $100 HDMI cable, in certain cases it may cause slight input lag in such features as monitor OD or ""overdrive"".  To those of you having ghosting problems with this monitor.  I suggest you try a different input cable,  maybe DVI or a more expensive HDMI cable.  You can always return the cable if it doesn't work.  If it does then great,  your welcome for doing the research.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Decent monitor at the right price,2011-11-29,"Pros:-Plenty of screen real estate-1080p (what happened to x1200 screens?)-Bright LED back-light-Quick Response...-SlimPretty good  monitor for the price. You get 2ms (I have a gripe with this actually), LED Back-lighting (VERY BRIGHT out-of-box. Seriously, ASUS turn this thing down.), Rich, vibrant colors with deep blacks, 23.6""screen,1080p, Solid Base, Slim design, and Power saving. Also, you get HDMI, DVI-D,VGA , and sound ports. Buttons are also nicely incorporated and hidden, IMO(some people don't like it) tucked on the bottom right corner of the monitor, are easily accessible.I have this monitor on a swivel wall mount and holds up pretty snugly. Very light especially without the base at around 7lbs. Used primarily for games and movies. And I didn't get dead pixels! Yay!","Cons:LED is bright out-of-box. But that's easily remedied by wearing sunglasses and going into menu and turning it down. This I think, is why the monitor have back-light bleeding edges though. Your mileage may vary. It's not bad, hard to notice unless you have a black background.WTH Overdrive? The monitor have this 'LCD overdrive' function that basically controls the screen response time. I was told. By ASUS. IT CAUSES AN AFTERGLOW ON THE SCREEN THAT TRAILS MOVING OBJECTS. It's annoying. I look at spreadsheets and emails all day with black text on white background. Moving the cursor and scrolling causes afterglow havoc all over. QUIT IT. Luckily, you can disable 'OD' in the service menu by holding 'menu' button then turning monitor on, and pressing menu again. You have to do this every time the screen is turned off or cycled. This is probably the 'ghosting' people reports. My ACER doesn't do anything like this. VERY ANNOYING.Speakers are MEH. That is all.","Other Thoughts:Well, like everything in life- wife, kids, job, crazy neighbor that have a collection of taxidermied squirrels that he caught in the backyard... you learn to live with it. For the price, I got it for $160 with rebate, really not bad overall.If there's a firmware fix for the afterglow, please tell me. I don't mind lower response time over heavenly objects on the screen.

ASUS,VE248H,3,ASUS didn't impress with this one,2011-11-11,"Pros:This monitor is a LED backlight monitor, meaning you will save some money in power and it won't get as hot. The colours are much more vibrant compared to my VH242H, a monitor of the exact same size and resolution from ASUS. Response time is, indeed, 2ms. However, it does this by using their Overdrive feature, which is actually a con (see below).","Cons:As with other reviews, the ghosting on this thing is BAD. While playing video games or even just browsing websites, you will clearly notice the ghosting to an extreme level. When moving the mouse at a slowish level, it leaves roughly a second outline of the mouse cursor.This can be turned off, however, by turning off the Overdrive feature. This turns the response time to 5ms and eliminates the ghosting. Most people won't notice the difference. However, as this monitor doesn't seem to store that setting it must be turned off each and every time the monitor changes resolution, gets turned off or enters power saver mode. This is a VERY big hassle.","Other Thoughts:Despite the LED and the slightly cheaper price on Newegg, I believe the VH242H non-LED 23.6 LCD monitor to be a superior product. The colours are not as crisp, but you don't have to worry about resetting overdrive every single time you want to use this monitor. The ghosting and lack of stored settings and awkward buttons really make this monitor a pain to deal with.Also, for those who have the monitor or are curious on how to turn off Overdrive, you do the following:- Turn off the monitor-Hold menu and the monitor power button until it comes on.- Hit menu again and then the side buttons move the cursor to the OD (Overdrive)- Change the value to off and hit the far left button to exit the menu twice.This will need to be repeated every time the monitor changes resolution, turns off or enters power save mode.",20,1

From now on though, If I see an Asus product and it has a rebate of more than $10, I'll probably looked towards a competing product with or without a rebate.

The whole monitor looks great. The base is steady.","Cons:A couple months after purchase, the screen has started shifting to the right. I had a dvi connection. When I went into the menu settings, into image the ""size"" option was grayed out. There was nothing I could do. I bought a hdmi cable and hooked it up that way. It's even worse in hdmi. There's about a one inch(or more gap) between the monitor's edge and the screen on all four sides. And in the menu, under image, the ""size"" option is still grayed out. I called customer service and they told me that the ability to adjust the screen horizontally and vertically is only available in vga mode. The rep I spoke to thought that if I went into vga mode and adjusted it there that it would fix the issue in all modes, but it didn't.I simply have to watch in vga if I want a balanced screen now.This is absolutely incredible to me. Why would you make a monitor that people are buying specifically because it's a hd monitor, but then you make it so that the screen size/ balance cannot be adjuste","Other Thoughts:This kind of basic oversight is something that needs to be advertised. It defeats the purpose of buying hd if I now have to watch in vga mode. For the life of me, I cannot wrap my head around why they would make a monitor with a screen that cannot be adjusted if it falls out of balance.If I'm wrong then someone please help me. If I can then I'll make this a 5-egg post. Otherwise, this is an absolute travesty.",5,8

All three arrived with NO dead pixels and worked perfectly out of the box. As others described; two of the three monitors had a black border around the image on the screen. This was easily remidied by going into Catalyst control center and putting the scaling back to 0 on the two screens. After that all is just peachy.,7,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,2nd Review (type Awesome Monitor in keywords for first post),2011-09-30,"Pros:This is not a normal post. I used all boxes as one long post.The only reason I am writing this review is because of a screen problem I was experiencing. When using a DVI-D single link cable. I kept getting a flickering of the screen at random. At first I thought it could be the cable since a single link cannot handle the true spectrum and bandwidth needed, so I bought a Display port cable. But it turned out to be even worse, now the screen would go blank for no reason, but if I switch the signal on the monitor to something else then back it would reappear. So then I tried a HDMI cable, but the same thing happened as the display port. And the only thing I notice that was common was when I played video games is when it would shut of the most. Which made me think it had to do with HDCP or signal integrity since the DVI-D on flickered. So I turned off all the handshaking I could while still using a Display port connection and the frequency decreased, enough to contribute it to my chang","Cons:I knew I was on to something. Now I checked for poor signal connectors on the monitor and graphics card, and the only thing I spotted was on the graphics card. The metal from the graphics card DVI connector was in contact with the metal from my case so I lined the metal from my case with insulation tape to isolate any possible cross talk from a capacitance of the metal or ground signal, and that seemed to have helped, the frequency seemed to decrease again, but I can't be objectively sure about it. I knew I needed to try a DVI-D dual link cable now so I bought the item N82E16812119012. And that made a huge difference, the frequency of the flickering dropped to near nothing. But every once in a while, it would still do it, after hours and hours on high settings in graphics intense games. This led me to the only conclusion that it had to be the graphics card, to which I owned the AMD XFX 5830 item N82E16814150481. Plus I noticed a trend amongst the reviewers that the percentage of -","Other Thoughts:-NVIDIA card owners that didn't have any problems was higher than the AMD owners, possibly implying a hardware or driver problem on AMD cards. So I waited to post another review before I had bought a new graphics card to finally eliminate whether it was the monitor or graphics card. And I recently bought the AMD XFX 6950 item N82E16814150548, and it has not flickered since, and that's using the Rosewill DVI-D dual link cable I mentioned above. Proving that it was either the graphics card hardware itself or the software used for it, I have a feeling that if ASUS compiled all that information when people RMA to them or returned, etc. the conclusion of which one, would truly be determined.One conclusion I did come to is people jump to conclusion much to fast. So many people suspected the monitor and instead of looking for other variables they convinced themselves it had to be the monitor and nothing else. And look at how many were wrong, and how much money they cost Newegg and ASUS.",34,2

No big deal cause I can get that from a hardware store.  Turned the monitor on and I am getting a thin, flashing blue bar of pixels at the top when blacks are displayed.  Starting watching video and I am getting blue pixels where the deepest blacks should be on the screen. It isn't video cables, the monitor's input, or my computer.  I have even messed around with settings trying to get it working and no luck.  Have decided to replace in hopes that I got a bad Egg :(","Other Thoughts:I thought ASUS was a good brand, have heard many good things about their motherboards. This is my first ASUS product and I am having doubts.  With my monitor not only missing a part but having a major defect with image quality makes me questions ASUS's quality control.

When selling a 27"" monitor I'd like to have the option of a tuner as well so I can use a dual or tri monitor setup without having to have a TV as well or spend more $$$ for something that can be worked with a remote control. Currently, even though they have great monitors, asus doesn't offer them with TV tuners and therefore make poor TV/Monitor hybrids. If you're strictly looking for a big, good-looking no frills monitor then this is a great option, but if you're looking for something more than i'm sad to say you should look elsewhere.I think from now on if i buy a monitor/TV I'm going to have to play with it first and may steer clear of newegg and/or other online retailers. it really can be an unnecessary hassle if it doesn't work :/",0,0

However, it still serves me well as a second screen for much needed screen space.The performance of this monitor is outstanding. At a time when Dell and Samsung are changing $350+ for a monitor of this quality, ASUS is quietly making these monitors that go toe-to-toe with the ""big boys"".That said, the price could be lower, and should be lower. There are many high value 1080p LED back lit screens out there now that have great performance for LITERALLY half the cost. ASUS needs to drop it's pricing tier to include their DisplayPort model at this price, and this model at around the $150 price point.My suggestion: Wait on buying this until it goes on sale again.

ASUS,VE248H,2,Various issues,2011-07-23,,,"Comments:My ATEN KH1508i KVM switch and all KVM adapters have the latest firmware.The VGA output from the KVM switch was connected to the VGA input on the monitor.  Both HP ProLiant servers connected to the KVM switch have standard VGA outputs, and the screen resolution in Windows was set to 1024x768.  From what the KVM switch reported, it was 1024x768 @ 60Hz. However, the monitor constantly displayed ""Out of Range"". Even when it was at the Windows logo screen with the boot progress bar (640x480 @ 60 Hz) or at the Ctrl-Alt-Del login screen (1024x768 @ 60 Hz) or when booting into Windows PE 3.1 (800x600 @ 60 Hz), it still reported ""Out of Range"".In Win2K8 R2 the only resolution that would seem to work was 1280x1024 @ 60 Hz.Because I could not get this monitor to work right with the KVM switch, I ended up using this ASUS with my HP workstation which is NOT connected to the KVM switch. That was when I started encountering issue with DVI and the power button as described in ""Cons"" above",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,you get what you pay for,2011-07-16,,,"Comments:I purchased this to supplement a 24"" ASUS monitor that I've had for some time. The difference in going from a 1080p 24"" monitor to 1080p 27"" is very noticeable. This resolution is much better fit for a 24"" or smaller monitor. If you're using this for computer related use, not including gaming or movies, you may be happier with something different. Unfortunately 27"" monitors with more appropriate resolutions are very expensive. I suppose this opinion may vary from person to person, but realistically this resolution sucks for something this size.I'm still working on getting the colors worked out to something that looks correct to me. It is definitely taking more to set up correctly compared to other monitors I've owned. But at least I can see definite improvement so far.Mine came with one stuck pixel which has cleared up now. I am also experiencing some slight flicker that is very noticeable on dark screens and am contemplating an RMA for this reason. It is very annoying.",0,0

There is no discernible picture quality difference between the two.There is a color difference between the fluorescent backlighting of the Samsung and the LED backlighting of the Asus.  Also, Asus should really ship owners manuals in the box, although I had no difficulty finding one on line and downloading it.

It didn't present itself until I started watching some Youtube videos.I was able to easily return this to Newegg for a new LCD. Newegg gave me a shipping label to return it, and the overall process was quick, what I've come to expect from Newegg.Now, if the price goes up on this LCD, I'm not sure the amazing value of it in comparison to what you may already own. But if you're thinking about this, you won't be disappointed. My first LCD, that was 19"" several years ago was about $250, and I would have gladly paid that much for this one as well.",0,0

What a massive difference there is between the LED lighting and the standard LCD. The 1920x1080 resolution does wonders for games too, though that's not where this monitor really shines. I do a great deal of design work and digital painting, so the extra vibrant colors absolutely blew me away. Particularly beside the old monitor.

Started out with a 19"" and now I'm up to this 27"". I have to say it's my fav one so far. I have a 22"" A**r in a dual monitor setup with this one and the quality on this monitor is much better. Much brighter, sharper screen than any monitor I've owned. Picked this up from an open-box sale on Newegg paying considerably less than what is currently advertised and I'm very pleased with this purchase.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"Your move, Samsung",2011-05-03,,,"Comments:I've had Samsung's for a while, this was the cheaper LED alternative so I went with it.

ASUS,VE248H,1,READ THE ASUS PIXEL WARRANTY BEFORE PURCHASING,2011-05-01,Pros:Decent price.  Nice picture quality.,"Cons:I purchased this monitor 5 months ago from New Egg.  I turned it on a couple of days ago and noticed there was a dead pixel in the left center of the screen,  no problem I thought, 3 year warranty right?  Wrong, I called Asus and they told me that since it was less than five dead pixels it was acceptable, and there would be no replacement or repair.  So basically I am stuck with a 200 dollar, defective monitor.","Other Thoughts:Asus is not the only company with this policy, but since New Egg or Asus either one make light of this policy when purchasing a monitor, I thought I would share with potential customers so they know what they are getting.  Other than the pixel issue, and the fact that Asus apparently don't want to stand behind thier faulty products, it has been a decent monitor.",6,48

ASUS,VE248H,5,Huge and gorgeous! (That's what she said),2011-04-27,,,"Comments:Not sure if this is a 'con' or an 'other thought,' but when I hooked up this monitor to my new build, it wouldn't recognize that anything was plugged into it. I got terrified because I figured either the brand new monitor or my brand new rig was messed up, so I hooked it up to an old monitor to double check. Sure enough, it worked fine on that monitor. I then upgraded the drivers for my graphics card and this monitor plugged in and worked fine.So if you plan on using this monitor on a new build, you might want to have an old monitor lying around that you can use to install the graphics drivers. If I didn't have an old monitor to use, I would have thought something was DOA or otherwise broken in my system. Ever since upgrading the graphics drivers though, this monitor has been a giant beautiful beast.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Nice Monitor,2011-04-27,,,"Comments:I almost didn't buy this monitor because there are allot of complaints about ghosting here. Aside from that it seemed like a great monitor for the price. I saw that there was someone that said replacing the video cable fixed the ghosting issue so I started to think this isn't a monitor issue but perhaps a user, cabling, or environmental issue, like the video cable running along a power line or something.Anyway, I purchased it from a local store that I can easily return and this thing looks great. Absolutely no ghosting and sharp vivid colors. Although, to get the colors to look good I had to enable their Splendid technology in the menu. So far I tried SC2 and BC2 and they look great.Just for the record I'm using the DVI connection and have not tried HDMI, and there is no reason for me to try the VGA but all three connections are there, no adapter needed.So to sum-up, this is a somewhat large monitor with a very good picture and allot of nice features.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great,2011-04-26,"Pros:27"" for a great price. unlike other products cost too much.","Cons:A chubby LED Monitor that always make chubby cubes of pixels covering the entire screen, but it is not a stable on the screen. The cubes would most likely appear randomly at a glance, then it would disappear.","Other Thoughts:for the price this product would be a beast of all 27"" Monitors, if only Asus improved the quality of the screen dilemma of resolution.",0,6
ASUS,VE248H,2,Dead pixel,2011-04-24,Pros:Monitor works. It's very bright.,Cons:Dead pixel right in the center. They did not do quality control. They should test all monitors before shipping out a dead pixel monitor.Speakers not so great.,Other Thoughts:Expected better from ASUS.,1,4
ASUS,VE248H,5,Love It!,2011-04-23,"Pros:Super laser sharp picture, bright vivid colors, even my non tech minded wife said ""WOW!"" the first time she saw it hooked up.

ASUS,VE248H,5,this one has earned it,2011-04-23,"Pros:this monitor is very crisp, sharp. no dead pixels. brilliant color. it's the best you can get for the money.","Cons:very slight color differential from top to bottom, but they all seem to do it. it wont let me operate at 1600 x 900. i checked w/asus. just a preference.",Other Thoughts:i like the hdmi input as well as the dvi,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,wash out,2011-04-22,"Pros:no dead pixels, Always good service from Newegg",Cons:The image looked washed out no matter how you adjust the settings.  True black is grey.

The old bird has the best picture.",2,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-04-20,Pros:Good monitor for a great price.

So really the biggest con is ASUS customer service.  The support staff was unable to understand my problem, or offer any solution. After a few emails were exchanged I soon realized the support person I was communicating with had no clue. I asked repeatedly to speak with somebody else. Yet, all I received were more emails with the same advice.","Other Thoughts:Do yourself a favor and lookup ""ve248h ghosting"" and then see if you want this headache.Thank you Newegg for saving me from ASUS, and allowing me to return this defective product for a full refund and free shipping.Your the Best <3",8,3
ASUS,VE248H,5,So far so good.,2011-04-19,Pros:Large viewing area. LED makes everything look more crisp.,Cons:Factory default settings will most likely be much brighter than you are used to and will take some time to adjust them so it looks correct but once you do it is great.Wish it was 28 inches and 1920 x 1200.,"Other Thoughts:Stand seems durable but I do notice the monitor wobbles slightly at times, even when I just turn it on.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Pretty nice,2011-04-19,"Pros:Good size, good value, the picture is excellent.  Having VGA/DVI/HDMI inputs and the option to switch between inputs at any time is really handy for me.","Cons:First one arrived completely DOA.  RMA'd with newegg, got a replacement in just over a week that was fine at no cost to me.  Can't complain about that.The included speakers are garbage, don't use them if you ever listen to music, movies, etc...","Other Thoughts:The stand is strong enough, but succeptible to some resonance if you don't have a very stable desk.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great,2011-04-17,"Pros:Looks great. No dead pixels. Red light under the front when off, blue when on, so it matches my mouse and keyboard! Nice!",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:I switched to ASUS from Hanns-G because my last monitor from Hanns G went down after 2 months and I had to ship it across the country for repairs which cost 33% of a new monitor just one way. This one has a better picture than the Hanns-G and I'm probably picking up a second one. I love it.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good display for money,2011-04-17,Pros:Gorgeous HD display - ran it with both DVI and then HDMI to my Radeon 5380 GPU and everything looks great. Onboard speakers very decent as far as they go - if you can't afford surround sound just yet this is a good alternative.,"Cons:Audio was a little tricky to figure out, and website support not helpful. Ended up having to go in and tweak sound card settings on mobo to get HD sound through HDMI cable, and if you run that way plug your earbuds into the audio out in the monitor, not the front of your case.",Other Thoughts:Part of my first build:Phenom II X4 955 BEWestern Digital Caviar Black WD1002FAEX 1TBLG 10X Blu-ray burner SATA Model WH10LS30 OEMAntec EA 650W power supplyAntec 200(v2) Black ATX mid-tower caseASUS Crosshair IV Formula AM3 AMD 890FX moboCorsair Vengeance 8G(2X4G) 240-pin DDR3 CMZ8GX3M2A1600C9BXFX Radeon HD 5830 1GB 256-bit DDR5,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2011-04-17,"Pros:Very large screen, bright, great colors.  I bought this monitor because my old viewsonic died.  My old monitor was 19"" and this one is huge compared to the old monitor.  Funny thing is I got this monitor for $20 more than I payed for the 19 "" 5 years ago.  I'm really happy with the monitor, websites look great, games look great with no speed blur.  So far I'm recommending this monitor.",Cons:Slightly wobbly.  I attached a web cam to the top and had to remove it and put it on the desk because touching the desk or anyone walking in the room brought noticeable movement in the picture.  I didn't buy it for using a web cam so I didn't remove any stars.  I do not notice the wobble when I'm doing anything else.,"Other Thoughts:I recently got a Samsung P2770HD tv for my son and it looks so much bigger than this monitor.  I had to measure the screen to figure out it was the size of the bezel that was throwing me off.  The screen size was actually the same but this monitor will fit in a smaller space.  This seems to have better color to my eye and seems cleaner when playing video games... crisper.  I had to use the Samsung for a few days when I was waiting on this monitor.  I would probably have bought the Samsung for my computer but the price had gone up after the great deal I got.  I felt the specs for the Asus were better for about the same price so I went with the Asus.  I'm glad I did, and I'm a Samsung fanboy.  The Samsung is still a good monitor/tv.As usual great service from Newegg. The monitor arrived on time and in new condition.  No dead pixels and it took less than 5 minutes from box to windows booted up.  If I have any issues I'll update this review.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Ghosting drives me crazy,2011-04-16,Pros:Very lightweight and low power. Looks nice.,"Cons:There is noticeable ghosting on mine. Maybe I'm just picky but it drives me nuts. It's only really noticeable when certain colors overlap (like my white mouse cursor over the default gray window color) and only on certain portions of the screen (towards the top). You can fix the ghosting by turning off the overdrive in the service menu, effectively increasing the response time, but it turns back on anytime the monitor comes out of standby.I also noticed more flicker than a traditional CCFL backlight when the monitor's not at full brightness. I used a high speed camera to compare this monitor to a CCFL LCD I have to make sure it wasn't just my imagination. Note that if you set the monitor to full brightness then there will be no flicker. Again, most people probably wouldn't notice either way.The monitor also seems to have more discoloration from one part of the screen to another than I'm used to.",Other Thoughts:Maybe LED backlight technology isn't quite there yet in these low-cost monitors?,4,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing,2011-04-15,"Pros:Amazing quality. Love the high res 1920x1080. I was using an older 19 inch LCD from I-INC and the quality difference is just ridiculous.I love having the button on the monitor to switch between the HDMI/DVI/VGA inputs, now I can hook up my xbox on the VGA port and the PC on DVI port and leave the cables on and just press the button to switch between them on the monitor.Oh and this monitor comes with a DVI cable which is also a plus. My older monitor didn't.Amazing price for a sweet monitor IMO.","Cons:The refresh rate was said to be 50 - 76 Hz but I can only see up to 60Hz in windows 7. I am used to 75Hz from my old monitor so I kinda had a hard time getting used to the lower refresh rate, especially in games. Kinda gave me a headache for a few days when i played for too long but after a few days i got used to it and there are no problems.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Worth the buy,2011-04-15,"Pros:Great picture, plenty of real-estate","Cons:Wish there was HDMI but knew that going into it, gloss finish is the great dust collector","Other Thoughts:Don't worry about those reviews talking about ghosting and that viewing webpages is hard but games are great.. the picture is great no matter what you are doing, if you look for problems you will find them in every piece of hardware out there, this is a good product, no worries here",0,8

ASUS,VE248H,2,Disappointed with quality,2011-04-14,"Pros:Price, features and appearance.",Cons:It died after a little more than a month.,"Other Thoughts:The reviews for this monitor were great but I got a lemon. It bleeds white light around the edges and about 7 days after the 30 day return period it started flickering badly with a D-Sub cable.I changed to a DVI cable and it cleared up, but now it is back. In fact, any movement of the plug causes intense flickering and then the monitor blows up white and is unusable. I have switched cables and used different video connections. Same thing happens with D-Sub, HDMI and DVI. I'm pretty sure it is the board the connectors are mounted to. Way too much movement of those connectors without much force.Now I have to deal with Asus. The best I can hope for is repair or a factory reconditioned replacement.I'm not happy and I probably will not buy a monitor from New Egg again. I'd rather pay more and have a local store to return it to.",3,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-04-14,"Pros:Great color quality, large viewing area. The screen is very bright, maybe even too bright, but that can be adjusted easily. The base installs easily and securely without any tools needed. No dead pixels, everything looks perfect.","Cons:The speakers sound like cr@p, but I wasn't expecting much. I don't think anyone who cares about audio quality would be using the built in speakers, so I don't think it's an issue.","Other Thoughts:I like that the power light is located on the underside of the monitor; it allows you to see it without it blinding you at night. The dedicated key for switching profiles is great too, you don't have to go into the menus if you want to swap quickly.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great upgrade from a small monitor,2011-04-13,Pros:-Several preset screen modes-Sturdy stand-No dead pixels (at least upon arrival)-Plug and play-Excellent for gaming,"Cons:Certain screen modes make white backdrops a little hard on the eyes, so I've been browsing while in the slightly darker Theater mode. But it could also be that I'm still getting used to a new monitor. And i could always just reduce the brightness.","Other Thoughts:I picked this monitor solely for gaming and it's been an awesome experience so far. While using the gaming screen mode, I'm able to see darker areas of maps in games that i really couldn't see before, all the while still maintaining a balance of brightness with the rest of the playing field. If you're a gamer with a smaller screen monitor and want to make the jump to one that has a 1900x1080 resolution but not wanting something too big.. this is for you.",1,0

Really enjoyed the upgrade from a 15"" laptop screen.","Cons:Poor speakers but I use others anyways, so not really noticeable for me.",Other Thoughts:Use with an automatic hdmi switcher with my computer and xbox. Really handy and light for carrying with me if I wanna play xbox with others somewhere. Arrived to me quickly - thanks Newegg!,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Ridiculously amazing at under $200,2011-04-13,Pros:-LED-HUGE-2 MS response-1080p-DVI and HDMI-Looks really nice,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:This monitor DOES wobble a little bit if you have a garbage desk (mine is a $30 melamine unit from a big box store) like I do.  I notice that if I hold the desk still when I type the unit does not wobble so I'm going to use an L bracket to bolt the corner of the desk to the wall to stop the wobble.I have not had any blurry text or anything like others have reported although I am using DVI, not HDMI, since there is absolutely 0 reason to use HDMI over the DVI cable I already have hooked up.  Both do 1080p and who seriously uses monitor speakers anyway?  Not that this unit has them which is a plus in my opinion.  Yes the menu buttons suck but you have to mess with them once or twice ever and then forget they are even there so no biggie.Oh, no stuck pixels.  If you are unlucky enough to get one or more, try one of the programs mentioned in the other reviews to unstick them, they will very often be successful.",1,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,ASUS VE247H,2011-04-13,Pros:Excellent monitor for the price.  Solid construction.  Noticed very little in the way of flaws in the design/construction.  Can't beat this performance/quality to price ratio.  Very little glare.  Smudge resistant screen (Not the bezel/stand however).  Very bright and colorful.,"Cons:Buttons are awkwardly placed on the bottom.  Orange power button; never like orange.  Stand base is a little big and clunky, but solid.  Stiff vertical adjustment.  Found one dead (always on) white pixel middle left on the display, rather it developed since my ownership.",Other Thoughts:Good solid monitor.  You won't be disappointed.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesomesauce,2011-04-13,Pros:-great colors (at least compared to anything else in this price range)-no dead pixels (yet anyway)-decent viewing angle-very bright,"Cons:-controls work but my 15 year old CRT was more intuitive, but it cost 1500 not 150-going from a mostly dark screen to a white background (like a browser) will blind you and hurt. This isn't really a con though, just means you should turn the brightness down.-glossy finish = fingerprint magnet-speaker are a joke (and volume control is bad), but anyone who uses monitor speakers shouldn't complain about quality.","Other Thoughts:definitely buy this, especially if it's still on sale.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,great monitor,2011-04-13,"Pros:big display good speakers (sound comes from within the monitor, they are hidden) I can fit two full size window on this screen.",Cons:non that I can think of,Other Thoughts:i like how the sound comes from within the monitor.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2011-04-13,"Pros:Purchased 3x of this monitor at a local electronic store for 2D Surround Setup. They work great. All three screens load and sync at the same time. I previously had 3x Acer 23 inch LED and the third monitor always take 10 seconds to sync or load.I do not see any ghosting using DVI to HDMI (to monitor) connection. Games play great at 5760x resolution. I have not tested VGA or DVI to DVI. Should consider checking the cable (dont use the supplied cable) or graphic card drivers.The colors look great as always; it looked better than the Acer 23 inch S231hl.The frame for this monitor is quite thin and should work great in CF or SLI 2D setup. I've looked at all the available monitors in the market (4/13/11), other than Samsung's MD230, this got the thinnest frame. I plan to purchase another 3 for a 2nd 2D Surround setup.If they have this monitor with 3D functionality, that'll be even better!",Cons:Dont like the power button sticking out. What if someone wanted a landscape CF or SLI 2D Surround setup?,Other Thoughts:The speakers are bad; I simply use my own 5.1 system.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome.,2011-04-13,Pros:Great monitor at a very good price. Ordered this on a tuesday got it the very next day. I love Newegg.No dead pixels and my games look amazing.,"Cons:Speakers are laughable at best, but I bought a monitor. So if you are looking for awesome speakers on a monitor this isn't for you. I will not give it a lesser rating though because of the speakers. I game with headphones.",,1,0

I have watched videos of the ""problem"" but there is nothing like that happening with my monitor.",Other Thoughts:I tried the speakers just to see how they sound. If you are looking for high quality sound from tiny speakers in a monitor look else where. I personally did not want built in speakers. But this monitor fit my budget and wants.,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great for the $$,2011-04-11,"Pros:--HDMI and DVIMost monitors at this price range don't have DVI and HDMI although some have two HDMI which is fine if you have an adapter.--LEDThe LED makes this monitor very vibrant, the colors are great after some calibration!--NOT A SINGLE DEAD OR STUCK PIXEL!I have to say I was very impressed with this.  Not even a stuck pixel out of the box.--No GhostingAt least not any worse then any other LED monitor I've seen.  I don't know notice any when I'm streaming HD or playing games.","Cons:--Light bleedI've got a pretty noticeable bleed from the bottom of this monitor... I was expecting it and honestly it's not much worse then my friends Samsung of the same size that cost nearly 30% more than mine.--ControlsThe controls are terrible.  I hate the layout.  For some reason they put the menu button in the middle of the up/down buttons.  Stupid, but minor.","Other Thoughts:I don't see the point is spending any more money than you have to on a budget monitor.  Which this certainly is.  The light bleed might make a few people angry because on mine it is very noticeable but it doesn't really bother me that much.Oh, I haven't even tried the speakers so that doesn't factor in my rating.GREAT PRICE!",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Disappointed,2011-04-07,Pros:Great picture. The colors just popped. Sharp text.,Cons:Random screen flicker. Not normal.,Other Thoughts:Getting a refund. haven't decided if i'm getting another Asus monitor or not.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Buy,2011-04-07,Pros:Good Monitor,Cons:the measurement of the height is from the base to the top of the monitor NOT the monitor its self.,,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Sweet,2011-04-07,Pros:Simply the best monitor I have ever had.  Excellent reponse time.  Great for FPS or other games that have a great deal of action.  Colors are right on.  Simply awesome,Cons:none,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Ghosting,2011-04-05,Pros:-Nice large display-Colors are vibrant and look good,"Cons:-Major ghosting within CS-Using HDMI reduces ghosting, but there is still a large amount","Other Thoughts:If you buy this display, I'm sure it will be sufficient enough for most games you play.If you're a FPS player and you need high frames with a clean display, this may not be for you.  The ghosting is awful within FPS multiplayer games",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing...,2011-04-05,"Pros:This monitor is amazing, for the price it simply kicks Rocks! I got a $10 rebate with it to make it a total of 179 when I bought it, and I cannot find anything wrong with it, even with lower quality videos. Now keep in mind, for videos and movies it is best to see them from a little distance, gaming however does not need it. I hear people complaining about the buttons, but its more of a user not being used to them, you must hit them twice to get the to respond, it is meant so you dont accidentally hit a button. The response time is awesome, paired it with a couple GTX 560s in SLI and it is simply eye candy! Blu-ray movies look mindblowing on it, and so does everything else in my movie / video collection!","Cons:None, the small amount of color bleed is expected, VERY small amount, unnoticeable unless you are looking for it. The only place I have seen it is in white sand renders.","Other Thoughts:Great LED LCD for the price! I just have to get used to having so much screen real estate for playing wow now lol, its too big to take it all in at once.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Bad ghosting on light backgrounds,2011-04-04,Pros:Nice colors.  Pretty easy to set up.  Has tilt forward/backward option.,"Cons:When the background is white or very light (like a light yellow or blue), there is terrible ghosting that is very distracting.  This is mostly noticeable when working in documents or browsing the web.  Games typically don't have this problem because of their usual use of multiple colors, but I have seen it.  For example, if you play games with skies, like flight simulators, this monitor will likely cause you heartache.Also, there is one pixel that is stuck as grey.  Not a biggie though.","Other Thoughts:I have another Asus monitor that is only 2 years old and is having whole-monitor RGB color problems when switching resolutions.  I had another problem with Asus motherboards recently, so regrettably I will be avoiding their products from now on.  Asus QA is obviously not what it used to be.If you're looking for a good monitor, my Samsungs have been much better than my Asus monitors.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,Good for text not so much for pictures,2011-04-04,"Pros:Large screen is good for multiple excel and word documents. Decent price for a 24"" (23.6""actual) monitor. Text is sharp and clear.  No glare in sunny room.","Cons:The default Win7 desktop pictures/themes look OK but not as good as I thought they should, especially the blue sky's in the nature type pictures. Same goes for my personal pictures. The best I can describe it is that it displays ""layers"" of blue instead of a nice transition from one shade of blue to the next. I have a Radeon HD 5770 connected via DVI so I don't think it's the graphic card. The stand seems a little weak and wobbles a bit when touched.  I also had one dead (black) pixel in middle, lower right side of the screen. I hardly notice it so it's not a big deal for me.",Other Thoughts:Not bad for the price. I'm a little disappointed in the picture quality so far. I would not buy this for video or pictures. It's not horrible at displaying pictures but it's not great either. Would have given it 4 eggs had it displayed picture better.,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,2,Ghosting is unacceptable,2011-04-03,"Pros:Big screen, good resolutionCheap, easily one of the cheapest in the 23/24"" rangeGenerally good colors","Cons:Now, where do I start:First, the thing that makes me the most angry about this monitor, with ""2ms"" response time, is the fact that an enormous amount of ghosting occurs. Anywhere from scrolling down a page to moving a window around the screen creates a large ghost trail behind it. Maybe I have a bad monitor, or oversensitive eyes, but I don't know how other people don't see this. For an example gamewise, I have seen ghost trails on bullets in Bad Company 2.The second issue is the leaking. When the monitor is supposed to be showing a black screen, it has white light leaking through on all sides. And not just a little bit, it is definitely distracting when watching dark movies, or playing darker games.Another issue is that there is a very poor viewing angle; if you are anything off center, colors are very distorted.The final issue is the control scheme: The buttons are extremely unintuitive, and the on-screen menu is even worse.","Other Thoughts:In all, I was hoping to get a cheap, large, and good monitor for gaming. Unfortunatly, whether it be that I got a bad monitor, or that Asus is advertising specs falsely. This monitor is pretty bad in just about every regard.",3,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Made Me Happy Too,2011-04-02,Pros:It is much bigger that my old 19in Asus screen. The color is good and it is bright. But it is not that bright. I also received it with out any dead pixels which is a bonus.,Cons:None,,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Loving It,2011-04-01,"Pros:works well for either gaming, watching a flick or side-by-side window comparisons.typical low power consumption from LED's.  ( once you experience it, say goodbye to the others. )has all the video inputs one could ever want or ask for, its their with a pair of general speakers to boot.Gamers: Has all the goodies your looking for minus 120hz / 3D. Fast response times, big screen, 1080P and LED.",Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:Gamers: Please make sure your cards will push this monitor. If your card supports 1080P ( 1920 X 1080 ) resolutions and you want a big screen with your desktop space reclaimed, this is the guy. Please remember screen hertz is tied directly in with FPS. 1-1 ratio. No matter your in game fps, your in games fps will be capped at your monitors resolution settings. Native resolutions is what your striking for and this superb for that job. Enjoy and experience big screen at a reasonable price.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,I like VE247H better than VH242H,2011-03-31,Pros:Compared to VH242H:- Backlighting adds more contrast- Monitor is lighter and thinner --> looks much less bulky- Negligible price difference- Like the control buttons better,Cons:Compared to VH242H:- Speakers are weaker (but these are not a strong point on the VH242H either),Other Thoughts:I have a VH242H that I purcahsed <1 yr ago alongside the VE247H I bought 3/2011.  These monitors are used for data analysis so I do not know how they rate for gaming or HD viewing.,4,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Serious eye-candy,2011-03-31,"Pros:Amazing size, color, contrast, and price. What else can I say? I was scared of some of the negative reviews, but after a quick calibration via NVidia Control Panel, this baby is better looking than the brand new 21.5"" iMac's display sitting right next to it. Much brighter, and surprisingly much more colour. I couldn't be happier. :)",Cons:No delivery via quantum teleportation.,Other Thoughts:I wish I had two!,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Display,2011-03-31,"Pros:Huge!! Even coming from a 24.6 Inch monitor, the size difference is noticeable.",Cons:Lame splendid color presets.,"Other Thoughts:When I first started messing with this monitor, my eyes started to hurt.  Wondering is 27 inches may be a little too big.  I'm sure they will get used to it though.  Overall, i'm very pleased with this monitor.  Took me a while to get the color where I wanted it, and the presets weren't any help.  Much smarter presets on my old samsung, but I was able to get it there.  This is my first asus monitor after having several samsungs, and overall I am very pleased.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,3,Look for one without speakers,2011-03-30,Pros:-Monitor picture is clear and crisp.-Price is excellent for a LED display with these features.-Monitor stand is easy to remove and install with a convenient thumbscrew.,"Cons:Ordered 2 of these - both displays have a clean, crisp picture but speakers on 2nd one are making a constant popping / crackling noise regardless of volume or if a sound source is connected.  Forced to RMA 2nd screen.",Other Thoughts:Avoid monitors with built in speakers unless absolutely necessary.,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,Ouch,2011-03-30,Pros:Looks good,Cons:Hurts my eyes no matter what what I do....I gave it a week and couldn't use it.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Bought for gaming.,2011-03-29,"Pros:Price, looks, and features.",Cons:Buttons are placed on the bottom but aren't really a problem. In no way worth knocking an egg off for.,"Other Thoughts:Upgrade from a Gateway 1280x1024 bought back in like 2005 and you can notice the difference. In my current PC, I am using 2x nVidia 8500GT 512mb. These cards really hold back the performance of this monitor. I would recommend to anyone who is buying this monitor to make sure you have somewhat decent video card(s) to get to ultimate performance.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2011-03-28,Pros:Great looking monitor. No dead pixels. Came just as advertised.,"Cons:Speakers aren't great, but aren't bad by built-in monitor standards.","Other Thoughts:Got three of these to use with my Radeon HD 5870 Eyefinity 6. If you are doing the same, remember that for 3+ monitors, that every monitor past 2 has to use DisplayPort to connect to the video card. I wasn't aware of this at first and had to buy an active (has to be active, not passive) mini-DisplayPort to DVI adapter. It was about $30. I'm not terribly upset, but it was a hassle, and they don't make it very clear up front (the video card description, not the monitors).",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,,2011-03-27,"Pros:Nice, very bright picture compared to my Samsung 2220WM.  1920x1080",Cons:Ghosting w/ overdrive enabled (default).,"Other Thoughts:There is a setup menu (power on and hold menu button.  Disable over-drive from the menu (not saved after power-off).  Ghosting is gone until next powerup.Not upset with this purchase, but will probably stick with name brand LCD mfg in the future to avoid silly issues like this one.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Fantastic!,2011-03-26,"Pros:It's ASUS! One can do no wrong with this company. This is a gorgeous monitor, sometimes i even watch Netflix on this rather than my 46 inch HDTV! I do a lot of gaming and this was absolutely perfect.","Cons:Blue Energy Star sticker on the top left corner, but other than that ZERO!","Other Thoughts:If you're looking, just buy it. You won't regret it.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome monitor for the price,2011-03-24,"Pros:I also own a Dell UltraSharp monitor for photo work, and I calibrate my monitors with a Datacolor Spyder. I was looking for a cheaper monitor for general use, gaming, movies, etc. This is a gorgeous monitor! Their Splendid technology really makes the colors pop, and if accuracy is needed I calibrated this monitor with the Spyder, and it came very close to real world color. The LED backlight is bright, even, and runs much cooler. I am very happy with this monitor, and will probably buy a couple more.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:-- Regarding the negative comments about the user interface, it's not that bad. In fact it's very standard. You can't compare this monitor to a $600 Dell with a capacitive touch interface. The user interface on the Asus monitor is standard fare. Not good. Not bad. Just normal.-- I didn't have any issues with light bleed.-- I was very excited when this monitor came out because it includes a DisplayPort connection.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Nice Monitor,2011-03-21,Pros:High Definition.23.6 inches of screen real-state.Good contrast ratio.Not that expensive considering everything.,"Cons:Very slight ghosting, In fact I really do not mind that there is just a little bit.  To put it in perspective, you move the mouse pointer in a small circle about half inch on the screen and you see a bit of a trail develops it is noticeable but not killer.  However in games you probably will not ever notice it.Very bright if you do not necessarily like bright screens how ever you can lower it in the OSD menu.",Other Thoughts:Other than the ghosting that I was first wary of this is a good monitor for about 189 dollars.,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good panel especially for price,2011-03-20,"Pros:Perfect for eyefinity setup.  Price is right, display pretty.  Thin, LED, lower power.","Cons:Some ghosting in eyefinity, but only on the panel that is hooked through the active displayport adapter.  I don't believe it's the panel's problem.","Other Thoughts:Combined with ergotech triple stand and an XFX 6950 for the start of an eyefinity rig.  Even though i'm running an old core 2 duo, i can command respectable framerates by dialing back AA/detail.  Can't be a whole lot happier, unless they would do my laundry.",0,0

Play americas army and this really makes it look better than my old Viewsonic VP2030b did. Widescreen format is fantastic after my square viewsonic.",Cons:Tried the speakers just to see if I could dump my 2 channel setup. I use 5.1 headphones for most everything. Could barely hear the speakers at all and left my 2 channel setup as is. Didnt expect much from the speakers so it doesnt matter.,"Other Thoughts:did a lot of research and almost bought a 27"" but just thought it would be too big. I'm happy with the size of this Asus. Looks great with no setup and I was lucky and got no stuck pixels",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Scammed,2011-03-19,"Pros:Excellent monitor. However, at 1920x1080 HD setting only 60Hz refresh rate is available on my Mac G5 cause stay pickup. Too soon to discuss durability.","Cons:I was scammed with the $10.00 rebate. The required documentation require paper, ink and time worth more than $10. You don't get cash but an Amex Card (which only a few stores accept) after 8 to 10 weeks of wait. I will not buy any product from such dishonest company. Such deviousness also reflects on the vendor.",Other Thoughts:'Nuf said!,7,46

(Note, neither have any dead pixels)I ran a stuck pixel finder tool (just something that cycles through background colors) when I got both monitors and found that both have 2.I'm pretty picky about having no noticeable defects on my screens, but I've determined that they are not going to be noticeable under normal viewing, so I'm not going to try and return them. There are ways to try and fix stuck pixels as well so I'll give those methods a try since I am slightly OCD about this sort of thing :)That's the only thing keeping them from a 5-star rating.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Rebate Blues,2011-03-19,"Pros:Nice looking display.  Well packaged. Non glare screen sharp and steady. Menu buttons well placed and power button light glows downward and is not distracting. Unit is slim and looks as good from the back as the front. Cable connections concealed.  AND there is a 1/8"" headphone jack which I use as inputfor a separate sound system.","Cons:OSD menu took me much too long to figure out. I am sure I will forget how I did it a month from now.Full 21.5 display on VGA ONLY!  HDMI display measures 20.375 inches.Speakers just a bit better than my laptop.REBATE: ASUS makes you jump through more hoops than a circus dog, then will send you an American Express card with a  $10 credit on it.","Other Thoughts:Nice monitor for the money, but if your buying decision is influenced by the rebate, think again. The On Screen Display is a puzzle, however, after the initial set-up the ""Splendid"" button will be all I expect I will have to use.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great! (ish.),2011-03-17,Pros:-Full 1920x1080 resolution is great.-Scenery Mode of Splendid Technology is breathtaking.,"Cons:-One dead pixel showed up after only about a week.-When alt-tabbing from a fullscreen application (World of Warcraft in this case) to desktop while both are the same resolution, this monitor turns off and comes back on, resulting in a few seconds lag. This did not happen on my previous monitor. This behavior is quite annoying.These two cons forced me to dock an egg. If you could do half-eggs, I would give this monitor a 3.5/5 instead of 4/5. I expected better from ASUS.","Other Thoughts:I have not tried the built-in speakers. Frankly I would have preferred the monitor not have them. I don't like paying for things I don't use. However, they don't interfere with my gaming experience and I do appreciate the convenience of having them if my good speakers ever fail.",0,0

Not really a con tho, because everyone is different.","Other Thoughts:I was going to get the slightly smaller LED back lit Asus, but I chose not to. It was well worth it.

ASUS,VE248H,4,It has its quirks..,2011-03-15,"Pros:Well, for one, it's a 24"".But seriously, It's a really good monitor. One of my friends had a monitor that had 'blurred' movement when playing games/movies/etc. from a console or desktop - there is none of that when using this monitor unless the game is programmed to do so.Fast response time, quick refresh rate, great contrast ratio, i could go on... all in all, it's generally what you need.","Cons:It doesn't seem to ""auto-detect"" inputs, which is a nice feature to have on any monitor.Currently I have plugged in VGA, HDMI, and DVI. If you were to turn on one, the monitor will still search for input from the last used source. If nothing is on HDMI, it will stare at you like an idiot until you turn it off, turn it back on, and quickly hit the 'source' button to switch it to DVI. Switching between one and the other have been a pain.Also, there aren't many 'advanced options'. The only choices you really get are: sharpness, brightness, contrast, and saturation. All the others are just mostly 'on/off' features.","Other Thoughts:It does seem a little bright at times, but you have 5 different profiles with which to adjust for any particular situation.The DVI input seemed a little funky. It was different from the adapter I got with my EVGA GTX470, but there is also an HDMI port - and more adapters, so no problem there.Honestly though, I can't say that I'm disappointed",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,It has its quirks..,2011-03-15,"Pros:Well, for one, it's a 24"".But seriously, It's a really good monitor. One of my friends had a monitor that had 'blurred' movement when playing games/movies/etc. from a console or desktop - there is none of that when using this monitor unless the game is programmed to do so.Fast response time, quick refresh rate, great contrast ratio, i could go on... all in all, it's generally what you need.","Cons:It doesn't seem to ""auto-detect"" inputs, which is a nice feature to have on any monitor.Currently I have plugged in VGA, HDMI, and DVI. If you were to turn on one, the monitor will still search for input from the last used source. If nothing is on HDMI, it will stare at you like an idiot until you turn it off, turn it back on, and quickly hit the 'source' button to switch it to DVI. Switching between one and the other have been a pain.Also, there aren't many 'advanced options'. The only choices you really get are: sharpness, brightness, contrast, and saturation. All the others are just mostly 'on/off' features.","Other Thoughts:It does seem a little bright at times, but you have 5 different profiles with which to adjust for any particular situation.The DVI input seemed a little funky. It was different from the adapter I got with my EVGA GTX470, but there is also an HDMI port - and more adapters, so no problem there.Honestly though, I can't say that I'm disappointed",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,ASUS Packs a punch!,2011-02-23,"Pros:Color representation: Beautiful colors especially utilizing the Splendid modes. Standard mode is a bit washed out, but can probably be adjusted utilizing contrast/brightness controls if you really wanted. But why use when there are a few great presets available. (Theatre, game, scenery, night view, standard)Clarity: Images are sharp and detailed, especially in the native 1080p mode. 720p is fine for me for how close i am to the monitor ~3ft.  Would definitely use 1080p more if i had an HD video source setup, but overkill for work use, in my opinion.Size: 21.5"".  Plenty of visual real estate to go around.Power Consumption: ~18W when 100% brightness...which i could get a sunburn from. ~70% brightness is perfect which is around 15W of power (according to my Kill-a-watt)...not bad for a ~22"" widescreenInput options: This monitor has it all.  One VGA for my dell work PC for home office use, one HDMI for my personal macbook pro, and one DVI for my old gaming rig","Cons:Pixel:One bright dead pixel, sucks... but only noticeable with a completely dark background, and if you focus on it..which i do sometimes, but wont knock down a full star/egg for that.Speakers:Probably worse than my laptop speakers, but better than nothing, if you dont have any. But who buys a monitor for the speakers anyway? :)Controls:Not very intuitive, but once it's setup, I dont touch it.","Other Thoughts:Exceptional product for the cost. Great price/value ratio and jam packed with features, functionality, and low energy usage thanks to the LED lighting. Everything I needed and then some.",9,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,very nice,2011-02-23,"Pros:Gotta love cheap chinese panels. Truly remarkable color vibrancy and depth, which is hand in hard with the phenomenal contrast. Blackest blacks since the crt days, imo. Not to mention only a 21.5 inch display packed with 1080p delivers very impressive pixel density.","Cons:I find it somehow wrong to complain about minor flaws on an otherwise beautiful display priced below buck fifty, but I did notice light bleed on the margins, and the green color can seem somewhat neonish yellow, although I've witnessed instances in which the green can be displayed richly and with much depth.",Other Thoughts:If anyone can relate to the cons mentioned please tell me I aint crazy at least.,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,Almost good.,2011-02-23,"Pros:Decent color accuracy for TN panel.  Plenty of connection options (DVI, VGA, HDMI) for accepting input from almost anything. Price.",Cons:Had severe ghosting issues on my system.  Scrolling down a page of text left behind a complete afterimage of the text.  Slight juddering during video playback.  Ghosting/Tracing issue present in all office and gaming uses.,"Other Thoughts:Apparently the ghosting is a widespread issue with this monitor, but doesn't occurr on all of them.  Sometimes it's a matter of being connected to an nvidia vs ati video card.  But A) I'm not buying a new videocard just so my monitor stops ghosting and B) That's still a defect.  So if it works for you without tracing issues, great monitor.  Otherwise...look elsewhere.",1,0

Wish the first thing that came up was actual adjustment options and not just preset color/brightness modes. You have to dig a bit to get to those.,"Other Thoughts:I'm confused by the speakers. Using them with the included audio cable to my computer produces barely any effect, even with the volume on the monitor set to max. However, when using my ps3 the sound transmitted through the HDMI is more than loud enough and I actually have to turn it down sometimes.I have actual speakers for the computer so that's a non issue and the ps3 performance is actually a plus.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Nice display with some setbacks,2011-02-22,"Pros:- Nice display, looks great.- Controls are not as bad as others pointed out.- Colors are good, they need to be tweaked initially, but what display doesn't from the factory?",Cons:- Ghosting that others mentioned is real. I have determined that it's not enough for me to return the display. Only noticeable with small black type over a grey background. Not that extreme in my case.- Internal speakers are lame.,"Other Thoughts:I am using an AMD 4000 series chipset for the GPU. Some people have mentioned the ghosting effects could be worse on Invidia, not sure though.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,EXCELLENT,2011-02-21,Pros:Nice and bright (when you need it to be)lots of real estate. (totally dual side window in 7 and still be comfortable)no dead on arrival pixelsbrilliant color and high definition.,Cons:only came with one monitor!,Other Thoughts:I do lots of graphics and animation so having a good screen is almost essential.

Lots of control options.","Cons:HATE...the rebate process..guess I don't have to apply but will. Must make app for form, download, then fill out form adding upc code,other paperwork, etc. Then cut out printed mailing label. Mail and wait 8 to 10 weeks for the full rebate. $10.

ASUS,VE248H,4,1 Of 2,2011-02-20,Pros:-Price-1920 x 1080p-Extremely bright display-Very dark colors contrary to LEDs not being able to produce the darkest blacks-Firm Buttons to adjust between settings,"Cons:-Speakers are really really bad, maybe even terrible(I bought it knowing that)-Very flimsy base-which Topples over easily-Gloss frame collects fingerprints","Other Thoughts:I bought two of these monitors. One of them has a dead pixel. Thus the 4 eggs.Be sure to have this on a very sturdy desk or table because the monitor will topple over. Just pushing the buttons forces the monitor to start wobbling!Other than that, I do recommend the monitor.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very nice display,2011-02-20,"Pros:Clear screen, no shadowing, HDMI input, ran it straight for 24 hours and had NO dead pixels.",Cons:Very quiet sound,Other Thoughts:Bought this for my daughter so she can watch TV in her bed at night as she has a habit of waking up in the middle of the night and just about waking everyone up.Being that the speakers are quiet and that the sound is handled via HDMI this was a perfect setup and was mounted to the ceiling.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,great product,2011-02-20,"Pros:very fast refresh, perfect clarity, and is very bright and dark at the same time",Cons:none,Other Thoughts:well worth more than the price,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,nice monitor but do your research,2011-02-19,Pros:Excellent color and adjustment options. Running through Windows 7 color calibration really perked everything up. No dead pixels.,"Cons:I notice the ghosting that these monitors are known for. Do a search for this model and ghosting for more info and YouTube videos. Using the monitor and graphics card settings, I was able to tune out most of the ghosting out but it is still noticable over light colors. I think I can live with it so I'm only knocking one egg off.",Other Thoughts:This is an update to a review I left on 2/8/2011. This second monitor came working as opposed to my first DOA unit. Newegg took care of me all the way.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,absolutely awesome...,2011-02-19,"Pros:fantastic picture, presets are good, LED backlighting makes images really ""pop"", versatile inputs (HDMI, DVI, and VGA? yes please!), speakers (not really great but passable), beautiful glossy finish on cabinet, and for the price it really can't be beat!","Cons:as many have mentioned, the speakers are ""tinny"" and you really would want something else, but one thing many overlooked was the fact that you have the line-in input and also a headphone jack, I'm using my monitor as a pass-through for my headphones.","Other Thoughts:I read many reviews before purchasing, so I was aware of the normal complaints, but as an average user I really LIKE the glossy finish (yes, it picks up fingerprints, but who is constantly handling their monitor?), the presets looked fine for me (I suggest using Monitor Calibration Wizard, though, great little program and it's free), and for the price I think a lot of reviewers are being unfairly nit-picky. LED backlighting is really a huge upgrade to my eyes.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,I love ASUS,2011-02-19,Pros:Beautiful 1920x 1080px displayFull 1080p HD SupportWorks Wonders for an Xbox 360No Dead Pixels,"Cons:Speakers don't get very loud but its a monitor, the fact that they are there is rather impressive.","Other Thoughts:Running my laptop through the display results in a very bad flicker, although this could be due to my low end video card.Nvidia Geforce 7000M / nForce 610MOther than that, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, my only hope is that when it comes time to build my desktop the DVI port wont have the same results as the VGA port.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,So Awesome I bought two.,2011-02-19,"Pros:Some of the best picture quality I have ever seen. Top notch for videos, games, and media. The presets come in really handy actually.A number of reviews have stated they see ghosting in games and such. No account of that for mine.",Cons:The speakers suck. Who buys a display like this and doesn't have real speakers anyway? Just make the display cheaper and lighter and leave them off.,Other Thoughts:Asus makes rock solid stuff. No dead pixels. No hiccups. Powers on every time and looks wonderful doing it. I am dual monitors with them and its a happy world around here.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Worst Monitor Experience,2011-02-18,Pros:- Awesome Picture and great Brightness- Wonderful feathers such as Picture in Picture- Display Port at a very reasonable price!- Easy to assemble- Easy to use menu system,"Cons:These are the problems i've had on two of this monitor- The Monitor does not autodetect which display is plugged in, meaning unless you have the right cable to plug in you are doomed  (the default seems to be DVI)- The Monitor does not autodetect sound- The Monitor cannot be turn off when the computer is on, otherwise it will not turn back on, in order to turn it back on I have to turn off the computer, unplug the monitor's power and then put it all back together and try again.- The Monitor oddly ruins sound, I have my sound go from my video card to the monitor to my speakers and for some reason this is the only time I've seen media and even games with varying degrees of volume - I tested with my old ACER and NEC monitors, it is the ASUS Monitor.- Use Picture in Picture w/ caution, you can apparently break the monitor - since it doesn't auto detect you can basically get it to the point that no Display Interface port will work.","Other Thoughts:When I first got the monitor I thought it was broken, but the RMA has the exact same issues, and rather than pay another $30 for the return shipping I decided to stick with it. So long as I don't move the monitor to a different computer or turn it off, it techincally works.I have to say that I am very disappointed with Asus, I cannot believe my old Acer Monitor was better designed than this much higher end one.",3,9
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very nice monitor,2011-02-18,Pros:Very bright. No dead pixels at least I don't see any. I like the that the power light is orange in stand by mode. It works...,Cons:Non to date,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Monitor surprised me,2011-02-18,Pros:Bright screen. Base is solid. Works great with my Xbox using the HDMI input. I was surprised at the quality. Brought it to work (IT shop) and the techs all thought the image was excellent for the price. We have Samsungs here too...it was very comparable to those.,"Cons:Minimal base adjustments available. Found that when running both VGA and HDMI inputs (Xbox and computer), we weren't able to switch between them.",Other Thoughts:Excellent monitor for the cost conscience buyer.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Meh?!,2011-02-17,"Pros:This unit is fantastic, except for a few minor flubs. The screen is visual heaven. It is a wonder of a display. And that's about it.","Cons:Built in speakers do not function or are at low volume. In my day job, I trouble shoot this stuff all day long. I think this unit just has a bad or weak audio board. The built in screen menu is very non-intuitive and I cannot for the life of me get it to work. FAIL.","Other Thoughts:The HDMI port doesn't push audio, see above. All in all, I am ""ok"" with this, I may be returning it for another unit due to the audio issues. But I do have external speakers hooked up and really don't care that much. For the price, and for the stunning visual display, well worth it.",3,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,Defective,2011-02-17,Pros:Wouldnt connect so i dont know.,Cons:None of the inputs worked,Other Thoughts:I got this pretty fast but to bad that doesnt matter. when i turned it one there was a lone pixel which seemed to be in the middle of the screen so i was like i hope this isnt a dead pixel. I then tried to connect that VGA cord to my computer and no dice.  I called customer service and all they said was send it to whom you bought it for...Pretty mad.,1,16
ASUS,VE248H,1,Ghosting is still present,2011-02-17,Pros:Again the colors are still good for a TN panel and the screen size is good. The bezel is pretty small and would be great in a eyefinity setup if there wasn't one major problem,Cons:I RMAed the first VE248H for ghosting and its replacement which I just received has the same issue. I've come to the conclusion that all these monitors have the ghosting issue present and the people leaving positive reviews do not understand what ghosting is. If I were ASUS I would have put out a product recall and fixed this problem instead of denying it's existence.,"Other Thoughts:At first I thought I received a lemon but the replacement has the exact same issue.I think I'll just keep the monitor seeing as I can't return it and RMAing it will just waste more money (it cost me $30 to ship the first monitor) for another ghosting monitor.I'm honestly not going to buy another ASUS monitor for a long time after this. I'll stick to companies like Viewsonic, Samsung, HP, Dell, and NEC for next monitor",6,3
ASUS,VE248H,4,,2011-02-17,"Pros:great picture, lots of picture options, sceen is the perfect size for my taste","Cons:wish the spreakers had just a touch more bass, but still sounds good",Other Thoughts:dont think there is a better deal for the money,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Flat out fantastic,2011-02-17,"Pros:Beautiful colors and contrast.  Screen seems huge even though I am only going from a 21.1"" to a 24"" it is much larger then I expected.  The height of the screen is nice and the overall picture does not look scrunched like so many of the 'wide-screen' monitors are.","Cons:No vertical adjustment.  Not a problem for me since my computer desk has a monitor stand that adjusts up and down.  Other then that so far this monitor is a dream come true.  Also, no drivers for Windows 7 that I can find.  Works ok with the generic drivers but would be nice to have certified windows drivers for this bad boy.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Average,2011-02-17,"Pros:Price, LED backlit, DVI and HDMI connections. Fast delivery.","Cons:It bleeds color and light in the corners and along the edges. Its not bad, but not what I expected either",Other Thoughts:This monitor got 5 eggs with lots of reviews so I bought it on sale with free delivery. Debating whether to return it for a Samsung. I wonder if it will look better using the DVI connector?,1,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Nice monitor for the price,2011-02-17,Pros:This monitor is big at first i didn't know if it would even fit on my desk. The clarity is amazing its like looking through a window at times. I played deadspace on it  with a pny nvidia 9800 gt 1024mb and whoa it was amazing how much clearer everything looked.,Cons:It didn't set itself up for me.,Other Thoughts:I was using a monitor with a 12inch screen before so i was in amazement at the sheer size and clarity. I'll report back if i have any problems. Great monitor for starcraft 2.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Love these monitors,2011-02-16,Pros:WOW I recieved these monitors and they look totally awesome. I ordered 4 of them and none with any problems. Love the warranty on these puppys.,Cons:none to date,,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome Monitor!,2011-02-16,Pros:-Amazing color-Fast Response time-Large size-HDMI Input-HDCP Support-Full HD Resolution!!-Sturdy base-Price,"Cons:The menu is a little wierd, but most monitor menus are. I am having trouble coming up with any cons. The speakers aren't very good, but I expected that.","Other Thoughts:I really cannot come up with any substantial cons for this monitor. Initially I didn't really like the color, however after playing with the settings I love it! I also like that there is a button to change inputs, my old monitor required going through the menu. It is much brighter than my old LCD screen. Also the screen size looks much larger than I thought it would be. Overall I am very happy with this monitor, and got it at a great price.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,wow,2011-02-16,"Pros:No dead pixels, just looks amazing.Comparing it to my older acer monitor you can view this monitor at any angle and still see a bright colorful screen.LED is the way to go if you plan on buying and LCD monitor now a days.",Cons:none.,Other Thoughts:even has a smart button i press when i game to set the correct setting. Colors and brightness is jaw dropping.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Minor disapointment,2011-02-16,Pros:Excellent picture and extremely vivid colors using HDMI input. Easy to adjust and PWR button is on the bottom where it won't shine in your eyes.,"Cons:Two of the display modes are useless. When using 'Night View' or 'Standard' modes, I get patches, blotches, and streaks of an off-white discoloration in any normally white background regardless of bright/contrast or video board settings. I just always leave it in 'Game' mode where I get the best results.","Other Thoughts:For the price I really shouldn't complain but when I pay for 'Night View' and 'Standard' modes, I expect them to work whether I use them or not. My Sapphire HD5870 can successfully drive my 46"" JVC HDTV without breaking a sweat, so don't even think about trying to tell me I need a better video board if I expect this monitor to work properly. Don't offer me a replacement either if you're going to bill me for the shipping. You almost 'gaffed' me for $149 to ship a HDTV to California.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent Monitor,2011-02-16,"Pros:Good price for a 24"" monitor.No dead pixels.Good picture quality.Low power consumption.",Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:I haven't utilized the built-in speakers, so I have no idea if they're any good or not.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,This Should Be a Shellshocker,2011-02-16,"Pros:$15 Promo Code + $10 Rebate brings price down.  Even without the rebate, this monitor is still a great deal.  Full HD 1920x1080 LED back-lit with 0.248 dot pitch.  Any dot pitch greater than 0.25 takes you back 20 years to the 17"" Sony Trinitron tubes.  HDMI, DVI, and VGA inputs w/ input select lets me switch between computing and watching DTV.  Panel edges are thin, square, and simple without fancy curves and angles.",Cons:Stand can be a little taller so I don't need to use phone books.  Deep greens appear yellowish no matter how I tweak the monitor settings and Windows background color.  A monitor with specs like this does not need speakers.  ASUS could have left the speakers out and given me an HDMI cable or charged me $10 less.,"Other Thoughts:Shipped without any Newegg packaging and the ASUS tape seal seemed partially removed prompting me to ""check contents immediately if seal is broken"".  Perhaps some added tape with a Newegg logo securing the original box would ease my paranoia.",1,1
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great Monitor for the price,2011-02-16,"Pros:Clean picture, well worth the money. I haven't experienced any ghosting or dead pixels. A good buy.",Cons:Don't buy it for the speakers. Even with all volume controls maxed out it's still quiet.,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great monitor,2011-02-15,"Pros:Bright, big, good value.  No dead pixels, easy to get up and running.","Cons:Trying to manually adjust settings is a little difficult to get used to.  Asus could probably have thought a little more about the buttons, or maybe it is just because you cannot see them that makes it hard to use.  Not really a big deal to me though as I got it setup and dont need to touch them again.","Other Thoughts:Very happy, would recommend.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Great when working,2011-02-15,"Pros:Bright, vibrant colors.  Was HUGE, quality casing.","Cons:Would flicker at random, seemed to change resolutions and invert the colors.  Would flicker black as well.  Had to RMA it and newegg took really good care of me.",Other Thoughts:I know alot of people have been having this issue.  One of my guild mates got the same monitor and his is working like a charm.  Just a hit or miss.I love you newegg!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,So So,2011-02-15,Pros:HugeFull HDClean and simple bezelStatic images look great,"Cons:A whole lot of ghosting.  Looks like a dark purple shadow following everything, particularly noticeable in games...which is what I do the most with this.","Other Thoughts:I'm a bit disappointed in the ghosting since it is extremely noticeable and distracting.  Also after much researching prior to the actual purchase, no one else appeared to have experienced any issues similar to what I'm having.  I'll just have to be more careful in the future.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing,2011-02-14,"Pros:Probably the most amazing monitor for the price. EVERYTHING looks amazing on this monitor, if you're even thinking about it, get it.",Cons:None,,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Everything looks small compared to this.,2011-02-14,"Pros:The large desktop area is great for working on two documents or spreadsheets at once.  The gloss black finish on the bezel and stand is nice - just don't touch it.  The black level is significantly better than my older LCD's and there's enough contrast/brightness for almost any situation.  Bottom mount buttons are out of the way and easy to use.  For such a large monitor, the stand is surprisingly sturdy and well made.  Zero dead pixels.","Cons:I was a little worried about the 'ghosting' issues after reading some of the earlier reviews.  Out of the box, there were some noticeable white trails when moving black text or the mouse across gray backgrounds.  I was a little disappointed but after calibrating everything, the white trails are much less apparent and the color is great.  My 22-inch CCFL LCD ASUS at home was a little easier to calibrate.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this for personal use at work (since my employer won't buy anything larger than a 19-inch LCD).  After over three weeks of 8-hour+ per day usage, I am very satisfied.  The LED backlighting is perfect for the bright office environment.  I have to stop reading reviews as it makes me look for problems that really aren't that big of a deal.  For the sale price plus rebate, this is a fantastic deal.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent,2011-02-14,Pros:This 21.5in Asus monitor is amazing. I recently had bought a Radeon 5770 and now I get to utilize it's HDMI abilities with this monitor.  I ordered this product Thursday evening. It arrived Friday morning. Unbelievable.,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:It was tricky getting audio back on speakers instead of it trying to play on the monitor. Took some time, but I got it. I'm a happy camper.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-02-14,"Pros:Like others have said, the image quality is amazing. Almost as good as my XBR4...",Cons:Nothing yet....,"Other Thoughts:When I first hooked this up, the sound and video quality sucked badly. After i installed all the drivers from my build, everything came together very nicely. The sound level is about the same you get from a typical laptop, so don't expect tv level volume from this. I got pretty much exactly what I wanted from this monitor.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Quality for a Great Price,2011-02-14,"Pros:The viewing angle along with the widescreen view allows ease of use and easy set up on the corner desk I own.  HDMI!!!For 144.99!!  Amazing price plus I get $10 rebate.  Setup is a breeze and Menu options are easy to access (I know some people had a problem, I thought it was quite clear).   NO DEAD PIXELS!!  Picture is Sharp, Bright, and Gorgeous.  Ordered on a Thursday, received on Friday!",Cons:Are you kidding?  It's full HD with HDMI for 144.99!,"Other Thoughts:I edit HD video and this was the last piece to my puzzle when building my computer.  (i7-950, ASUS Sabertooth Motherboard, EVGA GeForce GTX 460, 160 GB Velociraptor HDD, WD 1TB HDD [6 gbs, 64mb cache], 6gb corsair dominator 1600 ram)  With this monitor I can finally see the full processing capability of this machine, and it's fast, responsive, and beautiful.  It's a breeze to work on, and because of the widescreen view there really isn't any reason to have 2 monitors when editing.  Glad newegg had such a great deal.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,led is cool,2011-02-13,"Pros:almost 24 inch for $180, led means low power consumption.","Cons:they kind of wobble side to side if my desk gets bumped.I purchased three of these and and on all three the default settings looked different from each other (color, saturation, gama ) i had to fine tune each one th get them to look alike.I would think that they would look almost exactly the same, as far as image quality goes.",Other Thoughts:Considering they are led i would have imagined them to be thinner.,0,4
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Great value, solid picture",2011-02-13,"Pros:<$200 can't be beat. With HDMI, DVI and VGA connectors, VESA-compatible, 2ms response, 1920x1080 resolution and great contrast ratio makes for a good feature-set.","Cons:Minus one egg for the menu-OSD. It pretty much sucks.  Speakers, It has them but they're worthless really.",Other Thoughts:I bought 3 for tri-monitor setup and they work well. Bezel isn't too big.  The monitor is not as skinny as other LED/LCDs in the market but they don't weigh much at all.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Fantastic,2011-02-13,"Pros:It is huge. I went from a 19inch to this and the difference is crazy. Arrived with no dead pixels, no bleeding, etc. I haven't noticed any ghosting either. I don't know why people complain about the buttons. You press one button to cycle through inputs it is pretty common sense. This monitor has it all for an amazing price. To get something that would compare from dell, lg, or hp you would have to pay 100 dollars more.","Cons:It is a hard core dust magnet. I've had it for 2 days now and the back side is almost completely covered. The speakers aren't the greatest, but who buys a monitor for the speakers? Some people said they were quiet, but at 70-100 it is pretty audible.","Other Thoughts:I have my computer and my new 360 slim hooked up to this bad boy and I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. 3 year warranty, top notch manufacturer, and again newegg has yet to fail me. Be prepared to be in awe at how big this monitor actually is. I knew it was 5 inches bigger than my old one, but it is literally twice the size in width and is about 1/8th inch shorter than my 19inch. I have them both hooked up to the computer now so I can check my facebook while waiting in a lobby in black ops.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Disappointng,2011-02-12,Pros:Color is excellent,"Cons:Can't find a driver for Win 7, so doesn't have full support for the 24 inch screen.    Speakers are weak.Might want to check other options that have driver support.",,0,8

ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Attractive finish. EGGCELENT MONITOR!,2011-02-11,"Pros:The price was absolutely stunning, newegg came through for me on this one. Its really a great monitor, I enjoy the finish, its lighter than my 23"", and its LED, so thats great. I have yet to try the hdmi or the speakers on this so I cannot review them. I am quite impressed over the jump from my previous acer 23"". Colors are nice","Cons:Nothing is really special about this monitor. Perhaps I need to calibrate it to my liking but I just felt like the color schemes were off with the auto button, putting it into cinema mode didn't really help even with the lights dim. Although, I see no reason to dock eggs, this is a great buy, I am very happy with it. It works nicely and games do look great on this. So no real cons.","Other Thoughts:I can't really see too much of a difference between LED and LCD, but in a way it kind of pops more. This is my first LED monitor that I've owned though. If you can find a better deal then take it, otherwise this is a good name, and a good buy. EGGCELENT!",5,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Asus VE248H,2011-02-11,Pros:This is an awesome monitor. It really is much better than I expected considering some so-so reviews. I had done a lot of research and in-store shopping prior to purchase and was almost convinced I would have to spend at least a $100 more if I wanted a high quality LED.,Cons:Does not come with a HDMI cable so grab one here for $4.99 before you check out (they are $35 + tax at the store).,Other Thoughts:I have shopped everywhere and this is the best deal you will find.,2,0

Fiddle some more and you'll get it to look good","Cons:Takes too much ""fiddlin'."" Controls not intuitive and presets weren't well developed.","Other Thoughts:Minus one egg for some basic flaws as mentioned. Doesn't auto detect the input and you may have to actually read the manual to figure out how to get it out of the VGA input mode.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing!,2011-02-11,"Pros:Very bright and crisp picture, also does not get hot due to lower power consumption from the LED.","Cons:Buttons are under the monitor, kind of annoying.","Other Thoughts:I had a 24"" lcd monitor from asus, and it started flickering, so I sent it back and newegg refunded my money, so I got the led version of this monitor and I love it! games look great, pictures, videos, and the 1080p resolution is awesome.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Nice monitor,2011-02-11,"Pros:Price, resolution, HDMI, LED (energy efficient), 24"", bright, very nice sharp picture, understandable menu, serious brand.",Cons:As many reviews said there is a ghosting problem (read other thoughts); response time (what makes ghosting); wish it had no speakers (you'll need them only if you don't want to pay extra buck for good sound or if you want to save some space on your desk).,"Other Thoughts:I owned 23"" Samsung P2370 for year until it broke. I had to deal with Customer Support for 3 months and ended up with BBB's help. I got my money back and invested them into this unit. Since I've had positive thoughts about ASUS. After reading so many reviews about pros. and cons. of top selling monitors, I made my decision to buy this one. Many people complaints about ghosting, it's not a big deal. You won't find monitor with faster response time. 2 ms is not real response time for many monitors (my old samsung had the same issue). Stable response time you can get in TN panels is 12 ms. Of course you can get it faster but on high action scenes it will be slower. Example can be even shaking a window with text or movie, playing shooters, sports games. I tried Dell Ultra Sharp U2211H (IPS panel 8 ms) that my friend owns. It has the same issue. You can go to any store and try different models, it will be a waste of time for you. Only CRT monitor will give you no ghosting.",5,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,"Decent, but one major flaw",2011-02-11,"Pros:- Great price for a 24"" LED screen- Great looking display, once it is calibrated (See below)- VESA mounting- HDMI, DVI, & VGA inputs- HDCP compliant on the DVI input","Cons:- All of the built-in ""Splendid"" configurations look really bad.- ASCR is not usable (at least, on the monitor I purchased)- Significant ghosting occurs when black items are moved against a white background. Very noticeable when drawing / moving lines in MS Word or Visio, for example. The ghosting occurs regardless of whether ASCR turned ""On"" or not (I was hoping this was just an artifact of ASCR, but it isn't). Also noticeable when just moving a black cursor against a white background.","Other Thoughts:The VE247H is a really good monitor, but it has some significant flaws:- The pre-set ""Splendid"" configurations are anything but ""splendid"". All of them were obnoxiously bright and overly contrasted.- The color temperature is pretty far off target. For example, the ""Normal"" setting for 7500K was closer to about 6700K.- Using the ""Theater Mode"" (since it allowed for a lot of control), and ""User Mode"" for the Color Temperature, I calibrated my display using SpectraCal's new CalPC software along with my Chroma5 Colorimeter. Everything looked really great after calibration.- The ASCR (Asus' dynamic contrast feature) is basically useless. When the screen contained a large amount of black, the entire display went totally blank. This occurred during full-screen videos, and during PC bootup (blanked during BIOS info display and the Win7 glowing flag), for example. This may be just my monitor - I will replace my monitor and update with what I find.",2,1
ASUS,VE248H,1,missing parts,2011-02-11,Pros:nice monitor for the cash.,"Cons:bought 4, 2 missing arms that attach monitor to base.Contacted asus to get replacement, extreamly long wait time to get to service rep, then had to call back to get sales and wait again, then only to have yet another call back to service and long wait, just to get the responce that it was not their fault and I shuld return the monitors. The asus stickers were intact on the boxes, 'Not their fault' what elves removed the parts?","Other Thoughts:Lousy customer service, extreamly long wait time on hold, multiple calls. I will not buy another asus",6,4
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitors,2011-02-11,"Pros:Lightweight, Great Color and Clarity.  No ghosting and little to no bleed as far as I can see.  Wonderful monitors.",Cons:You need to tune them to your liking.  Nothing I would take an egg off for since all monitors must be tuned to their environment for the best image.,Other Thoughts:These travel around with me and they have been holding up well to the stresses involved.,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent,2011-02-10,"Pros:LED, perfect color saturation, perfect blacks  for LED/LCD, quality and size. This thing is amazing. Only monitor I have that can compete with this one is my plasma. Great colors, true blacks and NO ghosting. I'm not sure what happened to a couple people with ghosting but I have not seen it. My monitor is perfect with no dead pixels. I couldn't be happier. I am considering getting a second for my other PC. @ 189.00 how can you go wrong? As usual, super fast shipping from Newegg!",Cons:Nope.,Other Thoughts:Should have bought two right away.,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,h@ly $*** real estate:),2011-02-10,Pros:All pros!!!....24 inches of pure awesomeness...buttons are just fine once you know what does what. The stand is great considering the size of the monitor. no goasting that i can tell yet....(i tested it on my dads old dell pentium 4 and it had a great picture. And its no brighter out of the box than any other monitor i have used.no dead or stuck pixels!!,Cons:not really a bad thing but it just fits in my desk....its pretty darn big!!! dont think i would go any bigger.,Other Thoughts:Bought it with the $20 off promo....worth every penny even at full price. I would recommend this monitor to anyone and i would buy it again. cant wait to use it with my soon to be new SB build.Props to Asus for building a great product and to Newegg for selling it!,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2011-02-10,Pros:Looks fantastic.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Have it all connected with HDMI for audio and video and it's perfect.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Highly recommended,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Impressed!!,2011-02-10,"Pros:Beautiful, Bright, Clear Display!!!! Bought 3 of these for my new eyefinity setup! Dig the 2ms response time. These monitors are very bright and vivid. Took my eyes a while to adjust lol.",Cons:None! Ask me in 6 months.,Other Thoughts:I have read people experienced problems w/t ghosting. This has not been an issue for me. All 3 montiors run beautiful!!!! First monitors I bought from ASUS. Very impressive. Normally I have been a die hard Samsung fan. Lets see how long they last. 5 eggs!,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Perfect,2011-02-10,"Pros:No dead pixels.Great warranty.Well just read the specs.And as for the warranty sticker people mentioned if you take care when un-boxing new equipment,the sticker stays where it should and doesn't just rip off with the protective film.Stand is sturdy,nice thin bezel around screen(sexy).",Cons:None its a display...and is awesome.,"Other Thoughts:Its a monitor people its not going to do special trick using your mind power.Controls are basic and more than adequate for making adjustments.Yes the presets aren't optimized and the stand doesn't tilt swivel etc.But it says so in the description.You get what you pay for with this monitor.Its a great deal on a great monitor its not going to do things that top end ones will.Thats why you are not paying top dollar.Be happy,you can find flaws in everything.Unless you received a damaged product stop giving poor reviews.And no i'm not a fan boy but it doesn't help anyone who is looking to buy something and all they see is bad reviews by people who don't understand what they ordered.",6,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Asus dropped the ball on this one,2011-02-10,"Pros:No dead pixels, brilliant, sharp colors.  Black shading was exceptional.","Cons:Monitor has major issues with ""motion blur/ghosting""I tested it on 2 PC's one with ""Asus 5850"" & ""GTX 470"", results were the same.  I could see major ghosting trails especially off of lettering on browser as well as pictures.  It was evident in gaming as well.I tried adjusting settings & tried both HDMI/DVI cable/inputs with same results.  Asus offered no help.Thank goodness for NewEgg taking good care of me as always.  There is no better company to deal with on returns.","Other Thoughts:I own or have owned numerous Asus monitors and this is the first time I've been disappointed.  I'd researched this monitor and knew that some people were experiencing the same issue, but I felt I would be an exception since Asus had never let me down before.This monitor had everything I wanted, but the ghosting was something I couldn't work around. If problem was minor I could have lived with it, but it was severe.I have never left a bad review on anything here on Newegg, but the ghosting issue is totally unacceptable.I've been buying monitors since the 1980's and have never seen a better example of lack of quality control from Asus.They should have never let this monitor leave their factory.If you buy this monitor just remember you are ""rolling the dice"", you may be lucky and get one without issues, but don't be surprised when you see ghosting.I highly recommend you do a Google search for a ""ghosting"" test to insure your monitor is ok.  Good luck!",13,3
ASUS,VE248H,5,Perfection!,2011-02-10,"Pros:I ordered this to replace a 22"" Samsung LCD unit that was still working fine, I just wanted a better picture and less wattage used.  The ASUS doesn't disappoint at all.  No dead pixels and everythign works great.  The HDMI input is really a killer addition cause for 2 weeks I used this as a TV for my daughter in her room using Direct TV and the picture was awesome!",Cons:No cons!,"Other Thoughts:Although everythign is perfect, I have noticed very very minor ghosting with clouds in games, but thats me being very picky and observing...my wife cant tell at all.  The other 'thought' is the colors on this are marginally better than my 3 year old 22"" LCD from Samsung.  Some colors are brighter while others are near the same...but I'm also producing these colors at probably half the wattage of that LCD too!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Pleased,2011-02-10,Pros:This monitor is amazing.  Crystal clear picture with bright levels spread evenly across the screen.  Displays HD videos without a hitch.  Menus easy to navigate once you get the buttons figured out.  Buttons themselves are low profile under the monitor and the blue power light doesn't shine in your face when the monitor is on.  May seem minor but I love the fact there are only three stickers on the edge of this thing.  Time from unpacking to fully functional 1920x1080 display set the way I like ~5 minutes.,Cons:Stand seems solid when you attach it but when supporting the monitor it can wobble a bit.  Speakers are terrible but I knew that going in.  No HDMI cable but again I knew that going in.  For price/performance these are minor annoyances that imo don't warrant an egg loss.,"Other Thoughts:At this price the performance is outstanding.  Shipping was fast fast fast!  Received in 2 days!  Product was packaged well, worked out of the box, and no dead pixels.  This is why I do business with the Egg.  Keep up the good work.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,A+++,2011-02-09,"Pros:Got this at a great price thanks to Newegg, plus free shipping!Overall quality and picture display are phenomenal.  It is vibrant, lightweight, and responsive.This is a must for gamers or power users.",Cons:I have none.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"You don't always get what you pay for, With this, I got MORE!!!",2011-02-09,"Pros:No dead pixels, Vivid image quality, Large Screen. For the price I paid, you can't beat the quality. Stand is better than most in this price range as well.",Cons:I only ordered one... Controls are more complex than some.,"Other Thoughts:This, like any of these type displays, will at times show slight ""ghosting"". Not enough to distract, but if you look close enough you can find it on ALL LCD's when it comes to fast moving objects. Most people never notice it, some monitors do a better job hiding it, yet, it is the nature of this type of display. Also, if you let the monitor warm up, it usually gets better. Also, with ""Dead"" or ""Stuck"" pixels, if you allow the monitor to run for a while, usually 24hrs, they can sometimes fix themselves. Not always, but from my experience about 70% of the time.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-02-09,"Pros:Brilliant picture. Blu-Rays look stunning. Upgraded from a 22"" Acer LCD. Just 2 more inches, but it makes a huge difference.",Cons:none. controls are intuitive. does what it is supposed to.,Other Thoughts:I'm in CT. It literally took two days for this to be on my doorstep with free shipping. AMAZING.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,1 dead pixel,2011-02-08,Pros:It would be a dream if not for the only con.,"Cons:1 dead pixel, left of center. Since there are less than eight, there aren't enough to send it back according to Newegg's Return Policy and it's placed just annoying enough to grab my attention.",Other Thoughts:Wish there was something I could do. Ran all the tests to make sure it wasn't just stuck. Sad day.,0,4
ASUS,VE248H,5,Beautiful Monitor,2011-02-08,Pros:The minute I plugged this in I was in WOW mode for like 30 minutes. This blows any other monitor I have owned (all from neweg) out ofthe water. If your looking for a good size and crisp picture this is so for your. Im upset I didnt get 2 or 3 of them and by the time I do they will probably nopt be avalable.,Cons:Didn't come with HDMI,Other Thoughts:This is (in my opinion) the best looking monitor I have seen in a while. Doesn't top 3D setups but the picture is vivid and crisp and games with HDMI on max settings and res. look beautiful...Tearfully beautiful..You will never see your games the same way if you have not seen this monitor,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Dead On Arrival,2011-02-08,Pros:I was not able to evaluate the monitor long enough to tell. The tilt mechanism seems to be of higher quality than my 4 year old 19'' Acer.,"Cons:It came DOA. I unpacked it, hooked it up, and all I can get with any of the inputs is a blinking pure white to pure black screen that cycles every few seconds for about 15 seconds and then it goes on standby.","Other Thoughts:Box arrived undamaged from UPS. Called Asus support and spoke to a real person right away which was nice. After a couple quick tests, they confirmed the monitor was definitely faulty and I should RMA it. Newegg sent out a pre-paid shipping label immediately and I dropped it in the mail. I'll leave another review after I get the replacement.",2,3
ASUS,VE248H,5,All I can say WOW,2011-02-08,Pros:Easy to setup.,Cons:Factory settings off a little but easy to fix if your a movie nut like me. Other then that none.,"Other Thoughts:This is my second 24"" Asus One for playing one for watching movies.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Nice!,2011-02-08,"Pros:Truly bright, vivid picture; no dead pixels; easy to install.  I was using a sturdy but not HDCP-capable 5 yr old Sony 17"" monitor.  This is sort of like going from regular screen to IMAX for me.  Also managed to gain real estate on my desk",Cons:expect it to shake if on an unsteady desk or surface,Other Thoughts:Arrived in literally less than one day.  I know I live near a warehouse but still...nice!,3,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Buy,2011-02-08,Pros:Beautiful Picture. No dead/stuck pixels. Great Price.,"Cons:Stands are a little wobbly, not a problem if you have a sturdy desk or if your going to wall mount like me.","Other Thoughts:Bought 3 to replace my HP w2408 and 19"" LG on my 1 pc. I've had them for less then a week but I absolutely love them.Free 3 day shipping means next day by 10am for me... Love you Newegg!!!!!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent HD LED,2011-02-08,"Pros:Crisp color, reasonable refresh rate, nice look, light, good overall specs.","Cons:Sound quality is decent for a 24"" monitor, which means it does not compare to any medium to nice sound system.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Nice,2011-02-07,"Pros:Consistent, bright picture. Relatively light and thin unit. Built-in speakers. Comes with DVI cable.",Cons:Not as light or thin as some other OLED monitors.,"Other Thoughts:The sound is pretty wimpy, but its hard to do better in a unit so compact and inexpensive.  Overall this thing is easily worth every penny.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very Pleased So Far,2011-02-07,Pros:*Amazingly bright*Great refresh rate and response time for gaming*Very sleek design*Fantastic clarity,Cons:*Very slight con but I think they could have made the stand feel more stable when adjusting the tilt of the monitor. Once again this is a minor quibble.*The bezel around the monitor is quite glossy so try to keep your fingers away from it unless you plan on cleaning it often.,"Other Thoughts:I purchased the computer a little over a week ago at Tiger Direct and have not had any issues as of yet. As soon as it was out of the box and I turned it on I was amazed by how bright it was. It can literally light a small room on its own if you turn off the lights. After testing out photo quality at max resolution I moved on to trying WoW on it as well as Crysis. Both looked stunning, especially when compared to my 2 year old samsung monitor.Neutral:*So long as your not expecting the speakers to be amazing on this monitor, you will not be disappointed. The sound produced is comparable to a mid-range Sony Ipod dock.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,WOWwww,2011-02-07,"Pros:Everything! my first LCD wide monitor. Light years ahead of what I had. Went with the Full HD for twice what I wanted to spend. But after reading these reviews, I was convinced to spend a little more to avoid disappointment! Thanks Newegg reviewers for making my purchase an informed one!",Cons:The only CON is that I didn't get a larger monitor yeeeears ago!,"Other Thoughts:If your new at this like I am - after windows loads, make sure to change your monitor settings to 1920X1080 (or whatever size monitor you buy) to get the full use of your pixels (or whatever). You may have to change some advanced display settings to get your type to be larger & readable. I had to do a bit of changing settings, and restarting and changing settings etc..., to get where I like it.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"Great monitor, bright and clear",2011-02-07,"Pros:This monitor replaces my workhorse Acer 22"". In comparison, at first I was a bit underwhelmed by the size as it seems to be the same height but just a bit wider. However the improved clarity and brightness from the LED backlighting is phenomenal. Its a completely different experience, not to mention the upgrade to 1080p. This monitor was a wise investment, and a reasonable price for the upgrade. Stand is sturdy and reliable, unlike most LCD's.","Cons:I might have to tone down the brightness? Actually its to my benefit as my new office is facing a large window. Lots of white glare in the Colorado winters! No problem seeing what's onscreen though. :)It could have come with an HDMI cable, but that's ok. Other features I would have liked but knew were not included are display port for eyefinity, tv tuner and height adjust. For the price, I realize that those were not included for cost reasons.It seems to have one very minor issue, on first boot it doesn't come out of power save mode and I typically have to reboot to get it going. This may be due to my using the VGA output to my KVM switch. Going to try a HDMI when I find my dongle. (moving is a major bummer)","Other Thoughts:I am un-interested in the speakers, I haven't even bothered to plug them in yet.If you are looking for a size upgrade from a 22inch you may be disappointed, better to hold out for a 26 inch or larger.My first Asus monitor, I am impressed!At less than 200 bones, I can easily recommend this.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Asus VE247H,2011-02-07,"Pros:Huge monitor.  Nice upgrade from my old 19"".  Easy to setup and install.  No dead pixels.  Extremely bright and the colors were crisp and clear.",Cons:Stand does not vertically adjust.  Not that big of an issue.,Other Thoughts:Great value for the price.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good monitor for the price,2011-02-07,Pros:over all this is a great monitor i use it as a 2nd monitor also have my xbox 360 and directv hddvr connected to it for a little gaming or tv while working. picture is great lcd with led backlight works and looks great on games as well as movies in full 1080p hd,Cons:no real complaints other than the onboard speakers are really bad for sound unless your using it just for everyday computer sounds i dont recommend using them at all,Other Thoughts:over all asus hit it out of the park with this monitor i cant complain ive had it about 3 months no problems or dead pixels,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Great Moniter, Stuck pixel =/",2011-02-07,"Pros:Great Moniter, freaking incredible, amazing contrast ratio, and a huge deskspace","Cons:There's a stuck pixel, which blows cause I don't really feel like sending it back, but I will eventually. Cause it's not really enough to make me want to get a replacement immediately, but its still kindof annoying",,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Well worth the $,2011-02-07,"Pros:In a word, everything.  I have no problems with mine like others I've seen on here (dead pixels/screen blacking out).  The colors look amazing and it seems huge next to my 23"" Samsung.  Easy set up with no notable problems.","Cons:For me none, but the monitor can only tilt a few degrees, so depending on your setup/needs this could be an issue.","Other Thoughts:From reading all the reviews on here, I was worried about having dead pixels or the screen blanking out, but neither of those happened for me, maybe I'm lucky.  Also from what I have heard on here I was expecting the speakers to be terrible.  People on here make them out to be bad when honestly for built in speakers, I was impressed(though maybe partially because I was expecting the worst). In my opinion, for built in monitor speakers, they are far from bad.  If you are looking for a good sized monitor and don't want to pay a fortune, buy it.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Good price for LED,2011-02-06,"Pros:Bright, adjustable base, easy to use -- I haven't noticed any problems reading text or playing video.",Cons:Form factor not any slimmer than regular LCD screen -- yet still more expensive.,"Other Thoughts:Other than lower power consumption, I don't get the ""big deal"" about LED flat-panel monitors, regular LCD seem to be just as good only cheaper.  I guess LED are supposed to last longer?",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Exactly what was expected,2011-02-05,Pros:- Great picture quality- No dead pixels- Sleek design,Cons:- none,"Other Thoughts:Company is great, monitor is great, and all at a good price; whats not to love.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,its delicious,2011-02-05,Pros:beautiful crisp and bright... speakers are decent enough for light use. ASUS is king period... love my Rampage III board!!,"Cons:design asthetics are clean, but ASUS could step it up a bit, and make it seem a little more luxurious... kind of plain jane on that front. still getting full 5 oevoes.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Gigantic,2011-02-04,"Pros:What else can be said? It's huge, it's sleek, it's relatively cheap. Arrived sturdy and set in its package. Been using it for 6-8 hours a day for a few days now and have not seen any of the flickering screen issues, or any problems at all. Color settings out of the box are mostly okay, just needed to adjust the brightness really. Haven't tried (or need) the PiP but it's a cool feature to have. Also haven't used the speakers but I'm going to assume most wont use them anyway, but it's always nice to have just in case.","Cons:The stand is set up against the monitor naturally when you take it out of the box, and it does take quite a bit of force to get it situated, enough to make you feel like it might not be the correct way to go about it. The manual does basically say (show) that you need to bend it but it honestly feels like you're going to break it. Also not really a con, but the brightness was set way too high for my tastes on all the different presets. Easy fix and like I said, not really a big deal.","Other Thoughts:It's unfortunate that some are having problems with the screen flickering and other issues, because this is an excellent monitor. Judging from the later reviews on Newegg and other sites, it looks like any problems they might have had with that batch are fixed (hopefully!)",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Beware,2011-02-04,Pros:Beautiful picture when it works. I originally gave this high marks on another review.,"Cons:I bought 2 of these for 2 computers. Both of them have had issues. First one started blinking light and dark repeatedly after about a weeks use and the frequency kept getting more often. That one is in for RMA.THe other one I bought also after about a week, started going completely black during a game of COD or while watching Netflix movies. It would go black for 3-5 seconds then come back on. It is also happening more frequently now. Looks like it will have to be RMA'd too.",Other Thoughts:It was great while it lasted. I have one in for replacement. Not sure if I want to replace the other one or just get something new. I would say there are issues with this model.,2,5
ASUS,VE248H,5,Wow Amazing,2011-02-04,"Pros:Perfect Size, not too big not too small, No dead pixel, Sturdy, sharp, soft corners, everything","Cons:None, if anything it feels kind of loose attached",Other Thoughts:Best monitor for its price. Compare to monitors $300+!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,very nice,2011-02-04,"Pros:Small, compact frame compared to the viewing area. Decent color. No dead pixels. Good price.",Cons:Speakers are poor. Didnt come with an HDMI cable.,"Other Thoughts:Bought this for my living room. Needed the smallest 1080p moniter I could find. This monitor is perfect so far. I have it mounted on a swing arm by the couch, so I can game in the living room.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Quality Montior,2011-02-03,"Pros:Bright, crisp, clear. This monitor was a addition to my existing 22 inch LG. This LED backlight monitor makes whites seem brown on my LG. Great price and great quality",Cons:None,,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,"IMO, Asus delivers a killer monitor at a killer price",2011-02-02,"Pros:My eyeballs have not stopped popping for the last 48 hours!- The resolution increase from my old 19"" 1280x1024 screen to this is much more impressive and useful than I thought it would be, and the amazing increase in brightness and sharpness compared to my old LCD has me drooling non-stop.- Not a single dead pixel. None. Nada. Zero.- 21.5"" on the nose - my tape measuring skills are not legendary by any means, but I'm pretty sure I know what the big mark between 21 and 22 means.- Thin! Not laptop-thin, but come on, it has stereo speakers- It weighs ~1/3 of what my old monitor does.- Buttons underneath the screen = clean front bezel, sexy monitor (minus the annoying blue sticker that tells me how energy efficient I am being but using this screen).","Cons:- The stand is not exactly bullet-proof and the screen wobbles a little if I'm pounding on my keyboard (I'm on an Ikea desk, gimme a break).- I could really stand for a little more height adjustment built-into the stand, but beggars can't be choosers. I'm happy ASUS chose to skimp on the stand, and not the screen, to save money.- ASUS also skipped out on providing an HDMI cable, but I'll give them a pass since cables cost all of four bucks.- Gloss black is a fingerprint/dust magnet.- Glowing power button (but at least it's pointed down).- You'll want two of 'em.","Other Thoughts:I haven't even turned on my 27"" 720p HDTV (also from Newegg) since I got this monitor, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to take the HDMI cable out of my TV and plug it into this so I can watch my Blu-Ray movies in all their glory.Let's pray everything stays peachy well past the warranty.Laptop + this monitor is like having 3 screens to work with.If you play UI intensive games, like an MMO, the extra real-estate on a 1080p screen vs. 720p is completely worth the frame-rate hit (225% more pixels to push, right?) but if you FPS, remember your video card will be working harder.",15,1

Have a neighbour watch your house the day you expect it if you can't be there to receive it yourself.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Better than expected...,2011-02-02,"Pros:- Looks great.- The color looks much more natural than the LG (LG E2360V) that I returned in order to get this model.  However, the Asus is much thicker and heavier but to me the picture looks better.- Warranty is excellent",Cons:- Not as thin as other models- Not as light as other models,Other Thoughts:I am very pleased with my purchase.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,great deal,2011-02-02,"Pros:Features for the price. I got it with a $20 instant rebate and $10 mail in rebate. My friend ordered one for work since he liked mine so much. Took his mail in rebate also. Had to calibrate the gamma a little but the brightness and contrast were set well straight out the box. Nice upgrade from a 19"" dell 4:3 lcd monitor.",Cons:The first one I ordered had a dead pixel. Newegg was very helpful and quickly replaced it at no cost to me and it did not keep me from getting my mir. 10 bucks is 10 bucks.,"Other Thoughts:I like how it has dvi, vga and hdmi ports. I always like asus mobos, their monitors are pretty nice too.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Paid for Nothing,2011-02-01,"Pros:Well i have no idea. I paid for a monitor, was told i had paid for the monitor. The following day i was out 230$ and informed that i had bought something they don't have. How nice for me to spend money on something that's not there. Also i now have to wait for them to return the money to my credit card and according to Newegg it's going to be a few day's. I have never had a problem with Newegg until today, now i'm just upset. A little warning about the monitor not being in stock would be have been nice, so now i have to wait and it's going to be another week till i can use my gaming PC.",Cons:NEWEGG service   DO  NOT ORDER AFTER HOURS!!!!!!Newegg has no idea what's in there Store. But they will take you MONEY!!!!!!!!!,Other Thoughts:Like i said i have never had such an issue new egg service is Fast and Cheap but i can't trust there service anymore. Especially when it matter's.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Noice,2011-02-01,"Pros:Its fat. Its sassy. Its large and in charge! Great colors and resolution switching from a 22'' 720p LED monitor. This thing is bright and vivid in a full 1080p resolution. Movies, games and everything else show up great on this screen. Asus fanboy made here.","Cons:UPS, UPS, UPS. They do those stealth knocks and then run, you know what im talking about. Shipping was the only prob for me. Keep her clean, possible dust magnet if you live in the ghetto.","Other Thoughts:Worked great out of the box, guess im one of the lucky ones. Leaving on for a 2 day straight test to see how it holds up with the blinking screen propaganda iv been seeing around the forums. Well worth the money.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"A very good monitor - and yes, I use IPS panels, too",2011-02-01,"Pros:Discussions about monitors usually devolve into petty arguments about IPS vs. TN panels, so let me state at the outset that I own a new 30"" and two new 22"" IPS monitors, and that this has not dampened my opinion of this very good monitor.For further reference, I also used to own three Asus 25.5"" TNs. Those were decent, but suffered from a blue tinge and weak brightness. They also just paled in comparison with IPS when you put them side by side.This monitor has none of those flaws. It has a very high usable brightness level, solid blacks, and no tinge. Backlight bleeding is very minimal at the top and bottom - less than my old Asus LCDs certainly no worse than IPS glow. The custom presets are very nice and most of them let you adjust color temperature and RGB values. SRGB mode doesn't let you adjust brightness, though, so it is very dim compared to other settings.Obviously, it shows the color shift that is inherent to TN panels, but this isn't for photography or web design.","Cons:One inevitable flaw of this monitor is the level of detail. Because 1920x1080 pixels are being overlaid on a very large (for a monitor) 27"" screen, you won't get the detail of a 24"" or 22"" monitor with the same resolution, or the detail of a 27"" or 30"" monitor with ~2500x1600 resolution. This is most obvious when you are looking at text but less obvious in games, assuming you can crank the AA levels.","Other Thoughts:I run this monitor as part of an Eyefinity group (22""+27""+22""), with this center being deliberately larger because I like it better than identically sized monitors for landscape mode. I run the 30"" below that for non-Eyefinity games. Very satisfied with this monitor.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2011-01-31,"Pros:Excellent monitor. No ghosting, didn't notice any bleeding of backlight.","Cons:The settings buttons might take some getting used to, but thats always been true for monitors.",Other Thoughts:Can become extremely bright.,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,4,Nice Screen But dead Pixel,2011-01-31,"Pros:Amazing contrast, size, price, and clarity.",Cons:Had a dead pixel out of box. kind of upsetting to have to rma.,Other Thoughts:Newegg will even pay to ship the RMA for free just have to ask. Bought from Newegg for many years. I am continually impressed by service.,3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,So Far So Good,2011-01-31,Pros:As a technician I have owned dozens of monitors mostly the gateway fp series. I was looking for a little more desktop space and the ability to run an xbox and this has more than fullfilled my expectations. No dead pixels and if you run color utility you can get rid of backlight bleed immediately. I would highly recommend this monitor too anyone looking for a large screen and not wanting to break the bank.,"Cons:The stand was a little weak but mounted to wall so no egg drop there. Speakers are a little weak but what do you expect on a 27"" for less than 400 bucks.",Other Thoughts:If you work on computers or you run an xbox on the side the multiple inputs and built in speakers will serve you well.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,DOA Monitor,2011-01-30,Pros:Don't know.  It was DOA,Cons:Dead on Arrival.  Now have to spend $20 to return on my nickel for RMA,,4,14
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good Picture.,2011-01-30,Pros:-Almost no backlight bleed.-No dead or stuck pixels.-Viewing angles are good.-Color is excellent..-Its bright...even though its 300cd/2-Its thin.,Cons:-1920 x 1080. Really? in 2011 that resolution?Color seems a bit dull..kinda washed out..,"Other Thoughts:Coming from the 24"" Asus MK241H 2ms 1920 x 1200 feels like a downgrade...Im going back to that monitor..450cd/2 really makes colors more vivid.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great!,2011-01-29,"Pros:Great display.  Very thin, light, great contrast.One of the nicest displays I've ever used.",Cons:Speakers are a bit quiet but for monitor speakers they're pretty good.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,DOA or Bad --8.5% of reviews,2011-01-29,Pros:None,"Cons:Think twice.My monitor arrived DOA.  Tested on 3 Machines using 2 different inputs. There was no shipping damage.If you look at the number of monitors that arrived dead or mortally wounded relative to the number of reviews that is 7 out of 82...  8.5 %. t Granted this is not a fair evaluation as most happy customers will not write review...but   I haven't applied for an RMA yet but I am going to guess, judging from another reviewer's experience, it will cost me $25.  The monitor is no longer a deal.  I will get a refund, as the chances of getting another  bad one are not insignificant.",,6,8
ASUS,VE248H,5,Superb performance,2011-01-29,"Pros:Picture quality, great contrast ratio, all pixels working, great input options and also has built in speakers, Even has an extra headphone/speaker jack for output. Design is great as well","Cons:below average speakers, but most people won't care about this.","Other Thoughts:This is a great monitor with superb picture quality for the price. I'm a little picky about Image quality but have not found a reason to complain about this monitor at all. I also like the fact that there is not only vga+dvi input but hdmi as well. This will be great for maybe adding a cable box to use in my office space when I like to watch something.The white's on this monitor are a nice bright white color without washing out the edges of images. The blacks are also a really nice black color and not grayish. The fast response time gives a nice smooth affect.The design of this monitor is simple yet sleek so it looks great on my desk.I went from a 19""ws which I thought was big enough but the added screen size helps a lot, especially at higher resolutions so text is clearly readable and photo editing is a breeze.I mainly purchased for photo and video editing and so far this monitor has filled my needs without dissapointment",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Awful Stay Away and Read All the Reviews,2011-01-28,"Pros:See my earlier review, post:Awful Stay Away and Read All the ReviewsAlthough very little in the way of positive.","Cons:This is my second post/review - see the other under title: ""Awful Stay Away and Read All the Reviews""I had to RMA the monitor , and was told it would cross ship, weeks in to the exchange I called Asus, and they said you do did not follow the correct procedure, we are repairing yours (versus cross shipping me another), you shouldn't have shipped us yours without getting ours first, and you didn't give us credit card info. I of course would have, but their rep gave me the wrong info. I said well you have my monitor can I give you a credit card now, and cross ship, but no, so weeks without a monitor. Get it back and still flickers on off, doesn't shut off completely but still. Called Asus back they said they would cross ship (and this was tier 3 issue being a second RMA request), should be 48 hours and I would receive an e-mail with tracking, a week or more later just got off the phone with them, and they don't know when they will ship me another.","Other Thoughts:I contacted Newegg originally about the issue, and they said they would send an email on my behalf, but they couldn't help any further. So I have had a faulty monitor from the beginning, but I didn't hook it up immediately so was beyond the 30 day return period, but I have a lemon, and no one is willing or able to help...Make sure if you do want to try this monitor, that you hook it up immediately, leave it on and seriously look for faults so you don't have to go through what I am.",6,7
ASUS,VE248H,3,"decent monitor, horrible speakers",2011-01-27,"Pros:Cheap, HUGE, hdmi, speakers. all the works pretty mucheasy to build... menu/buttons are hard to understand at first, but once u get it its quite obviousit wide enough to fit firefox and microsoft word next to each other without the need to minimize either one. so when i do my essays or just want to multitask, u dont hav to use a second screen for an extension (even tho i still do)","Cons:SPEAKERS, dont even bother with them. theyre too quiet and not clear at allthe start up time is long enough for me to grow me beard, first it takes awhile to turn on.... then it shows the ASUS logo for a few seconds then completely starts up... which can get annoying especially when u want to just check an email real quick.","Other Thoughts:i dont think its the monitos fault, but i cant really watch movies full screen without it becoming really blurry/pixelated. but its most likely my GPU",0,4
ASUS,VE248H,5,very nice monitor,2011-01-27,"Pros:Nice size monitor for 1920x1080. Excellent contrast, brightness and size for a desktop monitor. Love it...Great service as always with newegg.",Cons:none.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,DO NOT BUY ASUS,2011-01-27,Pros:good picture,Cons:Disconnects HDMI input after a variable amt. of time.  I returned the unit for repair - they shipped it back still bad after a full 30 days. I now have been messing with ASUS for over 6 weeks with NO RESOLUTION.  They deny knowing about this issue even though I have found it on multiple posts elsewhere. I never should have bought this unit.,Other Thoughts:Asus now wants ANOTHER 270.00 for a cross-shipment for a refurb.  They charged my card 3 days ago - so far NO SHIPMENT FROM THEM.  I used to respect Asus. Now I recommend NEVER purchasing from them.,8,10
ASUS,VE248H,5,BIG LED without the BIG COST!,2011-01-27,"Pros:The LED really brings out the whites as well as the dark blacks. Huge price difference once you go to 27"" with competitors. connections: DISPLAY PORT, thank you asus! HDMI is nice as well to have a gaimg console. speakers are not much to write home about, but they are there.","Cons:I would have liked to seen a higher resoloution for this monitor, but I guess you get what you pay for. The base has not been an issue for myself, however I can see how it could be for some. I do have an issue when say I have my computer up on display port and my 360 on the hdmi, whenever I switch from the inputs it resets the xbox! very annoying when need to check you email and you've just been booted from your cod match...","Other Thoughts:I spent alot of time researching these monitors and almost bought the ve276q before this one came out. I am very glad I waited! I have this running on the sapphire 6870 w/ i7 930 @ 4Mhz... battlefield looks amazing! get your dusters out though, this thing loves fringprints and dust!",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Beautiful Display After Calibrating,2011-01-27,"Pros:Bright LED, no dead pixels, great price with MIR and Promo Code.  Stand is fine especially for a monitor in this price range.  I've seen much worse on monitors costing more.  No noticeable ghosting in games.  Couldn't be happier after calibrating.  Ordered it in the morning and received the next day w/ standard shipping, of course I'm in PA bordering NJ and the warehouse was in NJ so that's a bonus.","Cons:glossy black is a dust magnet, but I can't knock off a star for that.","Other Thoughts:At first it looked a little washed out.  I lowered the contrast and brightness down to the 45 range, but then the whites weren't white anymore.  I just couldn't get colors to look rich,  while keeping whites from turning grey.  I adjusted the gamma down a bit on my video card's controls and it looked much better, colors were much more saturated and not washed out and whites where white as I could raise the contrast and brightness.  I still thought it could look better so I found this free program called Monitor Calibration Wizard 1.0 and after calibrating it, the display showed it's true colors.  Just google for it if you want to give it a try since hyperlinks are forbidden.  It helps to squint your eyes when using this program making it easier to see where to adjust the sliders.  Prior to calibrating I noticed some ghosting of letters/numbers while scrolling up/down with black text on white backround, after calibration it went away.",20,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2011-01-26,"Pros:Crisp, clear and a good size. Used HDMI for excellent picture.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Speakers are wimpy but not expected to be very good. Stand is ok, not in California so I don't have to worry about earthquakes.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Near Perfection,2011-01-26,"Pros:* Beautiful Picture with a very large color window* Little to no ghosting (Very little over VGA, none over HDMI)* HDMI-Audio to Stereo/Headphone pass-through works great* Easy to use OSD* No dead pixels* No issues after 3 months of use","Cons:* Built-in speakers are not that great (although, I'm not sure why you'd buy a monitor for it's speakers ...)* I'm pretty sure that at the time I purchased it, the description said something about a cake if I bought this, and I still haven't received that yet.","Other Thoughts:I use this monitor for two purposes right now ...First, it's become my primary display off of my laptop while I'm at my desk. It's connected this way over VGA, and I've had no issues with it so far.Second, it's my gaming display for my Xbox 360. I run HDMI straight into the display, plug a 2.1 speaker system or headphones into the audio-out jack, and I'm good to go.I plan on building a desktop in a couple of months, and I'm heavily considering on buying a second one for it. That way, I can run HDMI to the second for my main display, and DVI to this for an extended desktop when I'm not using my Xbox.Overall, I highly recommend this display to anyone whose preferences are 1080p, HDMI, LED-backlighting, fast response time, and a reasonable price tag.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing,2011-01-26,Pros:Amazing packing. 1 day shipping for Free. Whats not to love. Colors are flawless,Cons:None so far waiting to start my new build to take full advantage of the resolution,Other Thoughts:I was a little surprised to see the monitor shipped without any extra packaging but the box was dent free.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Happily my 2nd Asus monitor!,2011-01-25,"Pros:This was purchased for a Christmas Wish build for an underpriveledged child. Color and clarity are excellent and the HDMI is incredible! Great performance for a budget price. Lightweight, portable and low on energy consumption. What's not to like? As a computer monitor it's superior and for video playback it's even better giving you excellent detail and great color rendering without any bleeding. I would have to say it's even better than my $400 LG monitor with similar features.",Cons:None at all!,Other Thoughts:Flat out this is a great monitor and well worth 1.5x's this price!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,The Best Buy,2011-01-25,Pros:HUGE. BRIGHT. FAST.From an unopened box to setup was less than two minutes. The mounting process for this monitor was an absolute breeze. The mounting feels very solid. This monitor is massive with large screen real estate. The pictures don't do it justice. And not one dead pixel.Shipping was amazingly quick despite horrible weather conditions. It arrived a day earlier than I expected too. Thanks Newegg!,Cons:It has yet to get my BLT sandwich order right.,"Other Thoughts:Without a doubt, one of the most solid buys I've done on Newegg. I would encourage anyone who's even contemplating a monitor purchase to snag this thing. Amazing value.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-01-25,"Pros:Absolutely glorious. Vivid colors, lighting fast (I can't notice any ghosting during fast actions scene in CoD:BO for PC). I have been eying this monitor for a several months, waiting for a price drop or sale and grabbed it on sale. It was arrived 2 days later and now I'm running a dual monitor setup between this monitor and my old 4:3 Dell LCD monitor. Flawless, tons of adjustments that can be made for what you need it to do and the built in profiles is a very nice touch. the 10,000,000:1 contrast ratio give beautiful blacks and whites. Didn't realize how lacking my old monitor was in contrast and brightness until I set this baby up next to it and had them display identical images and videos (then again, my old monitor is from 2003)","Cons:-Bit of a dust magnet - but my entire dorm building is very dusty, so that's not helping things. Not worth deducting an egg though.-Not so much a con (and not worth deducting an egg), but I would have preferred a second DVI port over the HDMI port, since I use external speakers and all HDMI essentially is is DVI with digital surround sound worked in. Don't use the monitors speakers, so I would rather have a second input for my Xbox or lap top.","Other Thoughts:To everyone complaining 'it gets dark when I'm viewing it from an angle', 'speakers suck', etc.The viewing angles are normal for monitors these days. I will admit that the optimal viewing angle is +45 and -45 degrees along the horizontal from perpendicular to the screen, and it is the same for the vertical - but all it does is darken a little (and everything is still perfectly visible). I suspect this has more to do with the LED back lighting. I'll happily trade smaller viewing angles for brighter whites, darker blacks and faster response times in a computer monitor.As for the Monitors speakers: they're, what? 2-5 watts? if you want good sound, buy a set of speakers. If you don't care about your computer's sound, then go ahead and use the built in ones.Everyone of my floor is jealous of this monitor, even my roommate who has an Asus MS238H is jealous of this beauty.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,very nice,2011-01-25,"Pros:good color, features, quality, price","Cons:menus are slow, need to press buttons multiple times to register.  this is annoying when switching inputs or volume.  volume control is not very good, as it requires like 3 clicks before it can be raised or lowered.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,You will need shades,2011-01-25,Pros:Bright,Cons:Bright. I've turned it all the way down and it's the brightest monitor in the place.,Other Thoughts:Does this run at a higher resolution than 1920x1080?,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Fits my needs,2011-01-24,"Pros:The picture on this monitor is superb. Preset settings look great, no need to tweak a ton. I am using this in multi monitor setup and it outshines my older 22"" Brand Name Monitor that also starts with an A.The monitor is a 23.6"", but it is actually 1/8"" shorter(screen side only) than my 22"", which makes the monitors fit quite nicely together, though the resolution difference messes things up.","Cons:There is very noticeable ghosting in games. I played this RC flight sim game and when the plane was moving fast, the ghosting is extremely noticeable. It seems to be most noticeable with fast moving objects with light solid/semisolid backgrounds. Also played BattleField 2 and it seemed alright except for a few moments when a helicopter flew overhead. Also noticed when looking around at buildings with the sky behind them. I do not play much, nor do I really care about the ghosting in the first place, but I am just stating the facts.When there is dark scenes, obvious bleeding from bottom.",Other Thoughts:I would really like this thing to be able to go portrait without special mounting stuff.I wasn't really expecting this to be so wide. Make sure you are ok with 16:9 ratio compared to typical monitors...It is definately useful for side to side work.Great value for this monitor though..don't expect the best.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Dead pixel high probability for you,2011-01-24,"Pros:Sturdy display, bright images, good price, great specs for gaming, etc.","Cons:Dead pixel(s), bought two Asus monitors and have dead pixels on both. Not enough to return mind you, just enough to warrant letting folks know that odds are.... dead pixels are in your future if you buy one of these.","Other Thoughts:I've purchased Asus motherboards and had reasonable success. The price and performance for these monitors is enough to make one seriously consider. However, I've purchased several Sony, Samsung, and other LCD monitors and never experienced a pixel problem. I got two Asus monitors with this order and both have dead pixels. If you can afford it my advise would be; spend the extra money and get a higher end product. If you are O.K. with decent performance and likely dead pixels go with this one. If I had it to take back, I'd get Samsung or other high-end.",1,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor for Price,2011-01-24,"Pros:This monitor is great for it's price, but was even better during the sale.It's full 1080p HDMI, but you're going to have to mess around with the stock settings to get a crisp monitor image.  I recommend downloading 'pixperan', which will allow you to modify your monitor settings easily because it provides you with many different tests.It's sound is slightly louder (not by much) than an iPhone at full volume if you'd like to compare, but you shouldn't buy this monitor for the speakers.  They are more of a 'bonus'.The stand is nice and round to hold the monitor up.  It is very stable, and doesn't move at all if a door shuts/I slam something on my desk.The monitor came with an abundance of cords, including two different monitor cables.I did not have any ghosting, dead pixels on arrival, but read 'Other thoughts' for more information.","Cons:Haven't seen any yet, though I've only used it for a day.","Other Thoughts:I'll change this review if I notice anything within the first few months.  Overall, I'm happy with the monitor.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,very good,2011-01-23,"Pros:Excellent quality, very bright.  This makes my old chimei monitor look like a dark closet with the light off..

ASUS,VE248H,1,DOA,2011-01-23,Pros:Very large screen and is surprisingly light for it's size.,Cons:The monitor doesn't display any picture.

ASUS,VE248H,3,Not bad but not all that good,2011-01-22,Pros:- Price is pretty competitive for LED display- on the fly input selection is handy- has a handful of customizable settings to fit user's needs. (Just not mine),"Cons:You can't really say much about a monitor if you don't like its picture. For this particular monitor I felt that the color was considerably washed out. I compared it to a $100, 17""  CCFL screen and I couldn't really believe it but the color on the 17"" just seemed to be much more vibrant and better looking. I tried everything I could to fix the color to my liking on this ASUS monitor but just could not get rid of the purple tint/washed out feel.","Other Thoughts:By my standards this monitor just isn't up to par. However, my standards are higher than average. Overall the color issue really isn't THAT bad but it certainly is noticeable, if you have any doubt that this monitor is good enough for you then I do NOT recommend it.",2,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Adequate,2011-01-22,"Pros:- Very decent picture once you fiddle with the settings- Very average bezel that matches well with other monitors- Low power use. Advertised as 35 W but only uses about 17 W on my preferred settings. Compare this to my smaller and dimmer Samsung CCFL backlit monitor using 40 W. Also stays completely cool.- Stand is easy to assemble and disassemble.- The power light turns a nice soft amber in standby, much less distracting in a dark room than a bright blinking LED.- No noise/buzzing/humming at all.","Cons:- A nontrivial presence of ghosting, which shows worst with a black object (like cursor or text) moving on a light grey background. Probably not much worse than other TN monitors.- Bleeding on all four sides noticeable on dark images. Can give colors a blue tint that doesn't look too good.- Speakers- ASCR doesn't appear to work. Dynamic contrast features are supposed to vary the amount of backlighting as the displayed image changes, but that doesn't happen on this monitor. Instead, the backlighting stays the same until the image is ~95% black, at which point the monitor turns off and you can't see the remaining 5% of the image. I contacted ASUS and they indicated this was a ""normal phenomena."" This makes the ASCR worse than useless, and the advertised 10,000,000:1 a pointless random number. I don't even want to use dynamic contrast because it tends to be annoying, it just bothers me that it doesn't work as advertised.","Other Thoughts:- The monitor does take longer than average to power up and to switch between different inputs.- The tilt is advertised as -5 to +20, but it actually tilts very far forward. Probably more like -25 to +20.- Viewing angles aren't great, but I literally never notice that unless I go out of my way to test it.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great buy for the price,2011-01-21,"Pros:Excellent resolution, great colors/contrast for the price. Good hookup options. Great value for the money.","Cons:Some ghosting visible on a bright background, but I don't notice it most of the time. Its a TN panel, so viewing angle is average. Speakers are so-so and not very loud, so don't expect to play much hi-def audio.","Other Thoughts:This is for general purpose home use (movies, web, picture editing and software development)I use a pair of Dell Ultrasharps at work, so I'm used to having adjustment/rotation and an excellent viewing angle. The Asus is not stellar in these respects (limited adjustment and TN), but for the price, its definitely 5 stars. I wish Asus had left off the speakers and provided a USB hub instead - that would have made it perfect.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazed,2011-01-20,Pros:-HUGE screen-Crisp colors-No bleeding-No dead pixels-Nice range of adjustments on the base,"Cons:-I don't have any, this thing is awesome.","Other Thoughts:First one I ordered came DOA, but this one fired right up. Props to newegg for the quick replacement.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Bad response time compensation,2011-01-20,Pros:-Very bright-Low power usage-Absolutely no ghosting for the first week.,"Cons:-After a week of owning it, it developed a very bad inverted ghosting problem; everything that moved left an inverted trail behind it.-One dead sub-pixel-Color reproduction and gamma were way off, but this is to be expected from a TN panel.-Buttons are in a very awkward spot and the menu was difficult to navigateIt looks like the response time compensation that they used to get the 2ms response time is way too aggressive. I'm not sure if it was just my panel or if this is a design flaw, but that level of artifacting is unacceptable.","Other Thoughts:I returned this after it developed the ghosting problem and got a Dell U2311H instead. Now this is a good display, I'm never going back to TN panels now.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Well worht it,2011-01-19,"Pros:I origionally bought this monitor to replace my 19 inch Hanns G LCD monitor. I was looking for a larger size but not obscenely huge (yet haha). The addition of having DVI, VGA, and HDMI ports on the backside with an easy ""mode switch"" button makes it great for using my computer or my 360 back and forth without having to plug and unplug cables.",Cons:Did not come with a winning lottery ticket.,,3,0

I love the different presets that can be switched between at the push of a button, even though mine tends to stay in theater mode.","Cons:In the weeks and months following my purchase of this monitor I saw not one, but several different offers for screens of this size or greater, also from Asus, on sale on newegg for less than what I had paid for it. It really put a damper on the thrill of finally replacing my monitor. I suppose I could have contacted newegg about the price different earlier, but it has been over a month since I purchased this one, so I'll just have to live with it.",,0,16
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-01-18,"Pros:Easy setup, just plugged everything in and was ready to go. Speakers worked fairly well considering what they are. The the video quality of this monitor is pretty outstanding, actually had to tune it down a few notches here and there. Also, not a dead pixel in sight! :D","Cons:Only thing I can really con on this is the menu, for someone lacking patience or any know-how for electronics it can be a bit of a headache, but a little reading or some background with manually setting up a TV or w/e is enough to figure it out.",,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2011-01-18,Pros:Has a great crisp screen and a very good contrast compared to my Samsung P2350 monitor. The speaker sound good enough for something of this price. Used it to hook up to a laptop and an Xbox 360 and worked almost perfectly. This monitor is great value for the amount you pay.,"Cons:A weird quirk which may not even affect most people. When I played ToV on the Xbox 360 via HDMI, I noticed that while the speakers worked very well but when I used the headphone jack with a pair of Sennheisers, there was very noticeable static noise during parts of the game where there was no ambient noise or BGM. Very weird and isolated situation but like I mentioned, it should not really affect anyone. I have not tested this with any other games as the rest of mine have ambient noises at all times.Not really a con but I can't figure out how to lower the brightness with the buttons on the monitor. Something my Samsung allowed.",Other Thoughts:I bought this back in mid-December when the rebate was there and the rebate was also a reason I chose this over the 21.6 inch model Asus offered since it would be only $5 with free shipping. Sadly my rebate form and the UPC bar code was returned to me from lack of forwarding address and my emails were not replied to for about 2 weeks now. It was $10 so I'm not going to fight over it but I'm also not going to consider Asus rebates as part of my price when I'm comparing brands in the future.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-01-18,"Pros:Clear picture, no dead pixles.","Cons:Sound, although it is built in and 1 watt speakers. I expected nothing great but the sound on my 4 year old HOP monitor was much better. often end up using headphones to watch movies due to it being quiet.

The monitor has presets some great, some ok. My preferences in brightness and contrast vary from one application to the next. so I find myself flipping through the presets when i play diff games.

ASUS,VE248H,5,So far so good,2011-01-16,"Pros:Well-packaged, no dead pixels out of the box. Great contrast ratio and size for this price point. I wanted to save on power consumption so LED was one of my considerations. It looks great so far, though I have no idea how much power I'm actually saving with the LED backlight vs. regular LCD. The monitor display pre-sets (theater, gaming, normal, night mode, scenery) and menus are pretty straightforward.",Cons:The glossy finish is like a giant highlighter for dust and fingerprints.

I live in Southern California (so near their CA distribution center), but still, that's awesome. Thanks NewEgg!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Absurd Contrast,2011-01-15,"Pros:I chose this monitor due to the LED backlighting and reasonable price, and it blew me away.  I couldn't believe the contrast ratio.

ASUS,VE248H,5,What an upgrade!,2011-01-14,"Pros:I want to start this review by stating that I upgraded from a 4:3 LCD monitor. The color differences from my old monitor to this one aren't even comparable. Everything looks amazing on this monitor. Games from my computer look incredible, and I love having my PS3 hooked up to the HDMI. Slim design is nice, and the Power button lights up so I can find it at night.","Cons:The other buttons are smaller and harder to find, but you only set up your monitor once so no big deal. Speakers aren't that amazing either, but that not why I bought the monitor",Other Thoughts:Worth an upgrade if you are coming from an older model LCD. The colors really pop off the screen and looks gorgeous in just about any environment.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Screen,2011-01-14,"Pros:Big, bright, no dead pixels, no backlight bleed. Everything you could want in a monitor. After a quick learning curve, I found the buttons easily operated with one hand and ergonomic.",Cons:My blu-ray collection is not big enough.,Other Thoughts:Found this on eggxpert after I returned a defective unit from another brand.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Works well, with ghosting",2011-01-13,"Pros:Good price (when I got it), good stand and mounting system, preset modes (you can have different customized profiles for day and night, movies or games - really helps to have a darker one for working on white documents and a lighter one for playing dark games)","Cons:Slow(er) start up time. Takes 7 seconds from power button push to image on screen. Not bad when you start up the computer, but significant when you like to turn the screen off often. Some ghosting of black text on white background (white trail following the text, caused by overshoot used to achieve 2 ms response time). Only noticeable when scrolling with a very smooth frame rate.",Other Thoughts:Happy with the screen.

Came with power cable, DVI and AVG.  Newegg and Asus both exceeded my expectations.",Cons:When the monitor first shipped it arrived minus working LED backlighting. I was upset but it wasn't an immediate concern. I shipped it back to Newegg (they paid shipping too!) and received my current working one with amazing turnaround time. Thanks Newegg!,"Other Thoughts:I did give it 5 eggs  but did have 2 very small issues of nitpicking. 1: It would have been nice if my 1st monitor worked, but since Newegg replaced it at no cost to me (ok, it cost $0.11 to print out a shipping label) I was completely happy; 2: It didn't come with an HDMI cable. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect one and didn't need one but it would have been nice. Again, this is absolute nitpicking. This is one GREAT monitor!",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2011-01-13,Pros:The image looks great. No ghosting while playing games. For the money this monitor has been awesome. No dead pixels either.

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-01-09,"Pros:Great color clarity, strong backlight, great refresh with no noticeable ghosting in games.","Cons:Backlight bleeds, mostly on the bottom; NOT noticeable unless screen is all black. Even with the bleed on a black screen, the blacks and whites this monitor produces are very clear and true. Text and games look great.There is ghosting, but only if you really try to get it to ghost in windows on white to black. I have NOT noticed this affect in games once.","Other Thoughts:Despite the minor drawbacks, this monitor is great. I gave it 5 stars because I got exactly what I expected from this monitor. No dead pixels. I upgraded from my old dell 2004 21"" because it made 150fps feel like 50fps, this monitor is quite an improvement from that. I read all of the reviews of monitors in the same class and this looked like the most solid monitor for around the $200 price range. Both the bleeding and white to black ghosting are negligible as they only appear in extreme circumstances. Unless you're planning on spending much more money to find that 'perfect monitor' without any drawbacks, I think this is one of the best buys for the money. All this of course is assuming you know how to adjust the brightness/color settings on both the monitor and video card, I notice many people writing LCD reviews have dumb issues like that...

ASUS,VE248H,1,STAY AWAY,2011-01-07,Pros:The screen is big and the quality is decent,"Cons:The ghosting issue really needs to be addressed by ASUS. With a 2ms response time there should not be any ghosting what so ever, however this doesn't seem to be true as ghosting is a really obvious problem.Also I don't really notice any improvement in blacks with the LED backlight.I can not recommend this monitor to anyone until this issue is fixed and I will try RMAing my monitor or seeing if there is any possibility of returning it.Very disappointed",,5,1

It's a black sticker on the bottom left edge, under the VGA connector.  The warranty is now ""void"", according to the sticker.  The warranty sticker was stuck to the plastic wrap and just came off when I pulled the wrap off.  If you buy one, unwrap the edges carefully, preferably before setting it up.  I'm not saying I'll need warranty service within two years, but if I do, it will be a serious issue.  Very little in the way of instructions on adjustments which take a few minutes to figure out.

I had to turn the brightness down to zero in order to adjust the color profile on my Mac.","Other Thoughts:We bought three of these based on the reviews in Newegg and after an hour or two, I can say we are otherwise pleased with them especially compared to the ancient junk 17-inch CRT monitors they replaced.  They're not the high end monitors, but without any fluorescent backlights I'm hoping they'll last us for a long time.

They play well with the powercolor minidp adaptors.","Cons:They are set up for a standard configuration, and if you want to use them for eyefinity there are a few things you should be aware of before you buy.1. Those nice power buttons will be a pain in you want to use these in a 3 way portrait eyefinity group because the power buttons will shut the monitors off if you bump any of the monitors, because the power button touches it's neighbor monitor.Also, again, if you use this on a portrait eyefinity group  the right hand monitor will have to be canted in a bit because the viewing angle will make it dimmer than the others if used in a flat aspect. Of you'll have to sit slightly right of center. Not noticeable in darker games, but in a bright windows environment you will notice it.","Other Thoughts:If you mount these on Lubic parts, 80/20 track, or a custom made channel  they will be a fixed distance apart, (But they must have a flat aspect.) and the power buttons won't give you any trouble. I don't think they will work in portrait mode stock because the stock stand doesn't swivel. I'm using the VESA mounts, and they work fine.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Buy,2011-01-06,"Pros:It's a Better monitor than the rest. No side to side color changes in viewing. Was gonna buy a Samsung - Glad i didn't.The base is very stable, doesn't wobble, very solid. Features are as advertised. Works great.",Cons:none..,Other Thoughts:ASUS is A+,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good monitor,2011-01-06,"Pros:- 24"" Wide Screen- .27 pixel- runs cool- excellent power button location & very soft blue glow- while gaming i'm hard pressed to tell the difference from my old Sony FW900 23"" CRT Trinitron wide screen",Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:When not gaming, I use alot of Desktop backgrounds that are dark or black (space photos, etc) and this monitor seems to have a lot of bleed-thru at the bottom of the screen - so much so that I decided to move my toolbar back to the bottom of the screen. Other than this, it appears to be an excellent monitor.",3,0

ASUS,VE248H,1,No Luck with this monitor,2011-01-06,Pros:Looks nice,"Cons:Monitor had tearing, ghosting of everything on screen, closed pages would still show faded out.

ASUS,VE248H,5,great monitor/great price,2011-01-05,Pros:I know I'm late but I finally made the move to a LCD monitor. Decided to go with LED and HDMI so I'll be somewhat up with technology. This product seems to be everything advertised and for a reasonable price.,Cons:One stuck pixel...haven't decided yet if I'll return or just deal with it.,"Other Thoughts:For the newegger who complained about the size...you should remeasure the screen size and your ""Tech Knowledge"". Anyone who knows anything about Monitors or TV's knows that screen size is measured diagonally.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Defective ?,2011-01-05,Pros:No dead pixels.  LED backlight should give good power consumption and a chance at longer life than old-style backlights.,"Cons:Does not auto-select inputs.  Plug in with VGA cable and it says ""HDMI - no signal"" untill we press the input-select button.The DVI input seems dead.  Have tried with the included DVI cable and a known-good one of ours.  Always says no signal.  (Our DVI cable and same computer work fine on a 1080p monitor of another brand.  Same comp works with VGA cable with either monitor.)  Have not tested the HDMI input.Menus are not as intuitive as on the LG E2340 / LG E2350 or NEC EA192M.Buttons are on the bottom, facing down, not the lower-front like I prefer.  At least it has real buttons, not the horrid touch-sensitive abominations on the LG E2350.","Other Thoughts:Inputs are on the back, facing down.  Might be ok if you want to put it against a wall, but I happen to hate that arrangement.Have not tested the speakers.Should have got another LG 2340.  Have several, no problems with any of them.Plan to try to RMA it tomorrow because of the DVI issue.",1,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,GHOSTING.,2011-01-05,Pros:- Colors are fantastic after minor changes in the monitor configuration menu; I really couldn't believe my eyes coming from a Westinghouse LCM-22w2.- Can't feel any heat rising up from the monitor vent at all.- Just the right size for 1920x1080 resolution.,"Cons:There *IS* ghosting with dark text and graphics on a light background, and EVERY one of these monitors does it.  I've tried three!  Go on Youtube and search for VE248H.  You'll see it.2ms response time is also not correct; playing Lineage 2, there is the exact same amount of ghosting as my old 5ms monitor.  I have my display cloned on both monitors at once and I couldn't tell a speck of difference when it came to characters or text staying crisp while they moved across the screens.Mine came with one bright red pixel near the middle, too.  Had to press on it hard in many different places to make it disappear for 24 hours, just for it to pop back up again.","Other Thoughts:This would be a perfect monitor if it wasn't for the ghosting.  Really unfortunate.  Also, the manual only states that the warranty is for 2 Years.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Awesome quality,2011-01-05,Pros:Thing looks great.  This is my first LED monitor.  I also own 2 ASUS VH236H monitors and its comparable if not better quality.  I got it setup with the other ones in eyefinity and it looks great.  Recommended.,Cons:Dead green pixel.  Never shows up unless under black background.  Its only one though.  A lil peeved but I know ASUS is quality.  One slipped by though.  My other ASUS monitors haven't had this problem.,"Other Thoughts:Speakers? Never used them.  Like people have said, they only come into play if you have a game system hooked up hdmi.  The quality isn't that bad but its better to just hook up external speakers to it.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Awesome,2011-01-05,"Pros:2ms response time, incredible. COD Black Ops never looked so clear. I am running with the HDMI inputs and I am pleasantly suprised. I can see things in game now like people thru windows of a car across the map, that I couldnt make out before. I think the price point vs size/specs of this monitor are perfectly matched if not skewed in favor of the specs. (which is good) I have tried gaming with 5ms monitors before and they just cant keep up in FPS play. I have no dead pixels and did not even try plugging in the speaker inputs as I use headphones anyways.",Cons:The only con I have about this monitor is the factory color presets that have been posted about before. They are awful. I am running on 'Theatre' preset right now but I see that I am going to have to calibrate even that.COD Black Ops: Lost about 25 FPS due to going from 1680 x 1050 res to 1900 x 1080. Obviously that is a graphics card issue and not related at all to the monitor. Just saying to be aware of that if you are upgrading.The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars was because of the weak factory presets. Not a big issue as you can calibrate but still noted.,"Other Thoughts:HDMI connection...I bought an HDMI cable with this monitor and thought I was going to go crazy when I tried to plug it into my EVGA GT465. It wouldnt fit. Thought it was a case interference issue at first, then I realized that the HD input on the video card was smaller than standard HDMI plug. After realizing that I needed a different cable (would have to wait for another order to ship) I remembered that I had an unopened baggie in my video card box. Sure enough, the video card came with the correct cable so I was in business. The HDMI interface on the monitor is the standard size.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,"Good, but not great",2011-01-05,Pros:No power brick. Standard VESA mounting holes. Asus was the only manufacturer without a power brick I could find. Rather made my decision for me. That they are inexpensive and fairly nice is a plus.Very bright (turned down brightness from 90 to 60 and they're still really two bright). Plan to spend some time fussing with the controls to eliminate killer-color-mode.,"Cons:Speakers are as bad or worse than other posters have said. I'll be picking up a pair of small desktop speakers.Found one dead pixel so far (red channel dead on the pixel). Nothing stuck-on I've seen. Haven't yet seen if I can revive it with one of the pixel-exercise patterns. Disappointing, but I bought two so the dead-pixel one will just be the non-primary display.","Other Thoughts:1920x1080 is a lot more ""widescreen"" than my old 1920x1200. I conceptually knew it but didn't realize how much different it'd be in person.Who cares how thin another manufacturer's screen may be when there's this giant fugly power brick attached to the monitor? No thanks, that should have been left to the 80s and laptops.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Very pleased,2011-01-05,"Pros:Well there are quite a few pros, at least IMO.-Huge-Whites are very vibrant and appear to me to be white I cant really see it learning towards blue like some LED displays do-Thinner then I expected its still not as thins as the ones with an external power supply but still nice and thin.-Very nice and high quality bezel and stand. Super glossy (almost a con)-24.0 inches not a 23.6 or something that is not really 24.-Light weight, it weighs like 8 or so pounds.-I thought it had easy to use menu controls.-My 360 looks great on it =)- Draws very little power.-Cheap price for the quality and no dead or stuck pixels and I've owned it for a little under a week.I could go on but don't feel like it =P",Cons:-Stock settings suck bad.-Bezel is almost too glossy see all your finger prints in it.-Stand is a little wobbly.-Even tho the whites look really bright and vibrant the blacks suffer they are more dark gray then anything even with the contrast smart control it doesn't really help.,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from a 6 year old 19"" 400:1 contrast ratio Westinghouse.Didn't try the sound so couldn't tell you.The warranty sticker problem was resolved on mine, the shipping film goes around it as opposed to on it or even under it.I had a bit of a warranty mishap by inputting the wrong purchase date and had to email ASUS about it but hey fixed it for me within a couple days so I was very pleased by that.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-01-05,"Pros:Of five monitors I have owned, this is the best.  Colors are vivid and sharp.  There is no need to adjust the colors.  They are perfect right out of the box. I bought this monitor at the lowest discounted price when it was offered.......a real bargain, but the quality of the monitor is worth the full price.  Here's to ASUS.",Cons:None.  I have read in other reviews about the stand being wobbly.  I have not experienced that.  I don't know about the one watt speakers as I am using my own.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,A lot of monitor for the money,2011-01-04,"Pros:bright clear picture, love the flexibility with VGA,DVI and HDMI. Turns on way faster than my old Sony Trinitron this replaced",Cons:none I can think of so far...,Other Thoughts:I paid around $200. for this monitor and it was money well worth spent and I highly recommend it!!!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Outstanding screen but...,2011-01-04,"Pros:Outstanding colors, Preset are a little bright but nothing a little adjusting can't handle.  Very flashy and expensive looking.  WoW looks great on this screen.","Cons:When I bought this monitor, I noticed a stuck pixel a few days later.  No biggy, sent it back and got another with great ease.  Second one I receive ended up with a stuck pixel as well (nearly in the same spot...right around the middle)  I've decided to keep this one because the stuck pixel rarely shows unlike the last and I personally don't think it's worth considering this a ""damaged"" monitor.  Some would have given more eggs off but I'm choosing to keep this even though I have the option to replace again.",Other Thoughts:I already had the ASUS VW246H and have yet to see a monitor match it's color quality.  I see this monitor and figure it'd be a great addition.  They look outstanding side by side (not to mention you can really see the white pop out on the LED)  Overall this monitor is of high quality and I would recommend it to anyone.....just check it for dead/stuck pixels on arrival.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,ASUS VE247H-Best Buy for the $,2011-01-04,"Pros:Sale price with free shipping was fantastic. Nice wide view screen. Contrast ratio is very good. Colors were easy to set. Stand is as stable as it needs to be, I've seen worse. Not a dead pixel to be found. Easy to navigate the Asus site to register and get warranty info. Output though HDMI watching Blu Ray movies is fantastic to say the least.  Rivals my daughters Samsung 60"" TV for clarity. The ability to tilt the screen gives it points over my previous Samsung which didn't have that feature.","Cons:Button placement could be a little better, but is not enough to take an egg off.","Other Thoughts:Got this as a Christmas gift for myself in an upgrade from a Samsung 21"" monitor.  This rivals the Samsung for picture quality with no problem.  I don't know why other people gripe about a blue tint, maybe its your video card folks.  I've never had an LCD monitor I didn't have to adjust to the way I liked.  Adjustments through the  menu were easy to navigate through and get the colors the way I wanted.  And Honestly folks, if you are relying on a set of monitor speakers to get you through, then you have nothing to complain about. Buy a separate set of speakers and don't be cheap.   With a 2ms response time, playing games (when I do play) is great. No lag, no ghosting.   Buy this monitor, you won't regret it one bit.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Exactly what I expected,2011-01-04,Pros:Price is right. Bezel is relatively simple and small. Excellent contrast. I received the screen in perfect condition; no dead pixels.,"Cons:Height on stand is not adjustable. However, stand is very study and I like it.",Other Thoughts:Been working great for about 2 months.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2011-01-04,"Pros:No backlight bleeding, hurray!Good colors, no dead pixels","Cons:Useless speakers, but I didn't get this monitor for that.",Other Thoughts:Way better than the Acer LED-backlit monitor I got.This monitor probably could've been a couple bucks cheaper if they excluded the speakers.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Less Eye Strain no more headaches,2011-01-04,"Pros:Deep Rich Colors, Best Contrast with even light distribution over the entire screen especially important when I adjust the brightness in the day to compensate for the sun light that shines onto the screen, plus the screen does not reflect that sun light like many of the glossy screens do. I replaced two 23 that were “NOT” LED ‘back light’ and about 3 years old and were not HD..  Because I strain my eyes and get  at work. Even though I paid for these replacement Monitors I think this was a wise choice I am in front of my computer 30-40 hours a week and my comfort and health are worth a couple hundred dollars a monitor. BOTOM LINE ,, Don’t hesitate to buy this ASUS monitor its Awesome!","Cons:This is more of a critique of my personal taste then a con but it’s the only thing negative I have to offer. The piano black exterior casing, IE shiny black plastic ‘many manufactures use this style,.. I do not like this at all it reflects light, shows finger prints, and wares poorly. TAKE NOTICE ASUS “ I have a G7 laptop with the rubbery flat / mat finish and its PERFECT make this monitor with that finish or as an optional retrofit accessory for the people who know its value.","Other Thoughts:The Quality of every aspect of this monitor is world class, sure you could spend more money on a monitor but the visual quality improvement you would get is questionable. About the only thing I see that you can gain from other monitor available that may interest some people would be 2 things, the thickness of the screen and weight which have very limited advantages or value to most people.",0,2
ASUS,VE248H,5,ASUS VE247H,2011-01-03,Pros:Monitor works absolutely beautiful. Love the five different splendor settings. work right out of the box and no dead pixels. Would definately purchase another.,Cons:When connected to HDMI on my video card it leaves about  one inch black space around the edge of the monitor. I switched back to DVI and it work perfectly.,,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,GREAT monitor.,2011-01-02,"Pros:I LOVE this monitor. The resolution of it is great for the size. It is large and very bright. The color is beautiful, and it produces a very crisp, clear image. This monitor is wayyyyy underpriced in my opinion, which is one of the many reasons that I bought it. HDMI is very nice. I love that I can switch between HDMI, DVI, and VGA on three different computers without even unplugging something; all I do is push the shortcut button the bottom of it. This monitor is practically perfect, and it is very much worth its price. It was very easy to setup and unpackage and was working as desired within thirty minutes of unboxing it. I've never been so pleased with a monitor in my entire life.","Cons:There are far less disadvantages than advantages with this monitor so I suggest you simply ignore this entire field of my review. Honestly, the stand is a bit flimsy, but it's not a big deal. When I walk around in the room, the monitor shakes a little. It's not anything serious; at least it can support itself. The internal speakers are rather weak, but I expected them to be. I didn't buy this monitor for the speakers. I would not suggest you using this monitor for your primary speakers if you listen to a lot of music, because it's not that great.","Other Thoughts:I bought this monitor with a Galaxy NVIDIA video card. I installed the card and plugged in the monitor's DVI cable that was included to the monitor and card. I fired up my computer and it was at a very low resolution in the center of the screen, so I installed the NVIDIA driver installation files from the NVIDIA website and ran them. I am using Ubuntu 10.10, by the way. I don't know what it's like on Windows, but I wouldn't doubt if installing the drivers are even simpler. Anyway, installation was a breeze, and I was done within thirty minutes or so. My new ASUS monitor is treating me well!",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,VE248H,2011-01-02,Pros:-Large vibrant display-Good resolution-Thin-Low power-Sturdy stand & connection to stand-Large screen!,Cons:I have notice that I can see maybe the refresh rate or some sort of movement in large areas of light color (such as the blank areas in browser). These aren't enough to actually view when not intentionally looking at them but are important to note.Also I have noticed that very specific colors cause an odd tearing in the display and lines. This is enhanced with some settings. The instance I have noticed was caused by a nature image where the sky tears and refreshes constantly. I've played with the settings to try to remove this and no luck. It can actually be pretty intense at times.,Other Thoughts:Upgraded from an 19'' and am ecstatic to have such a large high res screen!,2,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor!,2011-01-01,"Pros:Very bright and vivid colors, good in high lit rooms, response time, nice shape / look to it, no dead pixels!",Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:Menu takes a bit to get used to if you are new to Asus monitors. Interesting that it has the power and menu buttons below the monitor screen, but it works.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,huanted,2011-01-01,"Pros:It was cheap, and has 5 picture modes that are fully adjustable (except standard mode witch you can not change the saturation and sharpness on for some reason) also no dead pixels or brightness inconsistency.","Cons:Very noticeable ghosting with dark images, and text on white or gray backgrounds. the trials are white (which I find unusual).","Other Thoughts:As I bought this monitor for all around purposes such as Xbox 360, 1080p movies,and a computer monitor The ghosting annoys me to no end. I know companies just list the best response time they can get from a specific test on a specific model (Such as gray to gray with this model) but I did not expect it to Have the worst ghosting of any of my LCDs (I have compared 4 of them too it). I have an old Mitsubishi diamond point V50 LCD that I found in the trash with a 25ms response time, and it does not ghost as bad as this monitor. I do not look forward to the price of returning this monitor.",3,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Excellent Monitor,2011-01-01,"Pros:Very Bright. Very nice colors and pictures are very close to true colors. No defective pixels I can detect. So much more compact than a CRT. Usable controls (once you figure them out). Comes with most basic cables. No driver required either, Windows 7 recognized it without trouble.","Cons:Right now, the only negative I can think of are the written instructions. They are terrible. I am no Luddite, but I had to call ASUS to figure out the controls. Once I understood the logic, everything was fine. Plus, they are written in about a million different languages. A real pain to use.","Other Thoughts:This a beautiful monitor. In fact, once set up, it is a 5 Egg monitor in my mind. I cut an egg for the terrible instructions.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2011-01-01,"Pros:No dead pixels, very bright, very low power usage for the size. 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions look decent and are stretched full screen. Haven't seen any ghosting in games and movies. Includes both VGA and DVI cables.","Cons:Viewing angle not that large, this is true of all LED LCD monitors though. Some of the menu options are grayed out and cannot be selected. Instruction manual mostly worthless.","Other Thoughts:Great monitor for the price. Speakers sound bad, but then again, they are 2 watts. Needs a powerful video card to run games at 1900x1080. My poor Radeon 4670 isn't quite up to the task.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2010-12-31,Pros:This monitor looks very nice and the color is very vibrant.  I could immediately tell the difference from the monitor it replaced.  Asus is a great brand and they have never let me down.The Splendid feature is very nice.  It allows you to change the color scheme and brightness with the touch of a button for different situations.I am definitely glad I got this monitor.,"Cons:The speakers, but I figured that going in to it.  The speakers on monitors are always weak.  I really don't get why they put them on there.",Other Thoughts:Asus and Newegg rocks!,0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,"Great screen, low power usage",2010-12-31,"Pros:This monitor is awesome. Mine did not come with any noticeable pixel defects. I have an old Viewsonic 18"" LCD monitor from 2002 (VG800), and this is *way* brighter, has better colors, and uses less power. According to my Kill-A-Watt, my Viewsonic uses over 40 watts and 3 watts in sleep mode, while this uses 18-20 watts and 1 watt in sleep mode. This is very power efficient.The screen bezel is fairly small, yet it still accommodates basic speakers. Through DVI input, it only takes about a second to turn on and display output.It is so bright that I turned it down to 60% brightness.","Cons:The menu system is not very ergonomic, but it gets the job done.","Other Thoughts:It sounds like the speakers are emitting from somewhere in the back of the screen; they may actually be pointing to the back of the chassis or upward to vents in the top of the monitor. They are good for computer sound effects, but I wouldn't use them for music listening. Still, it is nice to have the option of eliminating speakers.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Dead Pixels Galore,2010-12-31,Pros:The LED backlighting give you very crisp picture.  The monitor supports Ergotron desk mounting.,"Cons:I have ordered 2 of these monitors and both had dead pixels.  Newegg was nice enough to perform Advanced Replacements on both displays, unfortunately, both replacement displays had dead pixels.  I plan to perform one more round of Advanced Replacement, but if they can't get it right this time around, I will likely return both displays and order something else.","Other Thoughts:Perhaps Newegg should add a dead pixel verification step to their Advanced Replacement Process to avoid excessive losses in shipping costs.  It would be impractical to check every monitor before shipping it, but I speculate that it would be feasible to check RMA monitors.  I thought it might have been damaged in shipping, but since no one checks the replacements before they ship there is no way to know.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,LED Technology... VERY NICE,2010-12-31,"Pros:- LED backlighting is wonderful. Reduced my eye strain staring at it for long periods as opposed to a normal LCD screen.- I personally love the colors and I think the default settings were okay, not great. I haven't adjusted them yet though and am getting used to them. Looks VERY natural.- Aesthetically, it's one of the more attractive options out there.- HDMI input is great and just FYI does carry audio to the internal speakers.- Price I paid was more than fair (holiday sale)!- Tilt adjustment is quite versatile.","Cons:- Glossy finish attracts dust and fingerprints and such. Matte doesn't look as good but at least it stays clean.- Stand can be a bit wobbly, but it isn't something to dock an egg for.","Other Thoughts:I've been using the speakers since I've had this for my PS3. They are bad, yes, don't expect miracles, but they WORK and are USEFUL. They are for personal use only and will not be useful for a crowd of people watching something on it as they just don't get that loud. They are fine for dialogue and such, but watching something like Inception on these is going to let you down! This is all common sense but I just wanted to add my 2 cents.*** Also, the menu system is NOT confusing and there is a fair amount of wrong information here. You DO NOT have to access the menu to make the volume/brightness go up or down. To change the volume EITHER WAY without going into the menu, press the ""down"" button which brings up the volume control, then press it again if you want it to decrease, or press the ""up"" button if you want it to increase. To change the brightness, first press the ""up"" button then use the ""up"" and ""down"" buttons similarly.",0,0

This monitor allows you to adjust brightness with the click of the button from having drapes closed to having them open - nice feature. I got mine on sale for under $200 - it was a steal. Even at the current price around $220 this monitor is still the best bargain on the market.,Cons:People that buy this monitor without understanding (or researching) what they are purchasing.,"Other Thoughts:Running this monitor on ATI Radeon 5750 video card; Core i7 860 cpu; 1.5 tb Seagate 7600 rpm hdd; 8 gig ddr3 dram; Plextor Blu-Ray drive.Rig is designed for photography and video editing in Blu-Ray format - monitor responds in precise real time.When I want to get real fancy with adjusting Brightness, contrast and color, I adjust my Radeon 5750 video card.",1,2
ASUS,VE248H,4,Day 1,2010-12-29,Pros:The monitor is light.. looks good aesthetically.. and the picture is bright. No dead pixels out of the box.. setup was actually a breeze. I didn't even need a screwdriver..  I also like the location of the screen controls.. I am still trying to get the settings right. I am running a GTX 260 on a Fx-60 dual core processor with XP-64.,Cons:You will have to play with the settings a bit... It looked a little washed out out of the box. I am still not where I want to e with this.. but I am willing to give it a few days to find the sweet spot.. I will post back here again with an additional review or an update to this one.,Other Thoughts:I haven't tried the speakers at all as I have a 5.1 system..  I actually had sworn off of ASUS due to a motherboard issue a while back with my A7N8X... but I decided to give them another shot... I will see how this pans out. No show stoppers so far.. just some things that need tweaking.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Ah ok....,2010-12-29,Pros:Big!! bright!! Nice looking. Would recommend,Cons:A little ghosting but not a problem in game. I thought it had a green tent out of the box but I fixed that.,Other Thoughts:Good product. I would get another one to dual monitor!!!,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good value for the cost,2010-12-29,"Pros:Low cost, rebate, brightness, LED life expectancy, HD, ease of setup, HDMI connection, great tilt","Cons:the brightness has a very banded aspect. Sitting at normal (24"" or less) distance from the screen, there is a definite area of brightness which moves up and down with your viewpoint. This is more noticable with a dark background. The visual angle of 170 (?) degrees is not an accurate spec. It should be much more narrow. This is replacing a 19"" CRT.","Other Thoughts:Good overall. No noticable dead pixels.

ASUS,VE248H,1,Very Unhappy,2010-12-29,Pros:It's big.,Cons:The monitor has a very dark area in the lower left  corner. It actually covers about a 1/3 of the monitor. The right side looks ok though so I don't don't if it was damaged during shipping or what. IT seems as if the LED's are out of place. I understand things like this happen frequently but to have my sons primary gift be defective,Other Thoughts:I've contacted Newegg about them covering the shipping costs back to California. I live in Maryland and it will cost $25 to send this junk back. If I am forced to cover shipping costs then I want a refund instead of a replacement and I will take my business else where. I have had to send several RMA's back and never asked for them to cover the return shipping but this time I am considering Christmas morning was a bit of a bust.,2,10

ASUS has dead/stuck pixel support for certain monitors only. I'm unable to determin this is one of them as I have been unable to reach ASUS tech support but I fear it isn't. If it turns out that it is, I'd bump up my rating to a 4.Also I seem to have trouble using the monitor with my Xbox 360. Games such as Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, Ace Combat 6 have PS1 like graphics on the monitor. I read about streching being a problem but that seems to be a issue for 1900x1200 monitors. Shouldn't be a problem for a 1920x1080. I'm not entirely sure if it an issue with the monitor or with the configuration as I'm still researching, but thought it's worth mentioning.Overall I feel this montior is good, but not the deal I was hoping for.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor!,2010-12-27,"Pros:This is a great monitor. We bought this for $160 (after rebate) around Xmas and it arrived promptly in about 3 days (Kudos to Newegg). From the moment we turned it on, we were impressed with the vivid colors, brightness, and contrast of this monitor. Some of our old pictures (captured using a DSLR) looked much more real on this monitor as opposed to our older monitor. Would recommend this to anyone.","Cons:1) The switch to control brightness only goes down. The only way to increase brightness is to do it through the menu. Minor point and I dont think you will need to increase the brightness on this one.2) The menu is a bit cumbersome to use and needs getting used to.3) Having a USB hub in the monitor would have been better. But, I am not complaining.","Other Thoughts:We were looking for a monitor with LED backlight (for low power), HDMI input, and >23"". This turned out to be perfect. We were little reluctant before buying this, becasue of the lower number of reviews on Newegg, but decided to go with it anyway due to excellent reputation of Newegg and Asus. That worked out well. The monitor turned out to be great with no dead pixels.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent Buy!,2010-12-26,"Pros:Purchased this about a month ago for my birthday after building a new system over the summer. Wanted a nice monitor to take advantage of my awesome vid card and just wanted an update from my old 21"" with a VGA input.-ZERO dead pixels! :)-LED lighting is excellent, hardly any strain on the eyes and less than half the power consumption of a regular LCD monitor (mine runs between 25-30W)-24"" 16:9, huge picture! The colors are very vivid, picture is beautiful.-HDMI compatible, so you can use it with other electronics (awesome with my PS3, watched season finale of Dexter on it too!)-Light and compact, always nice.-Comes with DVI and VGA cables-Ordered on Monday night, recieved Wednesday morning. Newegg rocks.","Cons:-The only REAL con is that the speakers are sub par but that really isn't an issue at all unless i am sticking my PS3/TV in there and not plugging in speakers with it. Otherwise if i weren't told it has them I wouldn't even know there were speakers.Dispelling some conceived cons:-The stand is a little ""flimsy"" in that the monitor wobbles a bit if you prod it, but it is supported just fine and has no troubles standing.-Default settings are a bit bright at first but a little tweaking (i actually just needed to switch to the ""night time"" pre set), you will forget about it within a day or two.-I can notice a little bit of ghosting when i intentionally try to induce it (dragging firefox window), but only on the toolbar with the gray background and such and not at all on the websites itself. Never noticed any ghosting while gaming or watching movies.","Other Thoughts:Running with a Asus Radeon HD 5850, DVI cables.Overall extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a new monitor.",0,0

Runs cool unlike non-LED monitors.  Draws <35W4.  HDMI input so it can double as a TV.  Mic input as well5.  Speakers built-in although you won't like them.6.  No dead pixels.",Cons:1.  Speakers lack amplitude and have poor sound quality.  HOWEVER they do provide sound and can get the job done.2.  I double-stickied taped a bar speaker under the monitor for better sound.3.

ASUS,VE248H,5,,2010-12-25,"Pros:Absolute amazing display once you tune it up. For some reason, like many others have stated, the factory setting are not all that great. It is a very large screen... I didn't realize 24 inched as this big :D",Cons:Minor ghosting but only on light backgrounds.,"Other Thoughts:Be sure to set it to the correct input setting, I was about to go crazy because it wasn't working with HDMI but I soon realized that the button next to the power button changes the input and all I had to do was select HDMI input.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,"awesome, nothing unexpected",2010-12-25,"Pros:AWESOME AMOUNT OF DOWNWARD TILT! I didn't touch a single setting, just attached the simple one screw mount stand and plugged it in.

ASUS,VE248H,4,The litmus test,2010-12-23,"Pros:I've never owned a 27"" monitor.But this one plays black ops for xbox 360, over hdmi AMAZINGLY!Perfect size.","Cons:The OSD is weird, but only takes like 3 minutes to get used to, 1 minute more than it usually takes, right?.There is some back light unevenness on a full black screen, not too noticeable.Not sure if this is an acceptable level as this is the only large TN panel I've ever owned.  Also only noticeable on a completely black loading screen for example. I played the Hanoi map (a really dark call of duty map) don't remember even thinking back light bleed.Again, I am not sure what acceptable viewing angles would be, compared to say an IPS panel. But these are ok.","Other Thoughts:If you're buying this thing, as I did, for online gaming in your man cave. Then you're probably sitting dead on, and this things will rock your socks.If you're expecting to use this as your main display (possibly with other viewers) tv/console/pc.

It's aesthetically a very nice display, but mine has a horrible ghosting problem. I swapped cables and tried it on my Mac but had the same result.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Excellent monitor value for money,2010-12-22,Pros:Excellent display that has a plenty of user settings to get a perfect screen.  I am just using a VGA connection for now. The factory brightness setting was way too bright and I had to adjust it down.  Good vertical physical adjustment on the monitor and I think the stand is sturdy enough for me.,Cons:The built in 1 Watt speakers are just basic speakers and would be adequate if you didn't have anything else.  I decided to keep using my external speakers instead for better sound when watching HULU movies.   Not a big deal because I didn't buy this monitor for the speaker capability.,"Other Thoughts:I would definitely buy this monitor again and am very pleased with the product right now.  My 5 original criteria for purchasing a monitor were:  24 inch screen, LED backlighting for lower power consumption, VGA/ DVI/HDMI connections, a three year warranty, and a low overall cost.  The ASUS VE247H was a perfect match.",4,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2010-12-22,Pros:Everything,"Cons:People who get worked up by other's ""personal"" opinions about the product. That is what a personal review is. If you want in-depth, look for professional reviews.","Other Thoughts:I use it with a desktop. I use an i7-950 processor with it. I have 6gb of ram. I have it sitting on a wooden desk. A webcam fits on the top perfectly without disrupting any of the monitor's features. I wear contacts most of the time and also glasses sometimes and it looks the same either way.

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Seriously, a great buy",2010-12-21,"Pros:Just upgraded from Dell UltraSharp 2005FPW 20.1"" dual monitor display to two of these. After plugging them in (running on a Radeon 4850 via DVI-D, they were immediately discovered by Windows ATI Catalyst drivers. The 1080p settings easily applied... and, voila, there is more real estate to deal with.They are light and bright and provide crisp and clear text.Zero dead pixels.Packaging was adequate.Newegg gets cudos too, because I ordered Monday morning, and Tuesday afternoon they were in my possession (given they shipped from Edison, NJ to Queens, NY via UPS Ground)","Cons:As many other reviewers mentioned, the stands seem a little flimsy, but mine will be wall mounted soon anyway.The controls take a bit getting used to, but","Other Thoughts:If one more person complains about the speakers being ""tinny"", I think I will flip. In all reality, I wish that ASUS made these without Speakers at all and using the real estate to build-in a USB hub (which I'll miss from my Dells, as I used them to quickly plug-in my BBY, IPhone, camera, etc).

If not for ""Cons' I would have a five star rating here","Cons:WARRANTY VOIDING STICKER IS HORRIBLE! I felt plastic and thought it was more protective plastic, it was jutting carelessly off the back. So I peeled it. It felt like your typical window sticker and came off easier than the sticker on the front that pointed to the controls. looked at it. Warranty void. Motherf---- That was so well placed, that it was absolutely not a mistake. ASUS did this intentionally, though I couldn't imagine why. Is this model known to be failure prone or what?Half the sticker wasn't even stuck to the monitor. What the hell, ASUS?So now my warranty is toast on day 1. Thanks, ASUS. May as well just sell it without a warranty.","Other Thoughts:If ASUS would re-instate my warranty somehow, theyll get five stars back. Won't happen.",4,17
ASUS,VE248H,4,bright led monitor,2010-12-20,"Pros:the monitor is really bright, i have to turn it down to 30%.

ASUS,VE248H,4,Great for the price,2010-12-20,Pros:Excellent monitor when viewed head on. Fast response and nice color for a TN Panel. Low power consumption. Nice selection of inputs.,"Cons:Display Port is a bit finicky. PnP does not work with HDMI as far as I can tell. Not the greatest menu button layout. On the first one I bought, sometimes when I first power it on, I see a faint white band going down a little off center of the screen. Goes away after a while.","Other Thoughts:It's obvious Asus changed the panels in the latest production batch of this monitor. I first bought this monitor back in October 2010 (tag says it was made in August), and the viewing angles and colors were great (for a TN). After a couple weeks I decide I want to get another for a dual setup, but then it sold out. So fast forward two months later, Newegg gets a new batch, and I put in my order. This monitor has a tag saying it was made in November 2010 and when putting it beside the August monitor, it's clear that the viewing angles are worse. And even after multiple color calibrations of both monitors, the Nov. model still can't quite match the colors of the Aug model.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,2,Awful Stay Away and Read All the Reviews,2010-12-20,"Pros:LED so supposedly lower energy use, no easy way for me to test. But no thinner than other LCDs, and poor quality so who cares...Currently RMAing through Asus, and seems that they are dealing with the problem, paying for shipping both ways etc. Will update if I run into any positive or negatives on this front.Seems as if this monitor is very much hit or miss...I just hope my replacement doesn't have the same issue, or dead pixels than what?","Cons:Monitor looses video signal screen goes black, you have to power it off and turn it back on. Read the reviews this happening to many, and using different cables, so not as if it is just HDMI, or DVI, so no workaround.Yes I realize the monitor can be and needs to be adjusted out of the box, but the quality of text, photos and videos is really lacking, and I am comparing it to the same size, price points, both Dell, Hannspree (sp?), and Samsung. I also have two dead pixels.Extreme bleeding, edges much ""whiter"" than the center, but others say they see none, maybe just mine.Expensive compared to other 27"" monitors. Not all that thin, or stylish like say Samsungs...Scratch in finish, finger print magnet, I know that is a fault of all glossy finished items. Stand itself, and monitor ""feel"" cheaply made.","Other Thoughts:I don't understand how people say monitor shuts off, had to RMA it, but still give it four out of five stars? And as you can see I am not the only one with this issue.Another reviewer writes ""hurts on the eyes at times but i'm slowing getting used to it (not good lol!)"" - and he/she gave it five stars?""My unit sits *decidedly* cockeyed to the right, not level. As far as I can tell, the plastic is molded crooked! (The swivel joint on the back of the unit, not the foot.) It's not slightly, but definitely. More than 1/4"" drop from left to right"" - another four stars?As I said in the Pros, some, in fact many seem to like it, so maybe this is a real hit or miss product?

Don’t know why ASUS jacked up the contract so high in some of the pre-sets, it’s to the point of blinding you.

There is a reason why other monitors cost $500, $1000, etc.","Other Thoughts:Requires calibration: I sent the monitor brightness to 100, contrast to 70.

I am using the analog input only because that's all her computer had, but the picture is still very good.","Cons:It's 1080p instead of 1200p, but that's really minor and no fault of the monitor.The speakers are not very loud, but they are clear.","Other Thoughts:I bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't tear herself away from it.  Her body hurt from sitting at it for hours on end.The extra screen real estate compared to her old monitor has made a huge difference in the enjoyment of using the computer.  It's almost like getting a new computer.The only way to make this better is to get two of these and run dual monitors.  Once you go dual, you can never go back to a single monitor.For those who have not yet made the transition to wide screen, all I can say is that you will never have any regrets for making the move.One last thing...For years I've told people to buy a computer in the midrange price and splurge on a great monitor.

Unless you are a pro of some sort, I see no reason to be as picky as a lot of the reviews are... And if you are a pro, I would imagine you would spend quite  a bit more for a monitor. Also the monitor is a little wobbly, but you are placing almost ten pounds of monitor on a little base so what do you expect?",2,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Wow. This is what color is supposed to look like!,2010-12-15,"Pros:Just upgraded from a Viewsonic 22'' VX2235wm LCD and all I've got to say is wow. I have never seen colors this vivid and sharp.  Got this at $200 w/ the NewEgg coupon, and I'm very happy with my purchase. Settings needed some adjusting and they have a few viewing modes which help with that.The LED aspect of this monitor makes it VERY easy on the eyes, and 24"" is a perfect size, not too big or small.Also, the stand is quite sturdy.",Cons:Can't see any cons right now.  My only issue is that the stand is quite a bit shorter than my old monitor. Can't remove an egg for that though.,"Other Thoughts:I had to do some finagling with the HDMI cable (Purchased separately since the monitor doesn't come with one) for my PC to detect it properly. Initially it did not detect HDMI, so I plugged in the DVI cable, too. So now it seems like my PC detects DVI on start-up and HDMI after start-up is complete. That's probably just my comp settings but thought I'd let it be known.Also, when everything was up and running, there was a black border around the screen. Apparently it has to do with scaling and you can fix that by going to your graphics card control panel and changing the scaling for your monitor to 0% (for ATI 5770).Other than that, this is a great ASUS monitor. Thanks NewEgg!",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,First Impressions,2010-12-15,"Pros:No dead pixels. Easy setup. Very good black levels but it takes some tinkering to get the colors to look right. There is a little bit of light bleeding from the edges but its only noticeable on a black background and not nearly as bad as a non-LED backlit display. Screen size is good although I was using a 26"" 720p HDTV as a monitor before so the smaller size will take some getting used to, but the image quality makes up for that. The thin bezel also reduces some bulk on my desk. The speakers I will list in the pros merely for the fact that it has speakers. They're pretty bad but convenient if needed. The hole in the back of the stand is great for cable management. I can't see any cables coming out from behind the screen. Newegg was fantastic; I ordered this at 11pm on a Sunday to take advantage of a $20 discount and free shipping and it arrived on Tuesday.","Cons:There is some very noticeable ghosting on lighter backgrounds when moving the cursor around. Before this monitor I had never experienced ghosting and didn't really know what it looked like but now I do. (Not blaming the monitor; this is just my first LCD computer monitor) You can search for this monitor on the ""tube"" for video proof. I haven't seen any ghosting during gaming although I haven't had too much time to test it yet. The display settings out of the box are pretty bad. There seems to be an awful lot of heat on only the right side of the screen. Not sure if that is normal.","Other Thoughts:Overall, this is a pretty good monitor. The image quality is very good aside from the ghosting. It doesn't really bother me too much and I don't quite understand why people obsess over it so much if it doesn't affect gaming. Maybe I'm missing something. The heat coming off of the right side of the screen worries me so I'm not sure if I will keep this monitor.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Reality In A Box,2010-12-14,Pros:I bought this as an open box and i was so surprised from the results that i thought i installed a window on my wall and not a TV i have it hocked up to my 360 through HDMI and its so clear and for the price how can you beat it?,Cons:Maybe a second HDMI but that's what splitters are for,Other Thoughts:The cable placement is great for VESA wall mount so i can have it .55 inches from the wall because the cables hang down.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Read the specs b4 you buy,2010-12-14,"Pros:It is sad to see so many bogus reviews on this web site.This monitor has ""BACKLIGHTING"" which is used to counteract a ""BRIGHTLY LIT"" room.  If your curtains are open and the sun is shining in, you can see the monitor much better with the backlighting.Stop whining about it being ""so bright"" and the factory adjustments. Just adjust it to how you need it to be.",Cons:People that post on here and don't provide any relevant rational comments.,"Other Thoughts:The screen might be ""too bright"" for you because you are a mushroom in your momma's basement. So, just adjust it to how you need it for your application.Those that are using it in a ""brightly lit"" room will have a differing ""OPINION"".This has nothing to do with the quality, specs and integrity of the product.Dust magnet because of materials is good to know.Does the menu have good features that are easy to adjust? Good to know.Does the picture on the screen respond in real time and are you using it for gaming, autocad, surfing, watching video??? These would be good rational comments.Are you using a Pentium 2 processor or core i7 - good to know as this would add credence to the previous sentence.What graphics card are you using? Maybe that has something to do with ""Bright"" comments. Maybe you need to adjust your graphics card.1w speakers ""sound like a tin can"". Oh my word, I never knew 1w speakers could be so bad.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Definitely worth it!,2010-12-09,"Pros:Very bright/vivid.  1080p.  2ms G2G is great for games.  Text is crisp and smooth.  Lighting is perfectly even over whole screen.  No dead pixels.  Cables plug in face-down (instead of straight out the back) which is a huge plus for me because my desk doesn't come out too far from the wall, and I am still able to push it back pretty far.  The power light is on the bottom and faces down so there is 0 distraction.People have complained about the default colors, but that isn't really an issue for me.  There are plenty of pre-set color settings to change it to (Standard, Night Viewing, Theater, Gaming) plus you can tweak every single option, so you can make the colors whatever you want.","Cons:The stand wobbles very slightly when I type semi-aggressively on the keyboard.  This is completely not an issue, but I just hope that it doesn't get progressively worse and become an issue over time.  It is pretty sturdy as of now.",Other Thoughts:There is very noticeable color distortion (goes towards yellow) as your viewing angle changes to around 45-degrees.   This is not a con because this is a computer monitor and I will always be sitting directly in front of it;  I am just mentioning this in case someone wanted to also use this as a TV or something with a wide-range of viewing angles-- maybe not the best choice.,12,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,A fine monitor with a poor stand,2010-12-03,"Pros:As a software developer (as opposed to gamer) I don't notice the ghosting and other response complaints made by a few users in the other reviews.  For office/coding type work this is an excellent monitor.  Default settings are on the cool side for my taste, which is trvial to adjust.  Easy to look at for 10-14 hours a day, which is what I have to do. Power consumption is excellent.","Cons:The stand isn't height adjustable.  I knew that going in, but If I'd been able to find a price-competitive monitor with a height adjustable base I would have bought it instead of this model; something for ASUS marketing folks to consider.","Other Thoughts:Not a criticism of this monitor per se, but of the general trend toward 1920 x 1080.  I know this is the new ""standard"" but in terms of screen real-estate I really prefer 1920 x 1200, which my older monitors provide.  Swimming against the tide on this one I suppose.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Beautiful,2010-12-03,"Pros:This has the best picture i've ever seen on a monitor. I also own a 24"" Asus LCD and had to buy this since it was basically the same monitor but in LED format. The clarity and overall quality on the old one can't even compare to this one. The stand on this one is quite different from the older asus lcd monitors, you get alot more forward tilt, which is helpful since my monitor has always been at or above eye level and the older stands couldnt tilt forward enough, so i always had a darker than normal picture due to the viewing angle. Aside from that the entire monitor is glossy black including the back of the monitor and the stand, older Asus lcd models would have the glossy black bezel but matte black backside. Buttons are on the bottom and are actually buttons you can feel for once instead of the usual small sliver of plastic or indent. If you want an awesome LED monitor for a low price this is the one to get.",Cons:None that i have come across.,Other Thoughts:My desktop is hooked up to 5.1 and i haven't tried the monitors speakers so i can't comment on their quality.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Newegg rocks,2010-12-03,Pros:Monitor would not power up when shut down using display port.

ASUS,VE248H,3,Great Screen Faulty DisplayPort,2010-12-02,"Pros:Great 27 inch Monitor, awesome response time and good color ratios. Also very bright and clear.",Cons:Through buying 2 different DisplayPort Cables I have come to realize that the DisplayPort Port on the Monitor is faulty and emits a pulsating noise none stop unless the monitor sound is muted though the picture is fine. Instead of going through the hassle of return shipping a monitor im stuck using the HDMI Port.,Other Thoughts:I Think this is my last large purchase from Newegg since it is way to much hassle to return something if it is faulty since it is a web retailer. I'd rather pay a little extra at a local store and have the option of a quick and convenient return if something is wrong. Great Monitor other than a faulty DisplayPort,2,3
ASUS,VE248H,4,,2010-12-02,"Pros:Fast, bright, handful of gamma curves to choose from (game, theatre, night, etc), no dead pixels, largest pixels available for a high-rez ""computer"" LCD, low power LED -- no waiting for CCFL to warm-up.","Cons:Non-defeatable built-in video deinterlacing (look carefully at the edges of a window as it is dragged around!) -- can turn ""trace free"" option to 0, but it's still there slightly.My unit sits *decidedly* cockeyed to the right, not level.  As far as I can tell, the plastic is molded crooked!  (The swivel joint on the back of the unit, not the foot.)  It's not slightly, but definitely.  More than 1/4"" drop from left to right.","Other Thoughts:It's a TN panel, with the expected gamma shift.  Button arrangement take a little getting used to, but you'll adapt.",0,1
ASUS,VE248H,3,Dead/Stuck Pixel,2010-12-02,"Pros:Monitor is amazing, love the design of the monitor and the fact the base actually lets you tilt this monitor forward since a lot don't. This is my first LED monitor and it's amazing. Colors look awesome after messing with the settings a bit and using the Windows 7 calibration tool.","Cons:Would have been a 5/5 if wasn't for the manufacturing errors.First monitor arrived and it had one dead pixel, luckily Newegg customer service is awesome and issued a replacement with free shipping. However my second monitor arrived and this time it had one stuck pixel, I don't plan on returning this one because the placement of the stuck pixel makes it almost impossible to see while playing games or browsing the web, which is all I really do on my PC anyways.No one else in the reviews I read got one with a dead or stuck pixel so I guess I'm just extremely unlucky, the stuck pixel is also not the type you can fix, it seems to be a manufacturing error in the film layer as the pixel appears to be different colors from different angles.Besides the pixels the only con I find with the monitor isweak speakers, not a problem for me since I don't use them anyways, but I tried them on my PS3 and it sounds like you're playing inside a tin can.","Other Thoughts:Not really a con but the buttons for the monitor are REALLY awkward for navigating the monitor's menu, but this is hardly an issue since after setting everything up the first time you shouldn't have to mess with the menu that often.Again I am really happy with Newegg support.",0,1

ASUS,VE248H,5,"Excellent Clarity, Outstanding Brightness",2010-12-01,"Pros:Regardless of what the actual specs are, this monitor is very nice. Full 1080p resolution and an HDMI in made it the perfect candidate for my tri setup.  It's a bit wide for the height when compared to what I'm used to, but the aspect ratio is spot on, so I just have to get over it.It's incredibly bright, and the colors are astounding.  I highly suggest this monitor to anyone looking to purchase one on either a budget or just as a second (I still think a 25"" should be the standard size for a primary display) :)Two thumbs way, way up.","Cons:There is no adjustable height, the stand only swivels back and forth.",,1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great Monitor,2010-11-29,Pros:Excellent color and contrast.  Beats LCD especially with issues with lamp light leakage common with LCD.  Perfect monitor for blu ray as well.,"Cons:Typically, as with other computer monitors of this type, the speakers are very poor, but there is an audio jack for external speakers or headphones which for me makes up for it.  Really wish they would put a separate mute/volume control aside from having to navigate the menu.",Other Thoughts:Package arrived in a very beat-up box.

Colors are pretty washed out until you make adjustments.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Almost Perfect...,2010-11-28,"Pros:Looks good, setup was easy.Brighter, Larger, and Lighter then my old monitor.

ASUS,VE248H,5,No complaints,2010-11-27,Pros:This monitor is great dollar for dollar I couldn't have found anything to match its quality. there are a few preset settings but you can easily change to your own preference.,Cons:Picture in picture can only function if there is one digital source and one analog source. Such as hdmi and dvi can not work together for pip. but either of those would work with vga or Displayport.,Other Thoughts:Even with the pip issue there is absolutely nothing I dislike about this monitor.,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Beauty is only skin deep!,2010-11-27,"Pros:Big, pretty screen, major manufacturer, good contrast/brightness. Colors are sharp. Obviously no issues with installation, provided VGA, DVI and HDMI slots. Cheap, too.","Cons:The menu system takes a bit of figuring out, not the most intuitive scheme I've ever seen. Glossy surface loves dust and fingerprints, but matte screen surface is nice.",Other Thoughts:Honestly there's not a lot better in this price range,2,1
ASUS,VE248H,2,Bought and returned,2010-11-27,"Pros:I liked the real-estate of the screen size - everyone that saw it on my desk thought it was bigger than 24"". The colors were vibrant and the LED lighting was great (I had no issues with edge bleeding).","Cons:There was definitely ghosting present. Ghosting was especially apparent when I was viewing white background Websites like Facebook and Google. By ghosting, I mean I can see a trail behind my mouse (and no I do not have a trail setting set up on my mouse settings). Furthermore, when I am scrolling via the mouse-wheel I see text on the screen leaving behind a vertical trail as well (this is only apparent on light white backgrounds). Strangely enough, when I am dragging a scroll bar instead of using the mouse wheel the text ghosting is not as visible...this may be due to the response rate timing (manually dragging scroll bars v.s. mouse scrolling).Worst of all, there was a dead pixel - just ONE dead pixel smack in the middle of the screen on the right-side. I tried all of the tricks you can find online to attempt to make it go away but the dead pixel stayed vigilant.In the end, I could not deal with the ghosting, and the dead pixel was just too irksome for a brand-new monitor.","Other Thoughts:I would have kept the monitor had there been no ghosting and no dead pixel...I do not believe I would have kept the monitor even if there was no dead pixel - the ghosting was simply unacceptable to me. 2ms GTG is pretty deceiving - especially since there's really no standard measure for these response rates. I would have to say that this display is really 5ms at best...maybe even a 6ms. And any ads or reviews that says that there is no ghosting or ""minimal ghosting"" isn't spitting the whole truth...Maybe it was just me, but mine definitely had some pretty disgusting ghosting for a display screen that boasts such great specifications in its description.",4,1
ASUS,VE248H,5,Almost Flawless,2010-11-26,"Pros:The overall picture quality is very good. No ""bleeding"" of light from the edges when watching a dark movie or viewing anything with a black background. The preset ""theater mode"" gives excellent color accuracy. Power LED isn't too bright like on many other monitors. Screen is matte so reflections from lamps or windows is not visible. Built in speakers if you are tight on space. VERY good stand. Menu system is not confusing. Monitor itself runs very cool and barely gets warm. Easy to adjust brightness/volume. Bezel around the display is pretty thin so having 2 or more of these monitors next to each other shouldn't be a problem.",Cons:Glossy plastic frame so it tends to attract dust. The stand itself does not swivel left/right.,Other Thoughts:Not the thinest monitor in it's class but is very light weight.,0,0

It also only has one hdmi port and one dvi, but no biggie, just a minor headache if you have many things to plug in. menu system is a little funky, but i got used to it quick",Other Thoughts:Cannot go wrong with this monitor,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Very good for the price. Easy on the eyes.,2010-11-24,"Pros:This monitor is big, bright, and beautiful. The LED back-lighting supplies vibrant visuals that are still easy on the eyes and yet the monitor doesn't radiate like a space heater. Once adjusted, the lines are clean, crisp, and clear and the depth of the palette is amazing. With six (6) display modes and three (3) 'temperature' settings, you can achieve a fantastic look for all types of viewing. As a software developer, I appreciate a monitor I can gaze at for hours at a time without the eyestrain that harsh lighting can give you. Fantastic.","Cons:My rating would be perfect were it not for a couple of minor, but not insignificant quarrels. First, as other reviewers have indicated, the out-of-box setup is less than ideal and will likely require some tuning on the part of the user. If this is your only monitor, you may not notice, but the standard visuals looked a little mushy to me. Although I could fix some of these issues through my video card software, I did have to adjust the hardware settings, and this brings me to the second problem. The menu system on the actual monitor is cludgy to say the least. Buttons have different uses in different contexts and the order of the buttons on the monitor feels awkward when navigating menus. Smaller quibbles are that I prefer touch style buttons rather than push, and a remote would have been nice given the menu issue. The stand is a little on the short side too.","Other Thoughts:The biggest issue I have with all monitors this size is that it seems impossible to get something over 23"" with more than 1920X1080 resolution. Using a monitor this size and this close I definitely notice the pixel edges more than I do on the 23"" Samsung 2343 I use along-side this one. The 2343 displays at 2048x1152, but I haven't found a monitor that has the same kind of display quality and the same resolution in the 25""- 30"" range. If anyone knows of one, I'm interested.",5,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Good for the price.,2010-11-23,"Pros:- Great picture, super bright- Size- LED backlighting,- VGA/DVI/HDMI inputs- Price- Speakers included","Cons:- Speakers are weak, but are ok for casual audio- 1080p resolution is not enough vertically, but this monitorpriced well, so ...","Other Thoughts:Bought two of these and they are great for a dual monitorsetup. VGA, DVI, HDMI (audio and video) work fine. Haven'ttried the 3.5mm audio in&out yet.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,LED backlit brilliance for the desktop,2010-11-23,"Pros:This is a visually stunning monitor that is startlingly light and slim for its size, even for an LCD monitor.  The LED backlight delivers an astounding contrast ratio, with rich, dense blacks.  Black on this monitor is not ""sort of dark"", it's ""black as the pits of hell"", especially in theater mode.Speaking of theater mode, many users will probably like the ASUS's multitude of preset ""Splendid Video"" color-calibration modes - including graphic designers, who will undoubtedly want to use the precalibrated sRGB mode.  Personally, I left it in Standard mode and set it to 9300K (""cool"") color temperature.  I like my screens to look as though daylit, not like reading a book under a 40W incandescent bulb, and at 9300K, that's what you get.The screen is stunningly fast, with no blurring or ghosting whatsoever, and with excellent off-angle color stability.  There is some off-axis darkening, but no color shift or reversal.","Cons:The stand is ... weak.  It offers tilt only, is too low, and is rather stiff to adjust.  Consider buying an adjustable monitor arm to go with this monitor.Also, the resolution is only 1920x1080, not a full 1920x1200.  Yes, I understand that 1920x1080 is ideal for watching HD video.  But, you know, I bought this as a monitor, not as a TV, and having gotten used to a screen 1200 pixels tall, I miss that last 120 pixels.Then again, this isn't a fault that can be leveled solely at ASUS.  The entire industry has de facto gone over to HDTV resolutions.  The days of the 1600x1200 or 1920x1200 monitor have all but ended.  They're practically pure unobtainium these days.  There is *ONE* 1920x1200 monitor on the market in this size range, and without naming the brand, I've had such a bad experience with mine I wouldn't ever buy another.","Other Thoughts:ASUS seems to be the first company to introduce LED backlights across their entire monitor line, and the results are impressive.  It's not just the astounding contrast ratio and the dense, rich blacks, although those are what will catch your eye.  There are non-obvious benefits too.  This 27"" ASUS monitor draws half the power of the 28"" Hanns-G it's replacing.  That translates into half the heat dissipation, so the monitor will stay cooler and last longer.  Also, the LED backlight will, to all practical purposes, never wear out.  CCFL replacements will be a thing of the past with this entire line of monitors.Technically this monitor is not as bright in candelas per meter squared as some other LCD monitors.  But don't let that bother you.  Trust me, you're not going to notice any lack, especially with ASUS' AI Light feature that adjusts brightness to the ambient light level.",5,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Love it!,2010-11-22,"Pros:LOVE the LED, this is an accessory screen that sits upright (portrait style) next to my LG 30"" LCD which is my primary and I never realized the difference of LED vs regular LCD technology until using them side by side!!  The new LED screen is ON FULL BRIGHTNESS INSTANTLY and my $1,500 30” LCD looks dim for a good few minutes while it warms up.  I love 27"" at 1920x1080, everything is HUGE compared to my 30"" running 2560x1600.  I use the Asus 27” for web browsing and Outlook and it is amazing looking at such a large screen in portrait position, hardly EVER have to scroll on a website.  One last thought, I have tried a number of monitors in a portrait style position and found many of them get blurry when used that way, THIS one does not, it is just as clear in portrait as it is in landscape.  CHEAP price for such a nice 27"" monitor!  At that price everyone should have one!","Cons:Wish it was the super skinny style like most new LED's are.  My 50"" LED tv is thinner than this monitor.I purchased 4 of these, one of them needed to be RMA'ed and I had to pay shipping of like $21 through UPS to send it back to NewEgg.  The screen was flickering and turning off for a few seconds.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this screen to ANYONE I know.  I don't use the Asus 27"" for gaming, when I do game the 30"" is what I use, so I couldn't say how it looks with gaming.  These are installed on a Ergotron arm system and the weight of the monitors are not too much for the arms.  I get a lot of remarks from people when they see these big screens side by side, looks impressive!",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great monitor,2010-11-22,"Pros:Amazing picture on the monitor. So far games and movies look great. No tracers. Very bright, great contrast and little to no back light bleed. Not a single dead pixel. Runs very cool compared to the Hanns-G 22inch it's replacing. And according to my Kill-A-Watt it uses about half the power. Screen has a matte finish, which I prefer.",Cons:Could live without the glossy finish of the case. Looks sleek but may be hard to keep clean.,Other Thoughts:Can't speak to the quality of the speakers. I doubt that I'll ever even hook them up.  I use a Kenwood 1000 W surround sound system. And honestly if you want a rich full sound why on earth would you use built in speakers in the first place?,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,,2010-11-22,"Pros:Great price. Settings can be adjusted to anyway you want. Took me a bit to find the perfect way for me, but worth it. Compared to the 23in LED i bought earlier and returned, I saved 130$ for a better quality monitor. I do prefer the cables to point towards the floor, rather then straight out the back, so this was a huge plus as well, allowing me to push the monitor back and on the desk ans use the desk space.",Cons:none,Other Thoughts:Thinking ill buy another at this price and use them both.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Great midsize monitor,2010-11-22,"Pros:Bright, very clear and easy to read, no dead pixels. Monitor is light, but seems quite sturdy. The stand, the foot of which is about the size and shape of a salad plate, is quite stable. Monitor sits low (about 4 inches off desk surface), so it is easy to tilt to the optimum viewing angle, even for me, a dinky 5 ft 1.","Cons:Nothing substantial-  The 'quick start guide"" that comes with the monitor is laughable- it identifies the buttons, but not how they work. If you are, like me at a tech level 1 or even 0.5, download the full user guide for the monitor before trying to set it up. The optimum viewing angle is limited, but  the low position of the monitor and its light weight make it easy to adjust.","Other Thoughts:I have a small computer desk, and this is a ""Goldilocks"" monitor- 19"" would be too small, and 24"" too big. It took me a while to get it to work with my netbook, but that is because I am a moron in terms of technical smarts.",0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,WOW! Just WOW!,2010-11-21,"Pros:1080P monitor, 2ms refresh rate, LED back lit, HDMI in, NO DEAD/STUCK Pixels! This screen has very nice colors and very nice over all look and feel to it. Has a non-glossy screen so you get no reflections at all. BIIIIIIGGG. I used to use my VH222H as my primary monitor, and this is roughly 2"" larger and I notice the difference. Games look fantastic on this, especially Reach.","Cons:I don't want to take off the sticky protective clear around the edges and base...At first the monitor didn't look right, and that's because it wasn't. If the picture looks kinda washed out, it's your gamma settings. This particular monitor doesn't mess with gamma settings so I used the one built into windows and fixed it properly.","Other Thoughts:Colors finally look true to their color. White's are white, blue's blue, etc...This monitor doesn't come factory settings perfect, you will have to tweak it a bit to make it look exactly the way you want it to.W7 Pro x64GTX 260",6,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Fantastic monitor!,2010-11-21,Pros:The last item on my build.  The monitor was easy to set up out of the box.  Great bright picture even with the brightness level set at only 55%.  LED backlight is much better than fluorescent.  Absolutely no bad pixels.  The text is sharp (using ClearType settings to remove typical jaggies on digital displays) and the colors are vibrant.  Glad I got this one!,"Cons:HDMI connection from a XFX ATI 5770 graphics card resulted in an unused boarder around the outer edge of the monitor of about an inch.

I tried it with two computers and with several cable combinations.  The ghosting didn't go away.  Thats kinda sad.The viewing angles are not as good as advertised.  There is a definite color shift when viewing them too far to the sides, about 45 to 60 degrees.  If you view the monitor from too high, the colors get washed out.","Other Thoughts:I wish I could say I love this monitor.  it has a lot going for it.

And it just doesn't have it.I tried this with a T400 on an advanced minidock with VGA and DVI cables, as well as a HIS 5770 videocard with DVI, VGA & DVI Adapater, and Sapphire active Displayport adapter to DVI.

Coming off a Sammy 19"" I had for years, this monitor is a nice upgrade. I use the DVI input off my PC and the XFX Radeon 5770 handles the native resolution well.

For monitor-speakers they're fine.","Cons:-The bezel isn't tight against the screen in some places, specifically the top.  Seems pretty cheap.  Note - this seems to be common with lower-end inexpensive monitors.-That's it for now.","Other Thoughts:As many have said, the ""warranty void if sticker broken"" sticker is on top of the protective film, so you have no choice but to remove it.  I contacted Asus customer support and they assured me that it's not an issue, and they don't even know why the stickers exist at all.  You will not void your warranty.I'm not a professional videophile, nor a gamer, nor have I calibrated this thing yet, so take this for what it's worth.  My initial experience has been good.

It's not a con big enough to take off an egg for.","Other Thoughts:People on Newegg should stop submitting stupid reviews. Of course this doesn't have USB connections...of course its not height adjustable. For this price, you WILL NOT find these features on such a monitor of this caliber.

I've ordered a hardware calibrator because I really want to like this screen so I'll update once it's calibrated.  After fiddling with the settings for an hour I couldn't come close to acceptable colors, everything looks faded and washed out (again it's sitting next to an IPS panel but I didn't expect it to be this dramatic).Going from 1920x1200 to 1920x1080 is more dramatic than I thought it would be, the former res is noticeably superior for all but gaming.  My browser now feels squished.",Other Thoughts:As far as a TN panel goes this is about par for the course.  If you don't have an IPS panel sitting right next to it and you are not as picky as I then this might be a great screen.  Overall I was expecting much more from this panel.,2,6

The difference in quality and size is just shocking.Size wise, I honestly don't know how I used to work on the old monitor.

Easy to adjust with the settings on the menu, while time consuming it's easy to find your 'perfect settings'3. The resolution is perfect for gaming, 1920 x 1080 makes for an excellent gaming experience and still is a great monitor for normal computing4. Solid Stand and nice quality material5. NO DEAD PIXELS!!!","Cons:1. This thing is BIG, I severely underestimated the size of this thing when I got it. I had to clear off a good portion of my desk to make room, make sure you know how much space you have before buying.2. Tilting the monitor kinda made me uneasy, this thing does not adjust easily, and I had to apply a bit more force than comfortable to tilt it to my liking. No damage, and I suppose it makes it more solid, so I'll add it in anyway.3. This thing is bright, while staring at a white screen (Facebook) for a while my eyes can feel it. Adjusting brightness is easy though.4. Wish it had a higher refresh rate, but that's just me being nit picky.","Other Thoughts:Newegg's shipping got it here in 1 day. Shipped on Monday, was here Tuesday. VERY PLEASED.After setting it all up and hooking it up, started gaming on it, very nice. No dead pixels.I was hesitant to buy this, but now that I got it I'm very glad I did. Asus did a very good job in making this monitor.

ASUS ""Splendid"" video modes.","Cons:As others have said, the menu system controlled by buttons on the bottom of the monitor is awkward.  Since I WAS able to use it, this problem was insignificant to me.  The speakers are weak but I don't use them.","Other Thoughts:I did not think I would find the ""Splendid"" video modes useful but the default display mode provided colors that seemed washed out to me.  Switching to ""Theater Mode"" provided the color saturation I was looking for.My previous monitor, a Samsung 2232BW, had a 22 inch screen with a 16x10 aspect ration.

I have 2 of ASUS MS238H already and they are fantastic.  I was really looking forward to the extras on the VE248H.  I expected the monitor performance to be equal to the other ASUS monitors.

I compared side by side with MS238 on the same PC, spent hours trying various approaches such as using Spyder calibration equipment, duplicating contrast/sharpness settings, etc. The VE248H remained fuzzy and unusable.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Great!,2010-11-01,"Pros:Ordered this LED little over a week ago, got here fast as always, ZERO dead pixels.  I was going from a high end crt and worried it would'nt match the detail, but it looks great very sharp and clear, extremely vivid colors size is just right for me, not to big definitely not to small =)Newer LED tech, very low power all for a very low price, imo after looking for awhile this is one of the best deals you can get atm ( $ 159 at this time )",Cons:If you are coming from a high detailed CRT ( I know theres more out there ) you will have to toy with the setings a little and just get use to it in general but it is well worth the size and quality!,,3,1

ASUS,VE248H,5,Really small bezel!,2010-10-19,Pros:Full LED is great with the brightness and the 2ms response time is awesome. Plus the bezel is really small which is why i bought this monitor and 2 others for eyefinity. Light weight and doesn't tip easily. Another reason that i bought this was because of the DVI which a lot of the other asus monitors dont have.,Cons:none.,,1,0
ASUS,VE248H,1,Vertical red line down the center,2010-10-19,Pros:It displays a picture.,"Cons:I am big supporter of ASUS product and have never had a problem with there product; however, was very disappointed when I received the VE278Q monitor.  A vertical red line ran down the center of the monitor and there were several dead pixels.  I hope this is a fluke and am sending it back for a replacement.  Has anyone experienced the same problem?  Customer service was no where to be found.   I gave it one star b/c it turned on.  Will keep you guys updated.",,2,12
ASUS,VE248H,5,VE278Q is the name of Excellence,2010-10-19,"Pros:Before the LED backlight ASUS VE278Q I tried an ASUS VW266H which had a number of immediately discernable flaws I could not live with. Luckily Newegg did an RMA on the VW266H (no restocking fee and no S&H fee). The ASUS VE278Q is worlds apart and far superior in just about every respect.BrightVibrant colorsGood viewing anglesNo discernable bleed on dark screensNo necessary adjustments to get good PQ / colors right out of the box (auto mode)No dead or stuck pixelsUniform screen imageCrisp / sharp textDeep black levelsLED backlightingPower Efficient (uses about half the power then some other models I was considering)Display-PortThe VE278Q is a pleasure to use and I would recommend it for general use to anyone in the market for such a monitor. Just get it, your eyes will thank you later.","Cons:As with other ASUS models and as has already been pointed out by other users, the stand on the VE278Q does the job but does leave something to be desired. On my unit the stand actually has the monitor leaning ever so slightly to the left. Many people might not pick up on this but I have a level shelf in the background that highlights this oddity. Its something you have to look for to see though so no big deal.  Also the stand tends to allow the monitor to wobble a little when adjusting the setting or turning on / off the power.If you want a 6x Eyefinty setup the buttons are on the bottom of the right side which would prevent truly flush placement. Again not a big deal IMO.","Other Thoughts:I was considering the HP 2710m, LG M2762D-PM , Samsung P2770HD, Samsung P2770H, Hanns-G HZ281HPB and a few others but I have no doubt that I made the right choice.

ASUS,VE248H,5,Beautiful,2010-10-18,"Pros:LED backlighting currently the most energy efficent form of backlighting avaiable to LCDs.27 Inches, makes my old 22 inch monitor seem tiny.Good options. Some people said they needed to adjust the color/settings alot. All i did was have to adjust my brightness/saturation. All colors seem fine (R/G/B/B&W).",Cons:not 120 hertz.,"Other Thoughts:Bought this after waiting 2 weeks to see if any other company would release a 27 IN LED LCD, none other have. Was also nervous with the lack of reviews online about the product.Bought it anyway. Do not regret a thing. This is monitor is beautiful simply beautiful. The colors are vibrant, the image quality is great.I own 22 inch 4 year old Asus 22 inch, and 1 year old Samsung 22 inch. Negating the size difference the image quality is no comparison. Even my Girlfriend who has no tech knowledge has been blown away by the difference.The picture in picture at first i thought was going to be an unused option. After 1 week I plugged an HDMI from my cable box to the monitor. Kinda fun to be browsing the web and having hi def tv in the corner of your screen.If you are concerned don't be, this monitor should meet your expectations.",0,0

Rich, vibrant and deep blacks exemplify this model. The presets, which usually are rubbish actually work decently. This LCD is also very thin, and light weight. Couldn't ask for a better priced LCD on the market. I like the non glossy screen, haven't had any glare issues yet.",Cons:No included HDMI cable.,Other Thoughts:Three of these would make an amazing setup with the right card.,0,0
ASUS,VE248H,3,Pretty Good.,2010-10-14,"Pros:Beautiful vibrant colors, and so much desktop space.  I'm upgrading from an older 17"" LCD, and this monitor just blows my previous one out of the water.  I didn't know my games could look so good.Very bright, and you gotta love the HD capability.  Widescreen, where have you been all my life?  I love not having black borders on the top and bottom of the screen all the time.","Cons:Ghosting!!  Ugh...I've never really experienced this issue so blatantly before.  The monitor is supposed to be 2ms GTG, yet on any white or gray screen, i can see that my mouse pointer has a very distinguishable trail behind it.  This is very unfortunate because a lot of websites out there are white, and the menu bar at the top of my browser is gray, so all day I'm seeing this little ghost trying to catch up to my pointer.  I don't even have to move the pointer with any kind of speed before the ghost appears.I can even notice ghosting of my pointer on just about any color of screen.  Going into MS Paint and filling the screen with color, I get ghosting on most colors.  It seems that the lighter the color, the more it ghosts, however, as I get zero ghosting on a black screen, and very little on a dark blue or red, but i get massive ghosting on white, yellow, and lighter gray","Other Thoughts:While I do love this monitor for most of its merits (LED lighting, massive desktop space, vibrant bright colors, and HD capability), the ghosting issues I'm having really detract from my experience, and really make me consider returning this monitor for a different one.",1,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing,2010-10-14,Pros:I have it plugged into an Geforce 8800 GT and its amazing looking. Very bright colors. The 1920 x 1080 resolution provides a ton of desktop space. A great buy for the price.,Cons:None so far,"Other Thoughts:The speakers could stand to be a little bit louder, their not bad, I just have roommates that likes to watch movies kinda loud. The menu system takes a minute to figure out, also took bit to find the volume controls. Going to get a Geforce GTX 460 soon so I can really push the 1080p aspect in games.",0,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,Has it all,2010-10-14,"Pros:This thing runs cool as a cucumber, no heat at all after hours' use.  Plenty bright, black blacks, lots of real estate at 24"" - big enough you won't want to get too close.  Mountable and lightweight.  Buttons feel like they'll last.  No pixel problems.  The chassis border is pretty thin so multi-monitor setups should be fine.  You can plug a console right in, no reason to keep my TV.  Some people might find a use for the speakers, but we all know what 2w speakers can't do.  If you're coming from anything more than a year old you'll be generally impressed.","Cons:You'll have to play with the settings, but that's always the case.  About 60% as bright as my 120hz laptop screen (glare type) but the view angles+size easily make up for that.  And the hdmi cable? What hdmi cable?  I'm not a big fan of glossy plastic hardware, but that's just preferential.","Other Thoughts:This is a great option that kicks the snot out of cheaper monitors.  Great stats, a brand that supports its products + it's mountable.  With current tech the only reason not to buy is if you're holding out for 120hz, all of which still have major cons imo.  Got here fast as always, CA kills me with their taxes tho",10,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Superb Display,2010-10-12,"Pros:The display is gorgeous. The image is bright and clear with the LED backlight. Having 2ms response time, Full HD, LED backlighting and a slim bezel for only $215 makes this a spectacular buy. This package throws everything into the mix that the VH24 customer service award model has and adds the LED backlight. I usually prefer glossy screens since they seem to have better blacks, but this is a flat finish, and it's blacks are darker than my glossy samsung LCD 42"" TV. Very good picture.",Cons:None. Would love to see a 120hz in this model down the road though.,"Other Thoughts:I plan on running triple monitors and wanted a nice monitor that didn't cose $300+ like the current LED or 120hz models. I bought this one as a test before buying 2 more, and I am going to buy 2 more right away and run these as a triple display.",15,0

It's a big difference over a 24"" monitor running the same resolution.- Large screen, obviously! >30% larger than a 23.6"" display.- Energy efficiency is superb.- No ghosting in Counterstrike, can't speak for other FPS games.- Starcraft 2 in 1080p with all settings on ultra and getting 100fps is WOWing on this monitor.- Standard LCD viewing angle.- No backlight bleed.- Plethora of inputs! -Display port, HDMI, DVI, and VGA.","Cons:- Most of the Splendid modes are terrible.  They are vibrant to an extreme degree.  Say goodbye to white saturation if you use Scenery or Theater mode.  Most of the calibration tests I performed severely disliked these two settings.  I watched a 1080p movie with my custom configuration and it looked amazing, so the Theater setting seems obsolete for the inexperienced.- Gamma is off out of the box, today's industry standard is 2.2 (although I think Apple uses 1.8?)  Luckily this is easily calibrated via third party software for graphics cards.- Shiny finish looks amazing for a day and then becomes a fingerprint and dust magnet.","Other Thoughts:I calibrated this monitor using multiple LCD calibration tests and monitor diagnostics, both online and with programs, to find the ""sweet spot"" configuration.

It looks great and costs the same or less than other 27inch LCD screens.Unless 15 minutes of your time is worth the money you save in not buying an APPLE display, quit complaining about setting it up so that it fits your idea of what looks good, isn't that part of making something your own, Setting your viewing preferences.",Other Thoughts:AMAZING PICTUREGreat PRICE,0,0

ASUS,VE248H,5,Fantastic,2010-10-08,"Pros:Bright whites, dark blacks, vivid colors.  I bought this without seeing any reviews and I am so glad I took the chance it's amazing how great this monitor is versus the 27"" veiwsonic I have sitting next to it.","Cons:Controls are a bit odd, just my opinion.  Certainly NOT something to really consider since you get used to them pretty quick.Hitting the control buttons will wobble the screen.  However the stand seems very stable aside from that unless you have a fisher price style desk.  But if that's the case it's your desk not the monitor that's at fault.  Again not something to really detract from the monitor.","Other Thoughts:Hands down worth buying, if you're going from a 22"" or smaller this thing will amaze you.Please be sure to know how to adjust your video settings.  Nvidia card users who go with HDMI note you'll not want to use RGB in the nvidia control panel or your blacks will look washed out.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,4,Great for the money,2010-10-07,Pros:Amazing clarity. Vibrant colors. Nice and bright without being blinding. Worked out of the box with no driver installation or extra setup (Win 7 Pro).,"Cons:Not a major complaint considering the price but the viewing angle is very unforgiving. You have perhaps a 3-4 degree range in any direction before the color shifts towards yellow. Unless you're constantly viewing the screen from multiple angles, the is almost unnoticeable but worth noting.","Other Thoughts:Replaced both of my 19"" LCD's with 2 of these monitors and was instantly impressed. Didn't test the speakers so I can't vouch for their quality as I prefer ""real"" speakers. Definitely worth the money if you're looking for quality LED monitor.",3,0

For almost 400 dollars, they should AT LEAST include an HDMI cable.  It has weird color settings compared to my old 28 inch that broke before this.  It feels heavy on blue, which means that it produces weird shades of red or black sometimes, as if they're too dark or purplish.  The contrast feels difficult to get right.",Other Thoughts:I have to give props to Asus for being the only company willing to put out a LED monitor of this size this year and have it look pretty good.  4 stars for not including an HDMI cable and the poor shades of red.,2,4

ASUS,VE248H,5,Amazing!!!,2010-09-17,Pros:Great contrast ratio and as we all know that's the foundation of a great picture!! It arrived yesterday from The Egg with no damage and all pixel working. hooked everything up and WOW!!! So I tried a few movies that I usually use to test tv's and projectors and again WOW. Avatar looked more colorful and detailed on any other display in my house. So I tried AVP-R because it was one of the darkest movies I owned and was amazed at how much detail I was missing so this monitor gets 5 Eggs from me!!,"Cons:Not really a con but does need to be said. All displays are going to need some adjustment, every room is different and everyones needs are also..","Other Thoughts:Ordering 2 more next week for 3 screen gaming, YEAH!! Since it has only been a day I'll keep you posted if in problems should arise.",1,0
ASUS,VE248H,5,I like it,2010-09-14,"Pros:I bought two of these monitors to replace my aging CRT's and clarity is amazing. The colors are extremely vivid and the contrast is much better than I was expecting for a LCD monitor, impressive black to white ratio.","Cons:Non so far, may change later.",Other Thoughts:I picked these up because they were on sale and they are LED back-lit and low energy consumption. for the money they are very good units and I would recommend them to others.,1,1
