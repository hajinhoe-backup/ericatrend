GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Amazing device,2019-03-06,"Pros:- 144hz Panel- Long battery life- 6 Core CPU w/ GTX 1060 (fast)- RGB Keyboard- THIN bezels- Sleek, Thin and Light Design- Doesn't SCREAM gamer",Cons:- It has quite the chin- Single channel RAM- Camera on the bottom- No skins for this device :(,"Other Thoughts:The AERO 15 is an amazing device. Its perfect for me as I am a student that is majoring in 3D Animation so the load that this computer will be able to handle is perfect for 3D programs and I have the necessary battery life to get me through my other classes for the whole day. Even if you have to bring the charging cable (probably won't), the block is really thin and small so it's not even that bad. This laptop is really just the perfect fit for me. Productivity with the capability for gaming on the side! The camera on the bottom does kind of blow but to be honest, I never use the camera so it doesn't bother me at all. The keyboard is really tactile and you have to press hard to have it register, but I like my keyboards like that so it's fine for me. Overall an awesome device with a variety of capabilities. 10/10 would highly recommend.p.s. going from 60hz to 144hz is literally the biggest change you'll ever witness. It's so buttery and smooth.",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Amazing machine with a few caveats.,2019-02-17,"Pros:-An amazing all around laptop.-Good for light Tasks, or hardcore gaming.-Quiet when you want it to be.-Beautiful screen.-It does everything I bought it for","Cons:When you first get the laptop there is some setup required to get it to run in its optimal state.What I did:- Undervolted the CPU (necessary to keep temps down and make machine run properly)-installed dual channel RAM (not completely necessary but also helps performance)-installed another terabyte of storage (again not necessary but is nice to have since it only comes with 500gb)Other Cons:GIGABYTE PLEASE FIX YOUR KEYBOARDS- the ""o"" key takes much more effort than necessary to activate)- the ""k"" key also sometimes requires more force-Best of all my right arrow key really does not lie to stay attached to my keyboard","Other Thoughts:Overall, I love this laptop. It does everything I bought it to do and doesn't give me any fuss in return.I would recommend this laptop to others but I would tell them to make sure they knew what they were getting into t set it up correctly. (doing all the updates, undervolting CPU, installing new ram and storage) there are many laptops taking this niche corner of the laptop market.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Fantastic Laptop with minor issues,2019-02-16,Pros:- Great specs for the price- Fantastic build quality compared to similar laptops- Great speakers for a thin and light- incredible battery life- Beautiful screen,"Cons:- Pretty bad touch pad, however, with some tinkering and installation of Windows Precision Drivers, can make it *almost* perfect- Keyboard feels good, yet the actuation pressure is almost a little too high for my taste, tend to miss a few keys when typing","Other Thoughts:- I would heavily recommend this product to anyone looking to either use it for gaming on the go, or professionally for their career.  Only things that would make this review five stars would be a slightly lighter keyboard, Windows Precision Drivers out of the box, and really, that's it.  Awesome laptop!",0,0

If you game anything competitively this will give you a big edge. If you don't its still marvelous to watch how smooth you cruise across the screen.,Cons:Only complaint would be ELAN touchpad drivers. Theyre just not as responsive and smooth as windows precision drivers.,Other Thoughts:Power and performance without the EXTREME GAMER CRIMSON AND BLACK tag. That sold me.,1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Almost the perfect laptop,2019-02-03,"Pros:-Battery life is amazing when setup correctly. I can get around 6-7 hours during heavy HD youtube streaming.-Performance in most AAA games is smooth at high settings, some even going as high as the 144hz refresh rate allows-NVME SSD compatible is a huge plus. I wish it came with an nvme drive to start but it was way too easy to add a new one that I just decided to buy my own and use the included drive as a semi fast external backup drive.-Size matters and this little guy does its job and can stay relatively cool considering the power inside, but in a very small form factor.-USB C port is always a plus-Keyboard can be a little stiff at first but when you get acquainted to the required pressure it takes, the keys are a treat to type on.-The display is as I expect an IPS display to be. Correct colors with the pantone certification and very adaptable to users who prefer blue light filters. I keep my blue light setting around the mid level.-one more huge benefit is the laptop is completely user serviceable. The memory, hard drive, network card, and cooling unit are all easily accessible after removing the back panel. Kudos to Gigabyte for doing this, as well as adding a HUGE battery.","Cons:-I needed to reinstall windows to get everything to work correctly. Not that it didn't ""work"" out of the box, but seemingly some of the included software slowed things down. This was remedied by windows clean installation. Performance shot up dramatically after doing this.-No infinite scroll in the included firmware.-Not a very fast included SATA m,2 drive.","Other Thoughts:I would not hesitate to recommend this laptop to any of my tech capable friends, however I feel that if you are not a power user or someone familiar with managing your own software installation then this laptop may be a little more tricky to get working as intended.",2,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Great first experience,2019-01-23,Pros:A great premium look that does not sacrifice performance. I ran a large number of programs at once with no issues and the thunderbolt port is a very welcome addition. One other main reason I chose this laptop is because it still includes an SD Card reader which many newer generation laptops have chosen to omit.,Cons:The material on the laptop can smudge a little easily but is a non-issue with proper cleaning.,,0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Good hardware with questionable Software,2019-01-12,Pros:- 144hz Screen- full keyboard- awesome battery life,Cons:- The Gigabyte Smart-manager software is terrible. when tabbing through open applications you'll see a GBSOD window that you cannot close or you will no longer be able to use the function keys to control the brightness. How Gigabyte doesn't have this running as a service is beyond me.- Elan Touch-pad software leaves a lot to be desired. Luckily you can install different drivers that allow windows precision touch-pad gestures.- I had some terrible lag on the windows installation that came with the system and had to re-image the machine with the Microsoft tool.- BIOS is very limited,Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this products to other even with its cons. One other upgrade I would recommend is an NVME drive as the drive that comes with the PC is just a SATA m.2 and has pretty slow read/write speeds.,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,So far so good,2019-01-10,"Pros:-battery life appears to be as advertised-ran the steam VR checker. Scored high to extreme. Very happy about this, HTC VIVE will be in next week.","Cons:I purchased an open box version of this laptop and was a little worried about their disclaimers and if this would come with a power cord. I was pleased to find that everything was there as if it were new, it had just been opened once before. I then discovered why the previous person returned the laptop. The A key didn't click down right. it still worked, just didn't feel right. I popped it off and found that for some reason there was a glob of glue on the underside of the key, so i cut it off, put the key back on, and it works perfectly now.",,1,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Love this Laptop,2018-12-27,"Pros:I bought this for my wife for Christmas. She does a lot of productivity type work and some gaming. I've been really impressed so far. Specific standouts are- Premium build quality- Tuned fans for quiet operation, only ramping up when needed- She has longer nails and really likes the typing experience. It's large enough to keep from mistyping- The display is bright and very clear. A big help with her photo editing (online selling, not photography type work)",Cons:- Lots of updates out of the box. Took almost two hours to get up and going.- Disable trackpad setting wont stay disabled. I think it's a Windows update thing though,"Other Thoughts:I highly recommend this laptop for someone who does a mix of productivity and gaming. It wont run everything on ultra, and the fans are loud, but it's a laptop and minimizes compromise while giving a nice, enjoyable experience.",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Great Upgrade,2018-12-24,"Pros:I bought this during a sale, and I am happy with its performance.The laptop is fairly lightweight, has a long battery life, and good color definition on the screen. It works great for what I need it to do","Cons:Fans are a bit loud, but there’s not much that can be done to help that in a laptop this thin",,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,"Great, but can be better",2018-12-24,"Pros:Hardware:-Screen is really good for its color.-Thin, light compared to others in gaming laptop category.-Well built. Good quality hardware.Software:-Smart manager and smart update helped me a lot.-With a i7-8750h you should expect a good performance in processing work.-512GB SSB is sufficient for most people. And you can add one if you want to.","Cons:-Single ram limits gaming experience when you want more fps (>100). For some cpu and gpu intense games fps drops significantly (20%), according to YouTube channels.-Camera that makes your nose so big.-Needs to tune your system yourself in order to make this system stable. But after that everything is perfect.","Other Thoughts:Since I wanted to buy one more 16gb of ram kit and searched through forum, it is somehow disappointing to see that even for manufacturer validated models there are still crashes or issues. This is a bad thing I find unsatisfying.But, if you don't play cpu-intense games, that's totally fine and this laptop has great performance on work.You can set to different modes to fit your current work load. For games, set to high performance and the fan will be really noisy. For long battery life, set to power saver and frequency of CPU will be down to some 2000MHz. According to smart manager, it can last for 10 hours for web viewing.In conclusion, after buying such a premium level laptop the first time, I think the best choice is a lightweight (some 1kg laptop)+ 1 desktop for performance. But if you can only get one, just get this. Everything (software and hardware) is well made (except single ram) It is definitely the bang for the buck.Update:When I add a ram kit for aero15w, this guy becomes a real beast.For your reference, in csgo, I set graphics to low in 1080p, and set fps_menu_max 300.When it was equipped with only 1ram (The original one from Kingston), fps was some  180 at most.When it was equipped with 2 rams (1 Kingston 1 Crucial  CT16G4SFD8266 from newegg), fps goes to 270.Note: For cpu intense games, adding a ram really works.Why are you doing this to me, Gigabyte, why not dual ram?  This is a premium laptop and you should place it with 8gbx2 ram kits, which best releases the performance this model can get..",1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Sleek and powerful,2018-12-23,"Pros:The specs of the computer are really good. Games run really fast and the 144Hz monitor makes a big difference. Most high-end games run 60+ FPS and medium-requirement games run above 100.No slowdown when running multiple programs/tabs at the same time.The keyboard is really nice to type on and is responsive, requires just the right amount of pressure.","Cons:Camera placement is not ideal, it is on the bottom of the screen.Sometimes there is a little delay between opening tabs and programs that does not actually slow anything down but looks a little jumpy.","Other Thoughts:Very good laptop overall, if you can spare a little extra I would recommend the 15X with the GTX 1070 for a noticable increase in graphical processing speed, but if you'd rather save a few hundred $, this is a very good choice.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,"powerful, portable, mediocre cooling",2018-12-09,"Pros:-144hz ips display is gorgeous to look at-i7 8750h & gtx 1060 are more than enough to run most esports titles at over 144 fps to take advantage of the 144hz screen-battery is LARGE at 94wh, battery life is amazing for a laptop of those specs ( about 7-8 hours of web browsing and light tasks at 25% brightness and balanced battery performance mode)-keyboard has a nice feeling to it-amazing selection of ports-1 extra nvme slot and 1 memory slot-very portable for the power that it houses",Cons:- out of the box experience was not good a lot of bloat wares and lagg( can be fixed with reinstalling windows and updating everything from drivers to windows)-comes with single channel memory out of the box-camera position,Other Thoughts:-i recommend adding another ram stick to enable dual channel memory ( careful not to add unsupported memory gigabyte-track pad has good feel to it but has bad drivershave a list of supported memory look it up)other than that the laptop is even more than i coulda have asked for great for gaming and class combining both battery life and performance,1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,3,Great attempt but so many flaws,2018-12-04,Pros:- Battery Life- Trackpad (after upgrading to Windows Precision Drivers)- Performance (after extensive tweaks)- Screen (both colors and 144hz capability)- Build Quality,"Cons:- Square edges are uncomfortable for typing- Keyboard strokes are nice, recessed keys - not so much- Optimus is terrible- Lengthy setup- A lot of bloat","Other Thoughts:*** UPDATE ***After extensive research on the issues discussed both under ""cons"" and below, I decided to do a full SSD Format and Windows reinstall. This remedied all software related issues, and the machine runs absolutely perfect.The unfortunate part of the aforementioned resolution is that it seems nearly all people must do this to get the performance out of their machine that is originally described, otherwise you're left with a very sub-par and disappointing laptop.I still don't like the keyboard placement at all, nor the fact that 9 times out of ten I miss the 'e' keystroke, but I believe with more time on the keyboard, I will be able to get used to this nuance.--- Original Review ---I don't think I can keep this pc. The keyboard is nice to type on, however, it requires a strong keystroke deliberately down the middle of the key. Otherwise, it misses the keystroke entirely. The keys are also recessed into the chassis slightly, causing them to be more difficult to press than usual, due to the odd angle they place your hands. The RGB feature is actually something I found very nice and easy to control, after you download and install the application. Granted, I set them to white while working, however, setting the keyboard to random RGB functions actually helps accentuate a room in subtle way that I wouldn't have expected.The edges of the laptop are square, and very sharp. It is aesthetically appealing, however, extremely uncomfortable to type on for long durations. It is equally uncomfortable to game on, as the edges feel as though they dig into your skin.The screen is absolutely amazing, however. Everything is crisp and clear, the 144hz monitor is absolutely a huge leap ahead of normal 60hz versions, and the colors are great. With that said, optimus causes your machine to hiccup every time you open a window so it can decide which GPU to use. This is beyond frustrating. To make matters worse, you cannot disable Optimus or the iGPU, so you're stuck living with this delay every time you open a new application. I've also not figured out how to enable the nVidia GPu without going into the control panel and setting it to run for specific applications, which is another annoyance that one should not have to deal with.The trackpad feels nice and is accurate, however, it is imperative to switch from ELAN to Windows Precision drivers, as you lose out on many gestures and the trackpad becomes even more accurate once you've doneso.All-in-all, for all the great reviews this laptop has received by reviewers, I have to admit I am extremely disappointed with the machine. While the performance is good, once you make the ncessary changes, I feel  you should not be required to spend 5-8 hours to set up a laptop to work properly out-of-the-box, which is exactly what I did.Overall, for many people, this machine would likely be a wonderful and long-lasting laptop. The entire laptop is made of quality products, from its aluminum chassis to the excellent glass trackpad and nice keyboard feel. The drawbacks mentioned earlier cause this machine to not be suitable for a daily business laptop that would also be used for gaming on the side, unfortunately.",1,2
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Great performance!,2018-12-03,Pros:- Great bezel-less display- Keyboard is very satisfying to type on-Performs great in the games I have tested- Startup speed is fast,Cons:- Gets very hot to the touch while under high load- You must have the power cord plugged in while gaming or else it will remain locked at 30 fps,Other Thoughts:- Would definitely recommend for your average pc gamer,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,So far so good,2018-11-26,Pros:- Screen looks wonderful!- Extra NVME slot (I added a Samsung 970)- I really like the keyboard... My favorite so far on a laptop- Battery life has been good for me so far- CPU and GPU are great for my needs,Cons:- Sata SSD isnt great- The fans can get loud under load- It has a bit of coil whine- This is definitely not the best track pad I have used on a Laptop (but I use a mouse anyway),"Other Thoughts:Over all I am pleased with this laptop so far. Much smaller, lighter, and better looking then the clunky laptop I had before. It isn't perfect but still really good for what I paid (I got it for $300 off).

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Built like a tank / All day battery / Powerhouse,2018-11-21,"Pros:- The overall build quality on this machine is impressive. I have owned many high end laptops and this one impresses out of the box- Size and compactness in comparison with the level of components is amazing- Battery life is worthy of a standing ovation. I am glad someone listened and answered the call for a larger battery- Key travel is nice, keys well lit and number pad is in the right spot- RGB lighting on the keyboard is beautiful- PLENTY of connections for everything you need.",Cons:- Speakers are awful. I understand they had to cut corners somewhere and this was obviously the spot- Lots of unwanted programs on initial boot to deal with. I recommend a clean install of OS,"Other Thoughts:I have read the reviews and complaints on this machine but I don't have anything negative to say. This is an excellent machine at a price point that rivals others within this field. I chose this over the MSI because of build quality issues on previous machines I have owned and I am not disappointed. The Aero is simply beautiful and the build is top shelf. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a powerhouse in a small form factor. This fits perfect in my 14"" laptop backpack and I could not be more thrilled.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Affordable entry into portable gaming,2018-11-17,"Pros:+ Keyboard with numpad. The typing experience is nice. Coming from a lenovo I was worried that typing would be difficult due to my love of that keyboard, but the keyboard is nicely laid out and the keys have a nice travel. No complaints+ Set up. I did not notice much bloatware on my set up and did not overly feel that I would need a fresh reinstall of windows+ Battery. 94 watt hours is great for an all day laptop with no need to bring the charger+ price per performance. The 1060 is right in my sweet spot for 1080 gaming, especially with the 144 hz refresh+ build quality","Cons:- I really wish the SSD was nVme, rather than sata. It already has the slot on the motherboard, so it can be done on the motherboard. I understand this probably keeps the price down, but would have been a very nice addition.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this laptop to people that are content with having a little more weight t carry to have an all day battery and solid gaming experience. I love that the laptop has a more muted decor, which allows me to use this at work without worrying about getting weird looks.",1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,"Long Battery Life, Great Performance!",2018-11-12,Pros:- Thin and light design- Aluminum Body- Very long battery for college usage- 144hz panel that makes gaming and productivity smooth and crisp- Second M.2 slot for hard drive expansion- Full size Ethernet portOverall great laptop to carry around to class then game on the go.,Cons:- Bloatware on installation slows down computer- Nvidia Optimus causes mouse to freeze when opening applications (known issue across many laptops),"Other Thoughts:Best advise and what I did is reformat Windows entirely and only install exactly what software you want. There is not a large amount of bloatware which I am very happy with but there is some unnecessary stuff that could be removed. I did end up replacing the trackpad drivers with some different ones which made the trackpad almost perfect. With optimus there are some known issues with mouse cursor freezing when opening programs, but this is a known issue across many computers using optimus, but this is the only way to achieve the ridiculously long battery life. While on intel graphics I can get more than a day of school work done, but then on gaming I just leave it plugged in to game and it performs great. Coming from a 15"" Macbook Pro I was worried about battery life and that is what made me buy this laptop. Overall very happy with the gigabyte laptop.- I give 4 out of 5 eggs because of some minor things that bothered me at first, but I feel as if that is coming from the quality and seamless graphic switching of Apple previously. Overall fantastic though!",1,0

It's good battery life makes it very mobile which allows me to work on my building's terrace for example without any problems.",Cons:Just like with any non custom build it takes a while to set up according to your liking. I haven't encountered any downsides besides that I think the 15X without the orange arrow looks a bit more sleek.,Other Thoughts:Can be pricey but if it is your daily driver and you're dependant on a solid machine the quality is definitely worth paying for.,1,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Very well designed and balanced,2018-08-14,"Pros:- The battery last for hours and charges in about 2h.- The 144hz screen is perfect for gaming so you don't lose any frame on games such as Overwatch and CS GO.- The aesthetic of the laptop is insuperable, I really like how they have designed the laptop to get the maximum of the screen and keyboard.","Cons:- A little bit heavy, but It is understandable with a 1060 inside the computer.- The touch pad freezes sometimes, but If you buy this computer I am sure you will have a mouse ready for playing and wont notice this minor detail.",,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,"Great device specially if you hate ""Gamer laptop design""",2018-08-02,"Pros:New i7 8th generation is great, paired with the gtx1060 is really nice. The screen is just amazing, if you're coming from Mac like me and usually hate the other laptop screens this one is pretty great, bezelless, pantone certified, 144hz, just worth every penny. What made me fall in love with this one is the aesthetics, they aren't gamerish at all, and that's good for me because I hate that black/red stuff. It feels sturdy everywhere but the screen, it's more wobbly than usual but you're supposed to touch the screen to just open and close it, right? So not much of an issue. The battery is almost as good as advertised, it really lasts like 5 hours on average. Overall I think it's a great laptop.","Cons:The keyboard takes some getting used to, I love it visually (The individual RGB is great for learning new hotkeys in programs, that I love) but you need a little more force than usual and some other users report keys repeating, I haven't experienced that. It's HOT literally and figuratively, I've not seen any throttling as some people say, but it does get hot, not where you rest your hands though. The AC adapter is kind of noisy when it's at full capacity, and I got scared at first, I'm waiting to hear from Gigabyte to see if that's normal. Elan driver trackpad kind of sucks, the feel is pretty nice, but meh I usually use it with a mouse.","Other Thoughts:Recommended to former Mac users, also to people who wishes to play games also do some creative work. Not the best bang for the buck but if you're like me and care about how it looks, well this one's for you.",3,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,4,Beautiful computer with some minor inconveniences,2018-06-21,"Pros:This laptop feels very well built, the screen is gorgeous to look at, and the hardware is top notch. It just feels like a very premium device, there's no other way to describe it. The keyboard is very pleasant to type on (much better than my last year XPS 15) and the RGB lighting on it is fun to play with, if you're into that. The battery life is what I'd consider good, but falls a bit short of the 8 hours I expected, averaging about 6 for me. I've installed Arch Linux onto this laptop, and after alot of fiddling (more on that later) it works like a charm.  The laptop temperatures never went above 90 degrees, and for a laptop of this size I think that's great.","Cons:Installing Linux onto this computer was a chore that took about a week for me to get through. First, there's the issue of the laptop freezing randomly (especially when querying for PCIe devices) unless a certain kernel parameter was set. Then, setting up bumblebee and bbswitch was filled with trial and error, albeit it was my first time setting it up, so maybe it wasn't the computers fault. The FN keys don't get recognized in Linux, so I am forced to use a software solution for changing brightness and sound.While the keyboard generally is very pleasant to type on, the 'X' key requires a lot more force to press at times. I've somewhat got used to this, but this is the issue that takes this laptop from 5 eggs to 4 for me. Emacs users beware.Finally, the RGB on the right Shift key is very bad/weak. I really couldn't care less, but some people might be bothered by it.","Other Thoughts:This is a beautiful laptop with an amazing screen and great internals. It's both rugged and sleek at the same time, and that's what I love about it. If the 'X' key worked properly, this would be the perfect laptop for me.",1,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP,5,Way better the second time!!!!,2018-05-08,Pros:Very nice screenBlazing fast processorGreat battery line - 6-9 hrs depending on what i am doing.Keyboard is nice once you get use to it.Nice keyboard lightingVery customize-able,"Cons:Sata M.2 drive with purchaseInitial setup was painful.There is backlight bleed, but I dont care after im into windows.Factory install is horrible!!!Single channel memory.Smart update is painfully slow!!!","Other Thoughts:So i purchased an nvme drive and a stick of 2666 mhz memory.  Install both, and after initial setup and clone.  System of still unstable or had its quirks.  So i started all over and installed a fresh copy of window along with drives and software from website waiting til the end to install intel HD drivers first and then nvidia drivers and everything went perfect.  After that the laptop has worked flawlessly.  It is true that if you do a clean install everything works as it should.  Love the laptop especially the battery life.  Right now I am writing this review with a full battery surfing the web and I am at 8 hr 41 mins.  I do a lot of flash based games and I still get 7 hrs of battery life.  The 1060 is only 10-15% slower in SOME games but it works buttery smooth on games like doom and starcraft and racing games.  I highly recommend this laptop and coming from a person that gets a laptop almost every year, this one maybe a keeper this time.  I am very happy with it after the clean install.  On another note all touchpad issues were fixed once the clean install was done.  I did have issues before that, stuttering and hang but these were eliminated after clean install.  Hope this helps.  Dont let the backlight bleed or touchpad issues sway you.  Get this laptop do a clean install and it will be the best laptop you have ever owned.",3,0
Acer,E5-571-5552,3,Good laptop unless you have to change a component,2016-05-26,"Pros:Good performance, excellent battery life.",Cons:I decided to put in a SSD to replace the HDD.  What a nightmare.

I think if the SSD part dies, it probably kills it.  The only mechanical disk failures I've had in laptops have been mechanical and thermal abuse by my kids.Looks like you need to crack the case to replace the disk drive.

Its the first time I have regretted a laptop purchase.I hate Windows 8. I have trouble finding programs, I hate maneuvering between screens, and I hate the pop up tool bars (or whatever they are called). Maybe I am too old (43), but I simply do not understand how to navigate through Windows 8. It seems Windows 8 is only interested in running apps, but all I want to do is have easy access to a few programs.The laptop came pre-installed with many apps or programs that I have absolutely no use for or no understanding what their purpose is.I hate the touch pad. There is no true left/right click buttons, and I often have trouble using the left/right clicks. The pad does not have the scroll capability that other touch pads had. I bought a wireless mouse to make navigating easier, adding $20 to the cost of the laptop.No matter process I attempt. the computer pauses before executing every command. I am not running games or big programs. Just surfing web, writing email, and listening to music. There is a delay even when opening a file folder.I did not read the description carefully; I did not notice that this machine does not have a DVD drive. This is a problem because I still have many older programs on disc. I had to buy an external drive, adding another $20 to the cost. Now suddenly this inexpensive machine is not so inexpensive.Its a small gripe, but the numbers lock does not stay locked when the laptop goes to sleep.",0,0

It's low, but I knew what I was getting. It's the fact that Acer seems to have invented a time machine and purchased the displays from 1998.

Adding memory involves reassembly of nearly the entire device including removing the keyboard, hard drive, fan, wireless and antenna.  This is very inconvenient, but admittedly; doable, if it were not for needing to remove the cable for the USB slots that is 'strapped' over the HDD for some reason, and removing the cables connecting the keyboard and touchpad to the motherboard.  Reconnecting these three cables took me over an hour, and I am typically proficient at this, on account of the feed the cable into the connector on the MB and while holding the keyboard over the chassis reinsert a tiny little clip which can barely be handled in order to resecure the connection.   Adding a 8GB memory DIMM required more than an hour of very frustrating work.  Luckily everything worked when I put it back together or I guess I'd have had to just scrap this thing, having voided the warranty.",Other Thoughts:Consider purchasing a different machine if you have plans to upgrade the memory or hard drive.,1,0

Acer,E5-571-5552,4,"Cheap, but sorely needs a SSD. Only buy if you plan on modding.",2015-07-11,"Pros:Great for what it is. It's a solid laptop that has everything you could ever want... except a SSD, and maybe some more RAM (although it has an empty memory slot just begging to be filled). The processor is pretty solid. The computer doesn't run hot. It's pretty thin, lightweight, and looks sleek. If you just buy a SSD separately, this computer ends up being incredibly cheap for what it is and you end up saving lots of money.","Cons:First of all, tons of bloatware.Second of all, the screen is low res. I'm moving from a 1600x900 to this, which is 1366x768, and it's a bit upsetting. Oh well, you get what you pay for.Third of all, this computer is pretty bad if you don't plan on modding it. I ordered this for rush delivery but let my SSD take its time in the mail. With the HDD that comes with it, this computer is incredibly slow. In this day and age, you really shouldn't be using a 5400 RPM HDD when there are so many better options. Ultimately I opted for a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 256GB.Last but not least, I thought the other reviews were exaggerating but WOW this computer really is not mod friendly! Whoever designed the layout for this computer is truly evil. The hard drive is tricky to access. Adding some RAM... oh boy... it requires literally taking apart the entire computer and unplugging lots of cables. There are 25 screws in total, make sure to keep a bowl nearby to hold the screws so you don't lose any. Overall I think the whole modding process took me about an hour. (just for contrast, it took literally one minute to remove a memory stick from my HP Elitebook).","Other Thoughts:Isn't it funny how that works? The computer demands to be modded, but it's a nightmare to actually mod. At the end of the day I think it was totally worth the time and effort to mod this computer. But this is not for everyone.I'm frugal, I'm dirt poor, but I'm confident in my ability to take apart and reassemble a computer. So this computer is perfect for me: at the end of the day I'm getting a lot of bang for my buck by buying my parts separately, and this laptop makes for a really good base.If you have lots of money or you can't handle the innards of a computer, don't bother with this one. Get something that works better out of the box, or just get something better.",1,0
Acer,E5-571-5552,3,"Some good, some bad",2015-07-09,"Pros:--Great specs for the price. Boots to password screen in about 5 seconds, and gets to desktop in about 10 more secs. Shuts down in a few seconds too.--Seems to hold up to tests. I use Audio/Music software which can be pretty CPU intensive, but I've found no problems so far running many tracks with a medium amount of plug-ins and effects. For Audio folks, please note I'm talking 12-24 audio tracks with medium amount of fx. If you are well above those numbers, I can't comment. But so far, so good.--Design is nice--slick silver/gray look, lightweight, medium slender, though the plastic does feel a bit thin.--A better keyboard than I've seen on similarly priced laptops. The keys have a slightly cheap feel, but I can type quickly, comfortably, and accurately. Number pad is a bonus.--The display is good, though it can go quite dim when not plugged in--I know this is a power save feature, but can sometimes feel a bit too dim. It's quite bright/clear when plugged in.--Speakers are not bad; similar to most laptops I've used--bad bass response et al, but I'm used to that with laptops by now.","Cons:Now the bad:--Mediocre trackpad. It's sloppy, jumpy, sometimes the arrow moves when you try to click, features like zoom almost never work correctly, and 2-finger scroll is often slow to respond and generally choppy. So far, I've found the trackpad to be the most disappointing thing. The one positive of the pad is the 'tap to click' response is nice and sensitive.--Bloatware. I deleted much of what I knew I could safely delete, but there's still a bunch of Acer stuff on there. The comp is still pretty fast, but I know that extra stuff is always a slight drag, plus no one needs that garbage.--I run Linux through a VM-Ware station--it is pretty fast once running, but still has a slight lag, takes a good minute or so to boot up, and does crash once in a while. But it's still preferable to Windows IMO.--This is more about Windows8 than the Acer, but the annoyance of constant updates can be a real pain. Sometimes it's several minutes of updates before you can even boot up and use the machine. As someone used to Linux, I have NOT missed the hassle of Windows.","Other Thoughts:In general, I don't have much experience with a ton of different laptops, so it's not easy to compare. But this is certainly a step down from my other (Sony VAIO). However, it was the specs that sold me. $650 after shipping/tax/all for i7, 8GB RAM, and 1TB HDD is a solid deal, and I shopped around thoroughly before buying. I'm also picky about keyboards (I'm a writer) and though this one is not great by any means, it is noticeably better than probably all I tried in a similar price range. For regular everyday usage (streaming, surfing, etc) I think this is a solid computer for the price. Also, with specs like this, people looking to run music or other CPU-heavy software will probably be satisfied, as I have so far been. The trackpad can be frustrating and unreliable, but I think overall it depends on what you need the machine for.Bottom line--a good, not great, laptop, but with excellent specs for the price, and for those who want speed on a budget, this might be the bargain they have been looking for.",2,1

Acer,E5-571-5552,5,Amazed at price to value,2015-06-20,"Pros:It has a 5th Gen I5 processor at this price point! I got this on sale at $339. I like the size of the keys on the keyboard and the features that this laptop comes with are pretty good for the price. Such as 10/100/1000 Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 5th gen I5, option to add second hard drive.  It can be upgraded but it’s a lot of work. All in all, I can't complain too much.  Now for the cons!","Cons:It’s definitely not made with upgrading in mind. Upgrading the hard drive and ram requires an almost complete disassemble of the laptop!  OS wasn't updated at all. Back-up media is not provided but, it can be easily created. I recommend you do it among the first thing you do upon booting it up.  Resolution is low but it’s as advertised.","Other Thoughts:As stated in my comment in the Con's section - this thing wasn't made with upgrades in mind.  I'd say this is tailored to a non tech savvy consumer who takes what they can get.Upgrading the Hard Drive was the easiest part of the process. The RAM is even worse.  You have to remove all the screws on the bottom. Gently pop the entire top panel off with keyboard and unplug all the cables which is a total of 3 before you completely detach and set aside. The hard drive sits nicely on the bottom right side to the left of the touch pad, and removes with 2 screws. You can do a hard drive upgrade inside of 10 min.  Upgrading the ram requires the laptop be almost entirely be disassembled.  Once the top cover is off the motherboard is held in place by 3 screws and place holders. Detach the Wi-Fi card, remove 3 additional cables off the board, Remove the screws on the board, remove the heat sink and gently slide the board up from the right. The memory slots are in the bottom/middle under the touch pad but facing down.  Slide your memory chips in and reassemble!I added an extra 4GB ram to make a total of 8GB. I also added a Samsung 250 gb 850 EVO drive.  I get true speeds of the SSD - 505mb read/450mb write.  I had the ram laying around from a prior upgrade.  These 2 items make this laptop superb! Best purchase I've made in a while.  Its snappy, and flawless.  I ordered a Hard Drive caddy that would fit in the empty DVD slot which i will be using for a second hard drive.Get it while its on sale!",5,1
Acer,E5-571-5552,5,great bang for buck,2015-06-14,"Pros:Excellent laptop for the money.  The i5 boogies (outruns my older i7), the screen is bright and clear (though low res), wifi is snappy, and it's relatively portable (lightweight and lasts on battery).  The slow hard drive is a crippler.  Watching the different stats in Task Manager, you'll notice the hard drive is the hang up for most activities.I added a matched pair of 2x4GB GSkill sticks (didn't want t risk buying a single 4GB stick that didn't match specs of the stocker)and a 256GB SSD.  The other reviewers are spot on - upgrading this little fellow takes care and patience.  I found a YouTube video of a guy from Germany who performed similar upgrades, and I just followed along.  It wasn't this same model, but the guts were in the same spots under the keyboard.  Unless you're tech savvy and fearless when it comes to this stuff, I would leave it alone or buy one that's easier to crack open.The laptop comes full of Acer bloatware that I removed one-by-one until only the core apps were left.  After Windows updates and miscellaneous tweaking was done, I could tell a difference in response times even with the OEM HDD.  With the RAM and SSD installed, this thing flies.We'll see if this passes the test of time.  My first Acer laptop.  So far so good.","Cons:Details added in PROS.  Low res screen isn't ideal for everyone, pre-loaded software was resource hoggy, and the 5400RPM hard drive was a crutch.  Again, this laptop was not designed to be upgrade friendly.",,3,0
Acer,E5-571-5552,4,Wouldn't buy again,2015-06-11,Pros:Great specs for the money. Nice little basic laptop. Home users don't expect to upgrade it easily.,"Cons:No access panels on back for memory or hard drive. You have to take the whole back off. Since laptops usually have small plastic clips holding them together in addition to the screws this is not a welcome proposition, Spoke to tech support to ask for instructions about taking the back off and they said ""It is upgradeable but you have to take the back off. We don't recommend taking the back off because you can damage it and void the warranty. We don't give instructions because we don't want you to break it. You will have to bring it in to an acer certified tech to get it done."" Ok, so it is not upgradeable really is it. I am a tech and have been for 30 years but taking apart laptops without knowing how they are latched is never a good idea.",Other Thoughts:This is a very inexpensive laptop and for the money it's hard to beat. I would have rather paid $10 more and had it designed better for upgradeability. Injection molding it with access panels would not have been hard. Still it's a great deal for the money.,4,1

After a shutdown, it seems to slow a little on the internet use and windows 8 features.

Multitouch trackpad actually worked better than it did with Windows 8.1 out of the box.  For Windows, make sure you update your drivers!  The trackpad kinda sucks (as mentioned in other reviews) but the latest driver update completely eliminated all issues!  For Linux you will need to go into the BIOS and disable Secure-Boot.  Fairly simple but you will need to set a BIOS password before it will allow you to change this setting (you can disable it when finished).  Once secureboot is disabled everything works great for a dual-boot with no additional changes.",Cons:Secure-Boot is not the easiest thing to disable.  (see pros),Other Thoughts:Great Battery Life!!!

Is it the processor, machine builder (Acer), Intel, or Microsoft?  Who knows?Intel has confounded the consumer to such a degree as to discourage buying anything, Yet they are the reputable name.Same goes for Microsoft whose business was based on a Start menu yet they decided against it with Win 8.1?   Acer tries to make the mess better by piling on their convenience software  The whole user experience suffers.  This machine is made for a person who doesn't mind waiting for the machine to figure out its name at every turn, not for me.  It does what it wants regardless what I want it to do. That is unacceptable. I own it and and it should do my bidding.  Until I buy a different (not-Acer) machine, I'm stuck with it.  Ugh!",0,1

The wireless had connection problems out of the box, and Acer tech support was no help. They had me uninstall and reinstall the wireless driver (uninstall and simply reboot to have it reinstalled), but this did not help. I finally found a post online suggesting to disable the ""power saving feature"" on the wireless adaptor (gee do we really need that?), and this got it working. All that was over a year ago. Thought I was good. However, now my daughter took it to college, and it won't connect at the apartment. All other devices are connecting there with no problem. Pulling my hair out. Acer still no help. Purchased a USB wireless adaptor, which is working. Other con is the goofy touchpad, which has a mind of its own and drove my wife crazy when she would use it. I would tell her to plug in a mouse, but that doesn't work when sitting on the sofa.","Other Thoughts:This was a review of a previous generation Aspire (E1-571-6837), but I'm posting it here because the E5-571-5552 the most similar currently available model.

Must disassemble the laptop to access the HD, RAM, Battery and CPU. No Disc drive.","Other Thoughts:This laptop is a great deal for the money. This dual core Intel Core i5 4210u has good performance. it's as about as fast as my 4 year old Intel  Core i7 840QM that has 4 cores! Amazing how far cpu technology has gotten in just 4 years when a dual core can perform as well as a quad core just a few generations old.The Battery life on this cpu is very good and this laptop comes with a 6 cell battery to boot, where many laptops in this price range only come with a 4 cell battery.The laptop is thin and light weight as well which is always a plus if you use your laptop on the go often.This laptop doesn't come with a Disc drive, but there is a slot to put one in, if you so choose which is nice. I myself, hardly use a disc drive anymore, so it isn't a big deal to me.The only drawback to this laptop is accessing the ram and hard drive if you want to upgrade those or replacing the battery once it dies. In order to upgrade or replace these components, you have to disassemble the laptop to get to those components. But many laptops in this price range seem to be like that. I just looked at a few HPs, Lenovos and Asus laptops  around the same price range as this Acer laptop and those  too had no easy access ports at the bottom panel to get to those components either without having to disassemble them first, which seems like the norm in this price range.All and all it's a good deal. for people just wanting something that is light weight good on battery life and has a  good amount of processing power to handle typical everyday use with ease and then some, for sometime to come.",3,0

Those are adjustments you can make in Windows (and I did).  This a fast machine.  I like the smaller 11 and 12 inch screens but my daughter wanted a bigger one for college.  Its not flimsy.

People complain about the 4GB ram but honestly unused ram is wasted ram, and I use around 1-2GB during normal usage in either windows or linux so I'm not sure what these people are complaining about.  An SSD would've been nice, but obviously it would've ramped up cost a lot.This is not a gaming laptop, but it works fine for older games and maybe some newerish games on low settings.The reason I gave this 5 stars is for the CPU.

Acer,E5-571-5552,3,Don't buy this (UPDATE TO MAYBE BUY THIS),2014-08-02,Pros:Inexpensive (when on sale) and fast for a budget laptop.  The battery is great on this and I often get 7 hours of medium use.  UPDATED went from 1 to 3 stars for an average of 2,"Cons:I can't find a way to edit my old review, so here is an updated one, the wifi issues are not as bad as I initially thought:I wanted to like this laptop, it is cheap for an i5 system but it has some major flaws.  The track pad is so sensitive my wife refuses to use it as she gets mad at it.  I can use it pretty good most of the time without getting too mad at it, but it took a week for me to get to the point I can use it some.  Unlike other trackpads there is no way to adjust the sensitivity of the touch in the driver settings.UPDATED PART: The WIFI may disconnect randomly as you use it, but I figured out it was when my wifi at home was congested.  My other laptops don't have that problem, but I changed a setting on my router and now the wifi on this laptop is stable.  So, beware you may have issues depending on your router settings.   I noticed another reviewer on NewEgg stated they had a wifi problems as well.  I uninstalled the wifi driver, got the very latest and reinstalled but the router changes were the only thing that seemed to help with wifi card. Hopefully you will be ok with your router, but this card is more sensitive than the cards in my other laptops for sure. UPDATED PARTThere is NO easy way to upgrade the ram or HD.  There is no small access panel, and I found a teardown online, this thing has to be almost completely disassembled and the mother board removed to upgrade the RAM.","Other Thoughts:If you get this on a really good sale it may be ok for you.  For me and my wife the biggest issue is the darn trackpad.  It seems like small thing, but my wife can't even get it to scroll with the two finger method and got so mad she won't touch it anymore.   I have 2 other windows 8 laptops, those two are Dell's and I have 2 HP Windows 7 laptops.  And I have no issues with the trackpad on any of those.  You don't realize how useless a laptop is without a good trackpad until you get one that is too touchy or doesn't scroll well.",4,2

The track pad is so sensitive my wife refuses to use it as she gets mad at it.  I can use it pretty good most of the time without getting too mad at it, but it took a week for it to be bearable.  Unlike other trackpads there is no way to adjust the sensitivity of the touch in the driver settings.The WIFI disconnects randomly as you use it, I noticed another reviewer stated they have the exact same problem.  I uninstalled the wifi driver, got the very latest and reinstalled but it still does it.  I also turned off WIFi powerdown settings, which helped a little but it still does it.There is NO easy way to upgrade the ram or HD.  There is no small access panel, and I found a teardown online, this thing has to be almost completely disassembled and the mother board removed to upgrade the RAM.","Other Thoughts:Don't buy this even if it is on sale like when I bought it.  It is really cheap for an I5 system, but the trackpad is awful, the wifi randomly disconnects even if you have the latest driver as of this review 7/27/14, and it is too difficult to upgrade the ram or HD on this model.  I am not a picky person, but I can not recommend this product at any price.  Maybe if they get a better wifi driver someday, but stay away until the reviews get better.",2,1
Acer,E5-571-5552,3,"Good battery, slow, wifi problems",2014-07-19,"Pros:Battery lasts long - about 6 hours on average, which is allows for a few good movies and some web surfing.","Cons:Despite being a i5 Haswell chip, the laptop is rather slow to respond. Perhaps it's the Windows 8.1, or the other pre-installed programs that slow down the computer. Wifi also  automatically disconnects every hour (no other laptop does this in the household). Not sure if a hardware or software problem.",Other Thoughts:Going to re-install my own version of Windows 8 on this laptop to get rid of the additional software.

There are no access doors on the bottom and can find no info on dis-assembly so that the memory can be upgraded.I would also like to eventually upgrade to a SSD drive but looks to be almost impossible to get to the hard drive and memory.,Other Thoughts:Would probably not have ordered this laptop if I had known there was no access covers on the bottom.,5,6

Replaced with a spare I had and installed Linux and the machine has been running great ever since. Build quality is a little cheap.,"Other Thoughts:I would have recommended this in 2014 if you wanted it for more basic or office functions.

At the time of purchase, this notebook was on sale for about 230$ brand new (non-refurb). Knowing that you get what you pay for, I took a gamble on this machine. I was actually quite surprised. I remain very picky about notebook PC's, and this one passed my skepticism.With that being said, I would most definitely NOT purchase this product for its current price as of the time of this review (over 500$), but if it goes on sale again below 300$ I would recommend it for anyone needing a good machine at a fair price.I could go into technical details, but I'll leave that to those with questions.",0,0

Read ""other thoughts"" for more.","Other Thoughts:You get what you pay for, I guess. Don't buy this. When I first got it about six months ago, it was messed up during updating and was just slow in general once I got it working. It's still slow as heck and the graphics are awful. I can't play any games whatsoever. It freezes constantly, especially when using the internet (high quality internet) even at times when I had been submitting assignments for school, which sucked. The speakers are absolutely terrible and have been warbled off and on, but finally after six months of owning this laptop, they suddenly just gave out for no reason and any tiny noise like a facebook notification is very loud, drawn out static. I've plugged in computer speakers, headphones, etc and the sound is the same terrible noise. I have taken great care with this laptop, but these things have still happened. The back doesn't come off, so there's no way to get inside the computer. I can't return it because the warranty was only 30 days. My experience with the laptop has been really not great and even if I could send it in to get it looked at (somehow, even though you can't psychically look inside it to repair any internal things), I wouldn't want it back again.

I have two ASUS routers and an awesome RoG laptop that I souped up a bit.  Sadly, this laptop is inferior junk, falling far, far below what I expect from ASUS.  Out of the box, it wouldn't update to 8.1 correctly.  It would hit update 112 out of 113 and fail, resulting in an OS rollback.After I finally got the Windows 8.1 installed by allowing updates to install automatically over the course of several days, I was able to start using the laptop.  Over the course of a couple of hours, got some basic software installed and called it a night.The following morning, the system froze booting the OS.  A reboot lead to an OS restore.  This repeated several times over the course of a few days.After a week of trying, I gave up.  When I eventually felt up to tackling this horrible laptop again, I found it wouldn't even boot and it would hang while trying to perform an OS recovery.  Disgusted, I put it away again.That brings me to the time of this review.  The system will not boot.  It will not perform an OS recovery.  It throws an error related to windows.efi and does nothing.In short, this laptop is detritus.  I regret that I cannot give it less than  one egg.","Other Thoughts:It's quite possible I have a single bad instance of this model.

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,3,Its good while it works,2014-08-30,"Pros:I bought this notebook for school purposes. I usually run microsoft word, power point, adobe reader, internet browser, and occasionally for games. It suits my purpose because i'm able to carry this notebook with me to school and back and work on tasks on the go. The boot speed is average depending on my how much data is on the hard drive. It runs smoothly when I play music through it, and im able to run a hdmi out to a sound system to receive the best quality it can offer.","Cons:3 months after I purchased this notebook, the hard drive stopped working and I lost many important document and files. However I contacted asus technical support for warranty service  and they were able to help me get it fixed. The service was reliable because i was able to receive my product back with in 7 days. Only thing they did was replace the hard drive with a smaller capacity of 250 gb. Before the original hard drive offered 500gb. I wasn't to happy with that but It would do fine for me since I have a 1TB external drive.Another problem iv'e been having is with the laptop screen. It sometimes starts glitching out by flashing on and off and sometimes the screen shuts off completely, which then I am forced to restart it and i loose projects that i was working on because i can't see the screen so i can save it. I'm unsure what is causing this problem but I hope if the screen eventually gives out, asus is able to service this product.","Other Thoughts:Overall if you are looking for a notebook that is going to be used for typing essays,researching, or casual browsing i would recommend it but for an extra 100$ you can get a more reliable laptop",1,0

You cannot install any other operating system besides Windows 8. The laptop died because the headset accidentally touched the USB port. The only thing that I can do to fix it without voiding the warranty is to hold down the power button. Did that and did not help at all. The battery is not removable unless the notebook is disassembled and the warranty voided. I contacted customer service and they suggested I should ship in the laptop to a service center. Even though they did not make a definitive statement, they said that it is very likely that the warranty will not cover any of the repairs. The estimated cost for such repairs was $136.  While I understand that it may be partly my fault to plug in the headset into the wrong port, I think we can all agree that if you design a notebook so sensitive, maybe you should put the USB ports and the headset jack far apart instead of right next to each other.","Other Thoughts:I have not decided yet what I will do to fix my laptop, but I definitely regret purchasing this product and strongly suggest you stay away from it.

If you can get the operating system to actually work it is a good deal.","Cons:It is fairly well known that the windows 8.1 update has a habit of breaking ASUS laptops. In fact, multiple reviewers on this site have had similar issues during the updating process. ASUS/Microsoft don't seem to really care about this issue.Furthermore, due to the locked down BIOS it is virtually impossible to install an operating system other than Windows 8, and since the Windows 8.1 update bricks the machine you will be stuck with the stock windows 8  OS until the machine dies. I'm beginning to think that the only purpose on having these cheap windows 8 laptops is to increase market share for the embarrassment that is Windows 8.This is my second ASUS laptop, and I cannot say that there will be a third.",,1,1

Instead of paying to RMA this, I purchased the exact same hard drive from Newegg and replaced the old one for cheaper than shipping this thing back and forth to ASUS. Now it works great!","Other Thoughts:Newegg is great once again (prices, selection, & shipping time) but Asus has really let me down in terms of customer service and quality control (see review below).",1,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,4,Great with windows 7,2014-07-17,"Pros:It's a fairly well l put together laptop. I like the keyboard is generally fast enough for most video and streaming applications. However I couldn't stand using it with windows 8, so if you have the ability to ""downgrade"" to windows 7, do it. if not look elsewhere for a laptop. WIndows 7 increases pep and usability by many multiples, however the process of downgrading is a lot trickier than it used to be, it takes quite a few BIOS settings changes.","Cons:The screen has a very low viewing angle, the touchpad isn't great and Windows 8 on this computer makes it unusable.",,0,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,1,Great...then terrible thanks to Windows 8.1 Update,2014-07-08,"Pros:Before I begin, I want to say Newegg gets 5/5 eggs because I bought this laptop on a Sunday and got it Tuesday.I got this laptop for my wife's business because all she really needed it for was to open internet browsers and use applications like MS Word and Excel. When I first got it, it worked GREAT. We initially had to go through over 60 updates out of the box to get the laptop fully updated and running which wasn't a big deal as it did this overnight and was ready to go in the morning. After that the laptop worked GREAT and was fast to boot up and open applications.For the first month this laptop ran perfectly and was a great bargain.","Cons:Unfortunately, last week the laptop updated to windows 8.1 and the machine that was working perfectly stopped working. It took about 15 minutes to fully boot into windows 8.1 and about the same amount of time to shut down. Simple tasks, like opening Internet Explorer, took 5-10 minutes. After opening task manager, I noticed that the hard drive utilization rate was at 100% and never went below 100%. After researching the issue and spending over 6 hours trying to resolve this issue from disabling services to running the check disk command, nothing seemed to help the problem.Because nothing worked, I decided that I would reset the laptop using Windows 8 Recovery Options and just not allow Windows to update to 8.1 for the short term as my wife needed the laptop for her business this week. The rest got to 98% then failed.Now when I boot the laptop and a blue screen comes up and says the reset failed and to contact the manufacturer for assistance. I contacted ASUS and they said I'd either have to RMA it or go and buy Windows 8.1 and fresh install it. I asked them if they could provide me with a recovery disk/USB (as the laptop doesn't come with one) and they said that they don't have any for windows 8. Anyhow, I would't recommend this laptop unless you are not planning on leaving Windows Automatic Updates off.And just to be clear, there was no application installed on the laptop. It was only used for surfing the web up to this point.ASUS customer service gave me a completely unsatisfactory resolution and I won't be buying their products again.","Other Thoughts:I just wanted to share my final communication with ASUS after trying to get this issue resolved, with some edits in brackets.:-----------------------ME---------------------------Hi [NAME OF ASUS CUSTOMER SERVICE REP],I'm not very happy with your response but I want to make sure that I understand what you are saying. You are saying my only options are to a)buy windows 8.1 (another $119) for my laptop now or pay around $100 to have it shipped to ASUS for you guys to plop it down onto one of your imaging stations to re-image the hard drive? There is no way of getting a restore disk/jump drive from you that would quickly or easily solve this problem? All I wanted to do is reset the machine using the Windows 8 built in recovery tools. As this failed, I'm reaching out to the trusted manufacturer for help and I'm feeling really frustrated because I know how easy it is to burn a restore disk DVD of the image that was originally on the machine. If this is indeed the case, can you please flag this ticket for your supervisor for review?Please keep in mind we are taking about a [WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR] laptop here and I've already sunk more of my personal time that what its worth so now this is a matter or pride to get  this issue resolved satisfactorily for me. Whatever the resolution is, I'll be sure to make sure that my friends, family, and the IT professionals I work with aware of the result. I'll also be leaving review feedback on Newegg as well.Every other ASUS product I have every purchased (and also recommended to my  family and friends) has never had this issue because I knew that ASUS cared about  manufacturing things correctly the first time and they were always quick about solving  customer service problems.I appreciate you taking the time to resolve to this issue.

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,4,ASUS D550MA review,2014-07-08,"Pros:Very good price for the performance.  I went through 2 other computers before settling on this one.  You need to take a look at the cost of a warranty when buying a laptop and Newegg offered one for great price on this one.  Other models, especially refurbished can cost twice theirs.Windows 8 takes some getting use too.  Upgrading to Windows 8.1 will take a few days because you'll have to run through quite a few updates until there are no required updates before installing the 8.1 update.  But all the laptops are like this.  After the 8.1 install, the laptop runs faster and has a few nicer features.This laptop is a really good general use laptop for internet and document processing. It doesn't scream through applications because of the processor, but for the price you can't beat it.Because audio and screen quality is up there with the others it makes a nice laptop to watch a streaming video or listen to online radio station like Pandora.  Laptop screen resolution isn't stellar, but you can plug in an extra monitor it handles it just fine.After my Dells died prematurely, I will not buy another one of them ever and not sure about HPs either.","Cons:Would be hard to upgrade memory or drive.  No easy access from the bottom which means you would have to rip apart the laptop to do it.

I really only use it for e-mails, Facebook, and general surfing.   My problem is this---when I go to a sight like Huffington Post,  each story takes absolutely forever to load!

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,3,It's okay,2014-06-24,"Pros:A lot better than my five year old HP that's falling apart. The track pad takes time to get used to, and so does Windows 8. I don't know if I'll be returning this yet or not. I ordered it on a Sunday and got it on a Thursday. Delivery was fine. It's sort of cool I guess with the apps and stuff, but I really prefer my old laptop and Windows 7.","Cons:I had to do an update after a few days and it went okay until the end when it got stuck on a loop of ""Failure configuring Windows features...Reverting changes."" It didn't matter what I did in terms of forcing shut down. It would just go right back to that screen after the ASUS logo came up. I had to get on two tech support services and make 3 separate cases in order to fix it. It was stuck on that screen for five hours. I just now was able to fix it and log in to my computer again. I had to refresh my computer, which forced firefox, avast and other stuff all off and I had to re-download them. Not the best thing to happen for a new laptop with all of your school stuff on it. I don't really trust it and I'm really scared this is just going to keep happening over and over again, but I won't know until I'm forced to update again. At least I have my files all on my old laptop.","Other Thoughts:Idk, I don't know if it's a corrupt Windows 8 thing and I'll have to return this laptop or not. If it hadn't done that I would have given this 4 or 4.5 stars. It's really not that bad, but I'm afraid to do anything or keep any of my pictures, Word files, and music on here and ended up keeping my other laptop, which kind of defeats the purpose of spending the money to get a new one. I'm a college student and don't have a lot to spend right now, but I guess you get what you pay for.",3,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,5,ASUS D550MA-DS01 Laptop review,2014-06-19,"Pros:Quick boot up, nice display, sound about what you would expect from a laptop, case decent, large touchpad",Cons:Not crazy about Windows 8.,"Other Thoughts:Newegg service was outstanding. Ordered Saturday, received on Tuesday with regular free shipping.",1,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,5,Decent Laptop for the price,2014-06-17,"Pros:Great laptop for it's price, which is relatively low. Decent speed, good graphics.","Cons:Laptop is not very user serviceable; the bottom of the chassis comes off in one large piece, and does not have separate battery, hard drive, or memory compartments. Would be difficult to upgrade RAM or HDD because of this. It's a Celeron processor, but for this price not really a con.","Other Thoughts:Not recommended for medium to high end gaming. Would be able to run small flash games, but that's about all. Not a con for this price. If a person needs a computer for graphics or video editing or high end gaming, I would not recommend this laptop.",1,0

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,4,"Not bad, just tried to do to much for an inexpensive computer",2014-06-12,"Pros:Quick boot, processor is decent as multitasking with many different programs is smooth and efficient. Most definitely not for gaming (which I knew before buying it) but  a good little workhorse. Light and compact.","Cons:Unfortunately they tried to pack a lot of features into this laptop that usually function great in a more expensive computer, but are simply mediocre in this application. The biggest issue is the mouse commands. Scrolling up and down works great 95% of the time, but scrolling side to side is extremely intermittent (which, with the new windows 8 user interface, can be rather annoying as there are many apps  that require side-to-side scrolling). This is not necessarily that big of a deal simply because you can side scroll the old fashion way by dragging the bar, but still a feature that would be convenient if reliable. Zooming works great with the pinching motion standard on other devices like smartphones or tablets. The last issue that drove me mad (as there was no tutorial that popped up  for me on these features until owning it for a week or two) was the flick off of the left of the mousepad that changes the window you're working on. Brilliant idea if it worked consistently as it could greatly increase productivity, but it was extremely touchy when I did not intend to switch windows and rarely worked when I intentionally used it (and yes, I double checked to make sure I was doing it right). I simply turned it off so I did not have to worry about it either way.","Other Thoughts:Asus makes great computers and I have used them reliably for years. This laptop fits into that category except for mainly in the case of the mouse controls. Updates and initial boot can take ages which is normal, but DO NOT PUT THEM OFF until they force auto install because it will always come at a bad time where you cannot afford for it to happen (i.e. me during finals week this year). Overall a great computer, but Windows can still do a better job of teaching users how to use their new interface.",3,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,1,Bad Choice for what I wanted,2014-06-09,Pros:Quick Booting,"Cons:No flexibility to uninstall OS that was shipped with laptop. BIOS options were extremely locked down, even after disabling UEFI features. Do not buy this laptop if you dont like windows8.","Other Thoughts:If your buying this laptop to get rid of Win8 upon arrival, do not buy this laptop.

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,4,Difficult Set Up,2014-06-07,Pros:Good deal for the money. DVD/CD Drive,Cons:There were 99 critical downloads when first started. It took hours to download  and reconfigure then failed. Took forever to then reconfigure back to set up before updates. I finally connected with a wire instead of wireless and left overnight which then worked. It then took hours to update to 8.1 and do the setup. Once this was all done the computer works fine.,,2,0

Various Asus and other brands are handcuffed by this problem ( model specific).

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,5,No Problems With This Laptop,2014-05-23,Pros:It boots quickly into Windows 8 or Ubuntu 14.04. The fan is inaudible. The laptop stays cool. The price is really good. The webcam is acceptable quality for video chatting.,Cons:There are no USB slots on the right side of the machine because of the CD-ROM drive.,"Other Thoughts:This is a great introductory PC to get into Windows 8, but I still recommend to replace the OS with Ubuntu. Windows 8 is not as good as Ubuntu. This laptop is also good as a cheap replacement for your grandparent's aging hardware.",4,2

I would recommend this for sure.,2,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,3,My Notebook Review,2014-05-05,"Pros:The notebook works, looks nice and seems fast to be ready to function.  I have had several communications with Newegg reps and Asus reps which helped me somewhat  understand how to best use which ever version of Asus I received. It seems my notebook is a newer modified version called X-Series. It has an X551MA mother board inside which might be great (according to ID system).  My opening screen and systems data list indicates model, as does the original box the computer arrived in, which has a paper stick-on marked X551.","Cons:I do not like all the junky Win-8 gimmick boxes wanting to sell me products. Over 80+ Updates had to be downloaded!  No manual or literature to help me!  I discovered my D550MA has an X551MA inside!  I have no idea what this means for me (good or bad). The 116 page online downloadable manual is generic and not specific to my notebook! Seems seller and manufacturer are not too knowledgeable about this and advertised it having Touch Screen when I bought it. But, NO touch screen!","Other Thoughts:I am trying to get answers as to what kind of computer do I really have!  I am not unhappy with the price but a ""machine in a box"" is really a poor way to help a customer use a new device with no real assistance. Item did not match Newegg's online ad and photo of it! What to do is really a headache!",2,3
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,5,Sweet,2014-05-05,"Pros:I've already upgraded to Windows 8.1.  Notebook is light, use is simplified for all users, and it's not the fastest but it still pretty decent on speed.  Couldn't have asked for a better notebook and for the price.","Cons:It's not a touch screen, but it's really no big deal.","Other Thoughts:Love you Newegg, there's nothing better than a smooth purchase.

ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,4,Excellent so far,2014-02-26,Pros:Good price.Windows 8 was only horrible for the first 10 minutes.Boots fast.Numpad.,"Cons:Only one RAM slot. The device comes with one 4G RAM stick, and it says it supports up to 8G. So I thought I would buy an extra stick of RAM. After I cracked this thing open, turns out there's only one slot. Had to return the 4G stick to get an 8G instead.","Other Thoughts:I haven't had this device too long, so I'll come back later. If needed.",7,0
ASUS,D550MA-RS01-WH,4,Good Initial Impression,2014-02-20,"Pros:The physical feel of this machine was better than I expected of a $319 laptop. It is sturdy without being heavy and light enough to not be cumbersome.Price for Performance Ratio is quite good, I for what you are paying you will be hard pressed to find something better built, with better performance, and made by a better and more reputable manufacturer.This machine was purchased as a home computer replacement and seems to be up to the task. It handles multi-tasking well and was surprisingly easy to set up. I am still working on getting a bit better grading criteria for its abilities, but as for now if you are not gaming you should do quite well with this machine.","Cons:The mouse pad is a bit different, and I'm certain some will love it, but I am not crazy about the feel. As far as new ""swipe"" set up....well I just haven't got into it yet as I tend not to use a mouse pad unless I am setting a machine up and testing its functions....I'm just a mouse kind of guy.I was a slight bit saddened by the lap top only having 2 USB ports (1 x 3.0 and 1 x 2.0). This is a bit light considering the amount of peripherals we all tend to use these days. I.E.: Headset, mouse, printer, charging other electronics, uplinks to other electronics, etc.I fixed this by purchasing a $7 USB hub and called it good. I couldn't justify spending the extra $50-70 to get two more USB ports on the machine itself.",Other Thoughts:Now to the OS....Windows 8.....the (not so great IMO) compromise. I had to install 89 updates to this machine the second I started it up. THIS WAS NO FAULT OF ASUS. Windows 8.1 and an multiple other updates due to it were rather cumbersome and lengthy.I'm not a fan of the app based look as it seems overly complicated to navigate between certain aspects of normal use that are easy to transition between in windows 7. This very well may be fixed in time as I familiarize myself with the new OS and some of the features that 8.1 brings to the table....time will tell.,9,0
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,1,Last review got Deleted - Here is my second 1 Egg review,2019-03-16,"Pros:Was on sale, so price was ok...","Cons:I owned this product for a week, and I had to send it in for an RMA on my dime.took a month and a half but they did replace the main board and fix it.5 months later....Right hinge is broken and the frame around the screen is coming undone.  We had to duct tape the cheap plastic frame together.I would do another RMA, but after the horrible experience with Acer's customer service, I think i will just use it till something else on it breaks.","Other Thoughts:DO NOT BUY!To whoever responds from Acer, NO THANKS!  I don't want to go to your website and spend 2 hours trying to navigate that monstrosity of a website, fill out the right forms, and send in all the right paperwork.   I don't want to talk to another unhelpful customer service agent who does not believe that something is actually wrong with the laptop.  I don't want to pay for the postage and insurance to send your terrible product back to you.  I don't want to wait 1-2 months while I pay to rent another laptop in the meantime.  I don't want to cross my fingers and hope you guys don't somehow try to blame me for the terrible product not working and charge me for repairs.I will never buy another Acer product again, and as soon as this review is deleted, you better believe I will be putting it right back up.",0,0
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,3,Great computer,2019-03-14,"Pros:Fast, good graphics",Cons:The only thing I don't like is small hard drive.

It has such a narrow viewing angle, if I move my head up and down a tiny bit, the colors are off! I have never had laptops and computers with such a trash display screen, and I don't understand how they can put ""IPS, wide viewing angle' in the display spec. As the screen goes, really felt like I'm being SCAMEDDO NOT buy this laptop if you work in the creative field and rely on accurate display screen!","Other Thoughts:Seriously, please scratch the ""IPS, wide viewing angle"" under display spec, it really feels like a scam. :(",0,0
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,1,Fell apart after 7 months,2019-01-21,Pros:Nice price for hardware specs,Cons:Won't last long with terrible design,"Other Thoughts:Updating my old review to say to avoid this style of Acer laptop. For some reason, one of the ""features"" is that the laptop display can be folded back far enough to allow the entire open laptop to lay flat. The hinges that allow this movement feel really flimsy, and the display moves back and forth really easily when you move the laptop around. I just ignored this at first, but then the plastic around the hinges broke after months of regular use. I tried to use it anyway, but it didn't take long for that to cause damage to the display itself. Of course, the warranty doesn't cover ""physical damage"", even if it's caused by their terrible product design. I'm strapped for cash at the moment, so rather than spend $400 on repairs, I just bought a refurbished HP laptop that's a couple years older for $300 instead. Better track record, and the display actually feels sturdy. Really annoying to have to brick a laptop due to a design problem rather than hardware failure. Soured me on Acer in general in the future.",0,0

Cursor can go all over the place with this one-piece unit.  VERY FRUSTRATING!!!

Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,3,Don't let the rating mislead you,2018-11-13,"Pros:I've never really done a detailed review before, but I saw this on sale again and thought I'd write one up since I've had it for a couple years now. Also, just for some background, 20M wanting to go back to college (was previously in a digital media/photography program), heavy computer gamer, reads manga, watches anime/Netflix.- Very fast boot up time and program start up- Fairly portable (for a 17.3"")- LED back-lit keys- Good battery life- Num-pad on the sideWhen I received this laptop, I did not expect it to have such a fast boot up time. I speak from experience as I have a main desktop computer that has the renowned Samsung EVO 850 series. Not only that, but light programs boot up fairly quickly as well (Internet browser, File explorer, Photo Viewer, emulators, and others.)  Obviously, 256GB of storage doesn't cut it if you plan to store tons of pictures/videos on it, but if your business/school work is mostly done online, this shouldn't be a problem. I had always read that lugging around a 17.3"" laptop is a nightmare, but honestly, I've never had that thought with this laptop. I don't know, maybe I'm just not very picky, and I'm a pretty small-set guy, but I have yet to break my back carrying this thing around. If you've used any Windows operating system, you won't feel intimidated by Windows 10 UI at all. In fact, the Control Panel is so much better compared to all other Windows versions, so that's nice. Back-lit keyboard is nice for when I'm typing up a paper while my roommate was trying to sleep; just another nice feature for quality-of-life purposes. One other thing is the num-pad. I know a lot of people take this for granted and hate having to finagle with the numbers above the keyboard, but the num-pad is just one those preferences I have. Might help if you're in a financing class or something that has a lot to do with numbers.","Cons:- Unpleasant screen- ""Inaccurate"" track pad and shortcuts- Very low-end graphics- Poor audioIf you're looking for a crispy, clear, and color accurate display, you are going to be extremely disappointed. The screen on this laptop will have you wanting to use it on full brightness just to have a clear image of what you're looking at, which comes at the cost of battery life. I wouldn't even call the screen ""good""; a better descriptor might be ""bearable"". Also, viewing angles? What viewing angles? Anyway, the track pad is arguably one of the worst I've ever used. I've found myself struggling to close out of windows every now and then, and I'm not just a laptop scrub either. This track pad is just frustrating to use and the same goes for it's shortcut features. I strongly recommend getting a wired/wireless mouse for this and just disable the track pad. The speakers for this laptop is also on the bottom of the laptop, and as with most laptops with this feature, it's going to sound horrible. It made me grateful for the laptops that have the speakers on top instead, but those can get a little pricey. I can't be too picky about this detail though because headphones can cure this problem easily. Just get yourself some cans or ear-buds for this. Lastly, do NOT get this for gaming... If gaming is a hobby of yours and you're wanting to get this as a hybrid for school/business work and gaming, you're going to be highly disappointed. The 940MX obviously sounds better than any Intel Integrated Graphics, but I can assure you, you'll find yourself turning all your settings on all your games to the lowest and barely manage 60 FPS. If you're used to 30 FPS, you might be able to get away with this, but at that point you might want to invest into a different laptop.","Other Thoughts:All in all, this laptop is an exceptional laptop for light school/business work and will surely get the job done. For $500.00, this laptop is probably one of my favorite budget peripherals. This laptop is perfect for you want to quickly boot your laptop at 11:30pm to type an essay that's due at midnight without waking up your roommate... and maybe play a game of League of Legends at 30 FPS with a terrible track pad. Might be a little exaggerated, but in all honesty, if your budget is only $500.00, it's a decent purchase, but you might want to take a look at the higher end laptops (aka 2-in-1s).",2,0

I bought this because other reviews mentioned it was IPS panel, which is actually false. This is a TN panel with narrow viewing angle, changing colors at a wide angle.- only 1 display refresh rate setting: 60Hz only. Sorry anime fans out there, this laptop won't support 48Hz.","Other Thoughts:Only time I would recommend this laptop to is light gamers. As TN panels have the lowest latency, I would definitely recommend it for casual gamers looking for low budget laptop; they would most likely use a USB mouse anyway, making horrible touchpads not a problem for them. Otherwise, I would not recommend this product. There are cheaper laptop options that offer IPS FHD 15.6"" display for people who just want internet browsing and video streaming.  The GPU and CPU are nice for some video/photo editing, but TN panel's subpar color is not optimal for video/photo editors. I was contemplating between this laptop and a Ryzen CPU lenovo ideapad 330, and chose this mainly because of reviews mentioning IPS display. It is very disappointing that it turned out to be a TN display, but product description and specification never mentioned it so I suppose that is on me.",6,2
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,4,"great specs for the price, display quality not great",2018-08-11,"Pros:- current gen i5, upgradable RAM and a free m.2 slot- good amount of I/Os- price- not a touch screen",Cons:- the LCD has awful viewing angles. Is it really an IPS?- keeps doing a disk check every time it reboots after power off. not sure what that is about. (Fixed with windows updates),"Other Thoughts:my girlfriend decided she wants to get into coding as it'll be useful for her job so I set out to buy her a laptop with the following criteria: $600 max, 8th gen core i5, discrete GPU, 8GB ram, no touchscreen, solid state drive. When this one dropped to $500 I pulled the trigger. The only gripe I have is the LCD is pretty awful if not viewed from a very specific angle and the disk check thing which I imagine will be solved when I install an nvme drive and throw windows on that. It never finds any errors or problems and can be skipped but it's a bit annoying. Other than that it's perfect. I have no qualms about the build quality or the track pad but I wasn't expecting a macbook pro at this price range. The odd thing I noticed while is shopping is the touchscreen laptops with this hardware were all cheaper. I would steer everyone away from them though. IMO they are like cars sold with CVT transmissions. They make back the difference and then some when you need to fix it and you will. Very happy with this and I will update the review if the disk check persists or becomes a bigger issue. 4.5 stars! Update: did windows updates for like 3 hours and the disk check went away.",4,1

The first kit they sent was just a caddy. The second kit had the cable but it wasn't long enough. They said this is the only cable for my model and offered to send an installation pamphlet. I guess they didn't believe me when I said it doesn't reach, and also would have to twist 180 degrees to connect to the mainboard. It's not the correct part.I read in the Q&A that they have a long version of the cable but that's probably out of date now and I was fed up after four calls and three weeks wasted on the incorrect kits anyway. It would have been three calls but I was left on hold for so long on the third that I had to call back to make sure something wasn't wrong with the dead silent line. After that I brought it down to a PC shop and they said they could order a cable long enough. This didn't work either, HDD is not showing up.I finally give up trying to utilize this storage bay after three weeks of shipping parts and receiving incorrect kits from Acer. It's obvious this unit was never intended to be upgraded; disposable machines. I will never buy Acer again.",5,0

Mild bloat ware but i'm not crazy with a hacksaw, don't mind some bloat as long as it don't run in the background.  Took about 8-10 hrs to get updates and remove bloat, updates were crazy and the junky Norton antivirus took forever to uninstall but that was due to me not unchecking a box that installed some more norton junk as I was trying to uninstall the first Norton junk.

Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,4,Best laptop for $500,2018-07-18,"Pros:- Good display, it's nothing absolutely mind-blowing, but it does look crisp and you can tell this is where the budget factor comes in.  Something as much as 15 degrees off axis is enough to blow the colors out. It is easy to clean, however.- The keyboard is wonderful. The keys don't feel like you're pushing down on mashed potatoes, and it boasts a num-pad, which is cherished. The backlight is great on this device.- Battery-life is superb. Can easily pull 6 hours of use.- RAM is plentiful. For 8GB of DDR4 ram, you will probably never even need that much ram. Can have Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, and browse websites at the same time.- VERY large display. I prefer this because you can just do MORE, you can see that because it's a cheaper display they were able to make it absolutely massive.- SPEAKERS ARE 9/10. They're load, hit the highs well without bleeding, however the bass struggles, which is okay. You can hear this thing CLEARLY across the room on 80%. Could probably use this as a small TV.- Utilitarian device. Ethernet, USB-C, HDMI, USB 3.1 (x3), SD Card Reader. Really good. Love that.","Cons:- Trackpad/Touchpad is absolute garbage. The placement is terrible, and it is hard to press-down and very cheap-feeling. You do get kind of used to it, but I still make accidentally right-click bumps because of the irregular placement of it. Maybe better off using a mouse connected to the laptop, which you can do fortunately due to the many ports.- Personally, I would rather have a 512GB HDD over a 256 GB SSD. But that is a mixed bag for what you want out of this computer. Just a personal opinion for me.- Is the fan kind-of loud? If there's another sound in the room you won't really notice it, but if the room is quiet (like a library), the fan kicks on really easily and you can REALLY hear it. That also may be just personal preference though.","Other Thoughts:I would use this laptop for college, work, and it really good. If there was a 512 GB  HDD option, I would totally use that, and I prefer using a mouse (because the trackpad placement and quality is just, bad). But this is the best laptop you can buy for  $500.",3,0

Run's windows so I can run Flight Planner (only reason I have to buy a windows laptop)M.2 port (in use with 256gb SATA SSD).   So could upgrade it to a larger NVME drive but would lose the Windows install.Nvidia 940mx (not sure i'd game anything on it, but might be useful for Opencad)","Cons:Update:  the sata cable came in and is too short to reach the horizontal HDD in its drive bay.  I instead put the HDD where the slot is for the DVD drive by using a bandsaw to cut off most of the DVD drive empty bay plate and mounting the HDD there with double-sided tape (gluing the remnants of the plate cover in place).   Apparently Acer does not offer a longer cable for this model.Update:  adding a 8gb module brings the total ram to 12gb (probably breaking dual-channel).Expected to be able to add a HDD drive but found out I had to order a special sata cable from the Acer website (it has an empty bay).   Their website only lists a diff model from mine but from examining the socket and cable it appears it will work.   The cable cost $84gb SODIMM (DDR4) on expansion card, so must have another 4gb on motherboard.  At the current costs of 16gb modules I don't think i'll test buying one to see what happens...  it lists the max memory as 16gb (an 8gb would in theory give me a 12gb system if that works)","Other Thoughts:The model of mine that comes with 1TB HDD costs about $200 more than I paid.   If the $8 cable I ordered works and allows my $49 1tb HDD to work, I'll have saved some money,  however I've now taken the laptop apart 2x times and will have to do that a 3rd time when the cable comes in.Last years model of this I bought for the wife and it had all the parts/cables inside to expand her's to 16gb of ram and 1tb HDD>",2,0
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,5,This laptop is a steal for only $500!,2018-07-12,"Pros:-Fast processor (I got the i5-8250U)-Integrated graphics (UHD 620) are plenty good enough unless you are a gamer-Solid state drive boots up your computer in a few seconds-No wifi issues, my internet service provider is the limiting factor as usual-Came with no bloatware. I got it all set up within an hour-Screen views nicely from many angles and speakers are good-Mine came with a backlit keyboard-Thin and lightweight compared to my old computer-Quiet and runs relatively cold-There is an empty hard drive bay for upgrades","Cons:-Only one of the two RAM sticks can be easily accessed and upgraded-Difficult to access the SSD and battery. This is a problem since laptop batteries are typically only good for about 5 years. It looks like you would have to remove the laptop's entire bottom casing just to replace the battery. However, this type of stuff makes the laptop more thin and portable-I would recommend getting a good dedicated graphics card if you are a gamer","Other Thoughts:This is a high quality general purpose laptop that works great for nearly all applications.

I suffered some confusion when it arrived. Many reviewers said the storage was expandable via an empty 2.5"" SATA bay. But on my machine, the bay was already occupied by an SSD. Which implied that there was no other place to put storage in the machine, like an m.2 slot on the motherboard.I called ACER support. They were very courteous. After an extended time on hold, and verifying my model and serial number, they swore up and down there was no m.2 slot on the motherboard. I was stuck with the SSD I already had, unless I got a bigger one.But there are several videos on YouTube of people cracking these suckers open and installing an m.2 drive, or upgrading memory.I took my computer to a professional to check it out; I did not want to jack up my new rig because of my incompetence. Even this guy thought I was an idiot to ask him to look for an m.2 slot. I had to talk him into taking my money. He called me a few hours later and confirmed there was an m.2 slot. I still opted just to get a 1 TB 2.5"" SSD instead: cheaper and readily available.Don't take ACER's word for what is inside this computer. I know it sounds crazy. You have room for a 2.5"" SATA and an m.2 SATA drive.If you really want to research it, my motherboard is a KBL Charmander_KL. Maybe other motherboards don't have m.2.Gaming: I average 40 FPS during hot and heavy action in GTA 5. Haven't tried any more demanding games than that.",5,1
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,3,WiFi is Fussy with old drivers plus included SSD is SATA not M.2,2018-06-17,"Pros:Light and sturdy, performance seems OK. Discrete graphics is a plus at this price point, but I haven't played any games yet so not sure how much it'll make a difference to me. Works good with second monitor on HDMI, making it versatile in case the 15"" screen doesn't give you enough display real estate for stuff like using Ancestry and doing research on websites at the same time.","Cons:My model is the 15"" screen, 256GB SSD in regular SATA slot, no M.2 socket that I could find. These laptops are nowhere near the current Win10 patch level, it has been on the shelf since fall 2017. Be ready to spend a solid day allowing it to download and install all updates with like 10 reboots necessary. With default settings and latest driver from Acer website, the Atheros wifi kept dropping and was extremely slow often ""forgetting"" it had internet access. Found slightly newer drivers on a non-Acer website for the same wifi chipset, which seemed to keep connection longer, but still disconnected after a couple hours. Fiddled with the advanced options in the driver to force a ""g-only"" connection even though my router supports ""n"" (older Verizon FIOS wifi router), which resulted in getting passable speed of about 10mb/sec upload to internet and doesn't drop anymore. MAYBE this would not be a problem with a fancy new ""ac""-capable router, but who knows? Had to replace the SSD because it uses the only SATA bay and 256GB is just too small, now it occasionally has trouble booting and ends up at blue screen, then goes through the ""automatic repair"" but then is fine.","Other Thoughts:I'm on the fence about returning it, a brand new laptop shouldn't have these annoying things going on with it.",2,2

Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,5,Great laptop for the price,2018-03-24,"Pros:I had been passively looking for a new laptop for programming for the past few years. I was looking for one with a decent resolution IPS monitor, an SSD, acceptable battery life, and a good CPU, without too high of a price tag. I ended up going with this one during a sale, and I'm very glad I did. 1080p is great at 17.3"", and images are vibrant with great viewing angles. The combination of the CPU and the SSD make for a snappy experience, even under demanding multi-threaded workloads. The keyboard is better than I expected at this price point. Build quality is quite acceptable - it's no ultra-thin, but it is solid and flexing is minimal. I get about 5.5 hours out of a full charge with the screen slightly dimmed. For my use, I didn't need a dedicated GPU, though it's a nice addition. Also, SecureBoot can be disabled","Cons:Sound quality isn't greatThe drive bay under the back panel is empty on my system - to swap out the hard drive, you have no choice but to open up the entire case. I had originally planned to swap in a new drive for Linux so that I could go back to Windows if required, but this setup made that too much of a hassle. Not quite enough to knock off an egg, but it was disappointingThe shipped version of Windows contains the usual bloatware you'll get with a pre-built system, though it wasn't excessive.","Other Thoughts:I bought this with the intention of dual booting windows+linux, but SecureBoot made that decision mutually-exclusive. After a few days of use, I ended up blowing away Windows entirely and installing Fedora 27 Workstation. My experience with that has been flawless - not a single driver has cropped up. It absolutely flies under Fedora as well, even when spinning up many multi-threaded programs at once.Keep in mind that the options for a 17.3"" laptop bag are somewhat limited.

Additional caddy and cable not included for installation of a hard drive.,"Other Thoughts:I believe in my heart that, someday, I will acquire the cable and caddy I need to install my 1TB laptop hard drive, because I genuinely like this laptop.  I am going to do everything in my power to make this happen.But, so far, Acer has somehow managed to orchestrate the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered.  I've read in the Q&A on this product that other customers have, somehow, managed to find the parts they needed and installed them, so I know it's possible.  But so far it's been a labyrinth of lies and ignorance.Attempt 1 - check the store for the parts:  I do.  They're not there.  There's another caddy available, it says its for a very specific laptop model- not mine.  Nothing is listed for my model.  Not even a listing that says ""out of stock.""Livechat session 1 - Model number given.  I ask for the parts.  The rep says they're not available.  But, they exist somehow, because I already know people have managed this.I post a message on the Acer community forums, where a well meaning citizen advises I get in contact with Acer customer support, bless their soul.  So I decide to give it another try.Livechat session 2 - They have my model number.  I am told the caddy and cable will be found in the expansion compartment when I open it up.  I am elated at this possibility.  I open it up.  It is not there.  I take a lot of pictures of the empty space.Livechat session 3 - Still have my model number.  I recount my issues to another representative.  After a long time, they tell me ""I see here that part is not available, my advised for you is get in contact with us.""  [sic]But I was.  I was in contact with them.  At that very moment.  My rep elaborates:  ""for us to send you the HDD caddy kit.  For the time the part is not available. you can contact us within 2 weeks to check is the part can be sent to you."" [sic]Then they told me that the part was out of stock, and then also said it was ""not ready.""  I... so it's just out of stock?  Or has it not been designed yet?  Is it in my laptop, just out of phase of this dimension?Has the real caddy kit been inside me all along?Have I been speaking to Acer representatives, or only to myself?  Surely, these past few days I have only been muttering into a deaf void that yet gibbers nonsense.So, in my nigh infinite well of patience, I'm going to give them time.

My mouse pad has zero issues, unlike the person who gave the one star review over a quirky touchpad.",Cons:None so far.,"Other Thoughts:I can not speak to longevity, as i just received yesterday.

Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,1,Mousepad failed in less than two months,2018-02-01,"Pros:Laptop is fast, battery has good life","Cons:Mousepad failed, which also happened to an older ACER I had (granted that one lasted 5 years).","Other Thoughts:I also did not save the original packaging, so Newegg will not accept the return.",0,8
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,5,Excellent,2017-12-18,Pros:- Large 17 inch high quality IPS screen. Viewing angles are very good and it's a bright display.- Core i5 8250u is a great processor. 4 cores 8 threads is mostly unheard of on laptops today.- MX150 is a solid low-power gpu for light gaming. You won't be maxing out visuals in games but on reasonable settings you can manage 60 fps in most games.  Use MSI Afterburner to add +1000mhz on the memory clock for a rather significant performance boost that many reviews sites have not picked up on. This chip is significantly better than onboard graphics.- Fast 256gb SSD. This is such an important component for general use responsiveness. I'd never buy a laptop without an SSD today.- HD can be added in the empty drive bay,"Cons:- No backlit on the keyboard- Only one accessible ram slot. This can be an issue if you wish to add more ram in the future as you will lose dual channel since the other 4gb of ram seems to be embedded on the motherboard.- Could use more USB 3.0 ports, not sure why manufacturers continue to put more USB 2.0 ports than 3.0 here in 2017.- Temperatures on this model are not great out of the box just like most laptops. Running benchmark applications such as Unigine Valley / Cinebench and the CPU was entering 90s territory when boosting. Fortunately this problem can be solved if you are willing to spend a few minutes undervolting the CPU with Intel Extreme Tuning Utility. I was able to set -0.1v on the CPU and used MSI Afterburner to reduce gpu voltage to 950mV from the default 1012mV. Your mileage may vary as not all chips are created equal. Running GTA V my max temps were 76c on both the CPU & GPU with undervolts & overclocks applied.",Other Thoughts:Overall this is an excellent budget laptop at $650 for someone who wants a laptop that is fast / responsive that is also capable of handling some gaming with playable frame rates. If you are a heavy gamer though it would be worth paying more for a laptop with a GTX 1050.,13,0
Acer,A515-51G-84ZP,3,"Easy to setup, simple laptop",2017-12-14,"Pros:-takes 3mins to set it up-keyboard is silent-can handle big games (ex: bio shock infinite, fallout 4)(on low settings)-nice look to it-when turning on laptop it is incredibly fast to have everything up the way you want. (ex: discord, spotify, chrome)-pretty light for a 17.3 inch laptop-usable for school work-fast usage",Cons:-wifi disconnects several times-hard to play outdoors-issues when using usb mic-volume is decent-handles fallout 4 on low settings to get 40 fps-handles bio shock on low to get 60 fps-handles league of legends greatly using very high settings at 130 fps-no back lit keyboard-last roughly 2-3 hours when playing games unplugged,"Other Thoughts:-i would recommend this to a friend if they were on a budget, but if not then no since there are other products that can be better when it comes to high graphics games",5,5
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away. Great buy, if you were on the edge like me, pull the trigger!",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,Great bang for the buck,2019-02-27,"Pros:It is honestly a beautiful computer, it is very thing and the finish on the back looks really good.its powerful, for these specs I haven't really seen anything else at this price range.the screen is beautifulthe keyboard is greatso far not loud","Cons:the track pad is just plain bad, I've only had it for two days now, and about every 30 minutes it just glitches out for 2 seconds, it's pretty disappointing, but you get what you pay for. When it does work the size and placement are nice, but when it glitches it just does not respond to what you are trying to do.",,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,1
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",4,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight. It weighs less than the tablet/laptop it replaced.","Cons:-I don't have a complaint yet, but I'm not taxing it very hard, so your mileage may vary.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this for a mid-range laptop if you want it to work smoothly but don't want to spend crazy money on something like a Razer Blade.,1,0

ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,Beautiful laptop!,2018-12-07,"Pros:Just to let everyone know, I have low standards for laptops. My previous laptop was 5 years old, was held together by duct tape, and overheated when plugged in. :) So really, any functioning laptop is good to me. I've only had this laptop for a few days, so here goes nothing with my first review!As for pros:-Beautiful, large display! I'm not savvy about colors and video quality, but 4k videos look beautiful on it, in my opinion-Sound quality is loud and crisp!-You can change the brightness level of the lights behind the keyboard, which is nice-Very lightweight laptop! It's really convenient to travel with it and it's so thin!-Fingerprint login is convenient and makes it easy to login-Very fast computer. It loads and opens programs and documents quickly-Long battery life! Up to 8 hours if you're just browsing the internet or watching YouTube videos-Loveeee the metal exterior. It's so sleek and aesthetic!-Keyboard works fine and it's easy to type with-As for gaming, I've only played Don't Starve and Monster Prom (yes don't judge me). The games run well and works fine to me.","Cons:Minor things:-The fan sounds annoyed me a lot. Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,2,Good At First,2018-10-07,"Pros:Lightweight, good looking, fast.",Cons:Major power issue getting worse.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop has begun having some sort of issue which I believe may be related to power. My screen randomly goes black and then comes back. Other times it goes black and I have to hard power down the entire laptop and then restart. Sometimes just after turning on my laptop and launching a web browser with a few tabs (nothing else running) it starts giving me memory errors and crashes Chrome. I have to restart the laptop and then everything is fine.Recently when the screen went black I got the blue windows screen and the error said ""Stop Code: INTERNAL_POWeR_ERROR"". This is happening once or twice a week now. I will not be buying another Asus laptop that's for sure. Wish I had stuck with Lenovo.",2,1
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,1,Very poor LCD quality,2018-07-25,"Pros:- On paper, this laptop has decent processor , hard drive, and video card specs.","Cons:- However, the screen quality is absolutely terrible for an $800 pc. Do not get this pc if you are planning on doing any photo editing or movie viewing or graphic design. Despite numerous attempts to calibrate the color, I couldn't get it anywhere to a usable state. For example, I was looking at one image which I knew was orange but the monitor showed a dull brown color instead. The color accuracy on this is worse than my $400 HP laptop. I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,"Great computer, easy setup, very fast!",2018-07-24,"Pros:The computer is fast, and when I say fast, I really mean its fast! Boot up and turning off is instant. Everything opens super quick due to the SSD and the quad core i5 (8th Gen). The keyboard is perfect for typing especially having it be backlit helps. The design of the computer is nice, battery life is decent but could be better (what do you expect from a 3cell batt). The top of the computer when closed is not gold, its silver. Its a nice brushed aluminum silver. Fingerprint sensor is handy for signing in very quickly. Barely any bloatware!","Cons:No problems so far:The computer is a little ""plasticy."" It's basically all plastic all around the computer except the top of it when closed. The plastic is very delicate so be careful with watches, etc. Took me a little bit to get used to the touch pad, its little off but after some mouse setting adjustments with sensitivity I was able to get it going well.Webcam is very basic, but I don't use it at all.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend it.,0,1

I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1

It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up.

ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0

I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry.

ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,Powerful for the price,2017-12-08,"Pros:This is almost more power than I know what to do with in a laptop! It's got everything and more I was looking for in the price range: Backlit keyboard, 15"" screen, lightweight, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM (though that may get an upgrade someday), and an 8th gen i7 processor! Most other laptops I was looking at in this range only had an i5, or an older i7. And none of them had a dedicated graphics card. It's fast and beautiful. The battery lasts a good while as long as you're not doing anything too extreme like gaming.","Cons:My ""U"" key has come off. I noticed it came loose on the second day of using it, and I've found that it pops off if I hit it just right (or just wrong, depending on how you look at it.) It pops right back on though. A bit of flex in the center of the body and some minutely imperfect seams suggest a slightly cheaper build quality, but it doesn't seem flimsy. Besides the key, I'm not afraid of it falling apart on me with normal use.","Other Thoughts:The other review may be right about the screen colors, but I haven't noticed it being a huge deal. I haven't done any design work like Illustrator or Photoshop on it yet, but I think I'd manage. If design/art/video is your thing though, you may be safer getting a better screen. Also, there is a webcam, it's just the most simple, low-quality, basic webcam on the market. I won't ever use it though, so no biggie. Also, the trackpad is great for a windows machine. I'm used to Mac trackpads, and usually windows ones are absolute garbage in comparison, but this one holds up.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,1,Great specs for price but...,2017-12-07,"Pros:It is everything you would expect based on the specs (e.g., 8th gen i7, ssd + HD, etc),  but...","Cons:The track pad is the worst! It is jittery like all heck! I've truly never used a worse track pad in my life. In addition, a week into using the laptop the cpu fan started making terrible sounds like a bearing was broken.",Other Thoughts:Also note that there is no webcam. Such an easy thing to include! I returned the laptop and bought a better built laptop with lower specs and I am much happier.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,3,WONDERFUL LAPTOP if you don't mind the screen,2017-12-02,"Pros:Incredible specs, backlit keyboard, small bezels",Cons:That silly 45% NTSC screen,"Other Thoughts:According to Newegg, 48% of people end up buying this laptop after viewing it. I wanted to share a few things before you're one of them. To start off, if you like the added portability of laptops with 14"" screens, you'll love the fact that, because of the thin bezels, the 15.6"" display is put into a smaller package! The downfall, however, is the 45% NTSC screen. If you do photography or any media editing, you'll quickly discover that the colors displayed by this screen are beyond inaccurate. Remember The Dress, and how people couldn't tell if it was white or blue? (old Internet meme, look it up). Well, I highly suspect it won't look like either to you if you use this screen!Intel has made a great leap with a quad core processor for conventional laptops. The specs on this baby are outstanding, just realize you're getting a not-so-great screen. And the speakers are on the bottom, but you should've known that by now!",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-EH76,5,Feature rich Thin and Light,2017-10-25,Pros:I search long and hard to find a balance of features to price and this is the closest thing i could find to my perfect laptop at a price that wouldn't destroy my wallet.  i'm still in shock that Intel finally woke up and has started moving along again and the quad core in a mainstream thin and light is proof.  Having 2 ram slots in a thin and light seems like such premium thing since so many others are soldering the ram on.  I know most can do fine for years on 8 gigs of ram but i've already maxed it out with one of my programs and i'm sure i will upgrade to 16 before too long.  The back lit keyboard is oh so nice and the screen is pretty nice quality.  I know this screen isn't as color accurate as some of the other screens i use but it's close enough for draft work.,"Cons:- Plastic casing around the keyboard is a bit springy and has a bit of movement, nothing crazy mind you.- The Thermal limit is very low on these 8th gen chips and with the just passable cooling on this laptop you will constantly be thermal throttling.  I just don't understand why they would thermal throttle this chip at 71C unless Intel is trying to keep it segmented away from it's HQ line.- The pictures on New Egg are not of this model.  They show a finger print reader and this laptop doesn't come with one.  I hate to put this as a con since it's not listed in the specs but someone should do their homework before posting the wrong model pictures.- Plastic chassis has a few imperfections that stick out although the seams on it are crazy good.(the few imperfections stick out bad since the chassis is just so good looking otherwise)",Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking to pick one of these up for productivity on the go.  Photoshop and Premier are great on this laptop and once i swap out the slow harddrive for another SSD then it will be even better.  This laptop is just so much power for such a small and light device.  Also for those worried about the battery life i can say it holds up very well.  For daily browsing and video watching i'm getting just above 6 hours.  When i start editing video that comes down quickly and i've only edited once so far on battery and in 2 hours i ate up just a bit more than half the battery.Gaming - I save this for last because i know people will want to know can it game and while you shouldn't buy this to game it does have chops to hang in old and new games.  You will have to make sacrifices on resolution and quality to play most games though.  I feel that if the laptop had dual pipes and fans then it could keep up and not thermal limit on such a low limit imposed by intel.,10,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away. Great buy, if you were on the edge like me, pull the trigger!",3,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,4,Great bang for the buck,2019-02-27,"Pros:It is honestly a beautiful computer, it is very thing and the finish on the back looks really good.its powerful, for these specs I haven't really seen anything else at this price range.the screen is beautifulthe keyboard is greatso far not loud","Cons:the track pad is just plain bad, I've only had it for two days now, and about every 30 minutes it just glitches out for 2 seconds, it's pretty disappointing, but you get what you pay for. When it does work the size and placement are nice, but when it glitches it just does not respond to what you are trying to do.",,1,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,1
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",4,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight. It weighs less than the tablet/laptop it replaced.","Cons:-I don't have a complaint yet, but I'm not taxing it very hard, so your mileage may vary.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this for a mid-range laptop if you want it to work smoothly but don't want to spend crazy money on something like a Razer Blade.,1,0

ASUS,S510UA-DS51,4,Beautiful laptop!,2018-12-07,"Pros:Just to let everyone know, I have low standards for laptops. My previous laptop was 5 years old, was held together by duct tape, and overheated when plugged in. :) So really, any functioning laptop is good to me. I've only had this laptop for a few days, so here goes nothing with my first review!As for pros:-Beautiful, large display! I'm not savvy about colors and video quality, but 4k videos look beautiful on it, in my opinion-Sound quality is loud and crisp!-You can change the brightness level of the lights behind the keyboard, which is nice-Very lightweight laptop! It's really convenient to travel with it and it's so thin!-Fingerprint login is convenient and makes it easy to login-Very fast computer. It loads and opens programs and documents quickly-Long battery life! Up to 8 hours if you're just browsing the internet or watching YouTube videos-Loveeee the metal exterior. It's so sleek and aesthetic!-Keyboard works fine and it's easy to type with-As for gaming, I've only played Don't Starve and Monster Prom (yes don't judge me). The games run well and works fine to me.","Cons:Minor things:-The fan sounds annoyed me a lot. Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0

I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2

ASUS,S510UA-DS51,1,Im sure the product is great. everything seemed fine just sucks they cant send me a working version.,2018-06-20,Pros:the screen how it is supposed to come was great. great contrast and color accuracy. has a lot of the features of a much more expensive laptop but remains for the most part a good product. space is great laptop runs quite fast and I would totally be in love if not for the screen issues.,Cons:The problems are more with its shipping. I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,2,Absurd Limited purchasing configuration options,2018-05-05,Pros:Fast machine,Cons:It makes no sense to get just maximum 256 GB M.2 ssd option. I wish I could avoid the Hard drive an the ssd to just get an 1TB ssd. The graphics card has only 2GB video memory an this is very limiting for today apps and games.,Other Thoughts:As it is being sold I could not recommend this product and I already have an Asus laptop,0,18
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Good product for low price very impressive.,2018-04-25,Pros:good and came without having any damage.  brand new item.work windows10 right away and wifi no problem.,Cons:can not find any problem so far.  would perfer to have longer hours of battery if possible.,,0,1
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Good value + ability to upgrade,2018-04-21,"Pros:- Light and well built- Good display- Easy upgradability- Don't let the ""gold"" color turn you off -- t's a very subtle gold.","Cons:- Webcam is pretty poor- Not the best battery life? It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up. And another great experience buying from Newegg, of course.",6,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Excellent laptop!,2018-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful screen, nice keyboard, especially the dedicated Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys on the side, speedy 8th Gen CPU, decent battery life, light weight.","Cons:The Power button next to the Delete Key...  I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry. I have been using Dell laptops for many years, the last one was a Inspiron 7000.   I don't like the newer Dell keyboards.Well done Asus!!",8,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Powerful for the price,2017-12-08,"Pros:This is almost more power than I know what to do with in a laptop! It's got everything and more I was looking for in the price range: Backlit keyboard, 15"" screen, lightweight, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM (though that may get an upgrade someday), and an 8th gen i7 processor! Most other laptops I was looking at in this range only had an i5, or an older i7. And none of them had a dedicated graphics card. It's fast and beautiful. The battery lasts a good while as long as you're not doing anything too extreme like gaming.","Cons:My ""U"" key has come off. I noticed it came loose on the second day of using it, and I've found that it pops off if I hit it just right (or just wrong, depending on how you look at it.) It pops right back on though. A bit of flex in the center of the body and some minutely imperfect seams suggest a slightly cheaper build quality, but it doesn't seem flimsy. Besides the key, I'm not afraid of it falling apart on me with normal use.","Other Thoughts:The other review may be right about the screen colors, but I haven't noticed it being a huge deal. I haven't done any design work like Illustrator or Photoshop on it yet, but I think I'd manage. If design/art/video is your thing though, you may be safer getting a better screen. Also, there is a webcam, it's just the most simple, low-quality, basic webcam on the market. I won't ever use it though, so no biggie. Also, the trackpad is great for a windows machine. I'm used to Mac trackpads, and usually windows ones are absolute garbage in comparison, but this one holds up.",1,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,1,Great specs for price but...,2017-12-07,"Pros:It is everything you would expect based on the specs (e.g., 8th gen i7, ssd + HD, etc),  but...","Cons:The track pad is the worst! It is jittery like all heck! I've truly never used a worse track pad in my life. In addition, a week into using the laptop the cpu fan started making terrible sounds like a bearing was broken.",Other Thoughts:Also note that there is no webcam. Such an easy thing to include! I returned the laptop and bought a better built laptop with lower specs and I am much happier.,0,1
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,3,WONDERFUL LAPTOP if you don't mind the screen,2017-12-02,"Pros:Incredible specs, backlit keyboard, small bezels",Cons:That silly 45% NTSC screen,"Other Thoughts:According to Newegg, 48% of people end up buying this laptop after viewing it. I wanted to share a few things before you're one of them. To start off, if you like the added portability of laptops with 14"" screens, you'll love the fact that, because of the thin bezels, the 15.6"" display is put into a smaller package! The downfall, however, is the 45% NTSC screen. If you do photography or any media editing, you'll quickly discover that the colors displayed by this screen are beyond inaccurate. Remember The Dress, and how people couldn't tell if it was white or blue? (old Internet meme, look it up). Well, I highly suspect it won't look like either to you if you use this screen!Intel has made a great leap with a quad core processor for conventional laptops. The specs on this baby are outstanding, just realize you're getting a not-so-great screen. And the speakers are on the bottom, but you should've known that by now!",2,0
ASUS,S510UA-DS51,5,Feature rich Thin and Light,2017-10-25,Pros:I search long and hard to find a balance of features to price and this is the closest thing i could find to my perfect laptop at a price that wouldn't destroy my wallet.  i'm still in shock that Intel finally woke up and has started moving along again and the quad core in a mainstream thin and light is proof.  Having 2 ram slots in a thin and light seems like such premium thing since so many others are soldering the ram on.  I know most can do fine for years on 8 gigs of ram but i've already maxed it out with one of my programs and i'm sure i will upgrade to 16 before too long.  The back lit keyboard is oh so nice and the screen is pretty nice quality.  I know this screen isn't as color accurate as some of the other screens i use but it's close enough for draft work.,"Cons:- Plastic casing around the keyboard is a bit springy and has a bit of movement, nothing crazy mind you.- The Thermal limit is very low on these 8th gen chips and with the just passable cooling on this laptop you will constantly be thermal throttling.  I just don't understand why they would thermal throttle this chip at 71C unless Intel is trying to keep it segmented away from it's HQ line.- The pictures on New Egg are not of this model.  They show a finger print reader and this laptop doesn't come with one.  I hate to put this as a con since it's not listed in the specs but someone should do their homework before posting the wrong model pictures.- Plastic chassis has a few imperfections that stick out although the seams on it are crazy good.(the few imperfections stick out bad since the chassis is just so good looking otherwise)",Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking to pick one of these up for productivity on the go.  Photoshop and Premier are great on this laptop and once i swap out the slow harddrive for another SSD then it will be even better.  This laptop is just so much power for such a small and light device.  Also for those worried about the battery life i can say it holds up very well.  For daily browsing and video watching i'm getting just above 6 hours.  When i start editing video that comes down quickly and i've only edited once so far on battery and in 2 hours i ate up just a bit more than half the battery.Gaming - I save this for last because i know people will want to know can it game and while you shouldn't buy this to game it does have chops to hang in old and new games.  You will have to make sacrifices on resolution and quality to play most games though.  I feel that if the laptop had dual pipes and fans then it could keep up and not thermal limit on such a low limit imposed by intel.,10,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away. Great buy, if you were on the edge like me, pull the trigger!",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,Great bang for the buck,2019-02-27,"Pros:It is honestly a beautiful computer, it is very thing and the finish on the back looks really good.its powerful, for these specs I haven't really seen anything else at this price range.the screen is beautifulthe keyboard is greatso far not loud","Cons:the track pad is just plain bad, I've only had it for two days now, and about every 30 minutes it just glitches out for 2 seconds, it's pretty disappointing, but you get what you pay for. When it does work the size and placement are nice, but when it glitches it just does not respond to what you are trying to do.",,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",4,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight. It weighs less than the tablet/laptop it replaced.","Cons:-I don't have a complaint yet, but I'm not taxing it very hard, so your mileage may vary.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this for a mid-range laptop if you want it to work smoothly but don't want to spend crazy money on something like a Razer Blade.,1,0

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,Beautiful laptop!,2018-12-07,"Pros:Just to let everyone know, I have low standards for laptops. My previous laptop was 5 years old, was held together by duct tape, and overheated when plugged in. :) So really, any functioning laptop is good to me. I've only had this laptop for a few days, so here goes nothing with my first review!As for pros:-Beautiful, large display! I'm not savvy about colors and video quality, but 4k videos look beautiful on it, in my opinion-Sound quality is loud and crisp!-You can change the brightness level of the lights behind the keyboard, which is nice-Very lightweight laptop! It's really convenient to travel with it and it's so thin!-Fingerprint login is convenient and makes it easy to login-Very fast computer. It loads and opens programs and documents quickly-Long battery life! Up to 8 hours if you're just browsing the internet or watching YouTube videos-Loveeee the metal exterior. It's so sleek and aesthetic!-Keyboard works fine and it's easy to type with-As for gaming, I've only played Don't Starve and Monster Prom (yes don't judge me). The games run well and works fine to me.","Cons:Minor things:-The fan sounds annoyed me a lot. Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Good At First,2018-10-07,"Pros:Lightweight, good looking, fast.",Cons:Major power issue getting worse.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop has begun having some sort of issue which I believe may be related to power. My screen randomly goes black and then comes back. Other times it goes black and I have to hard power down the entire laptop and then restart. Sometimes just after turning on my laptop and launching a web browser with a few tabs (nothing else running) it starts giving me memory errors and crashes Chrome. I have to restart the laptop and then everything is fine.Recently when the screen went black I got the blue windows screen and the error said ""Stop Code: INTERNAL_POWeR_ERROR"". This is happening once or twice a week now. I will not be buying another Asus laptop that's for sure. Wish I had stuck with Lenovo.",2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Very poor LCD quality,2018-07-25,"Pros:- On paper, this laptop has decent processor , hard drive, and video card specs.","Cons:- However, the screen quality is absolutely terrible for an $800 pc. Do not get this pc if you are planning on doing any photo editing or movie viewing or graphic design. Despite numerous attempts to calibrate the color, I couldn't get it anywhere to a usable state. For example, I was looking at one image which I knew was orange but the monitor showed a dull brown color instead. The color accuracy on this is worse than my $400 HP laptop. I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Great computer, easy setup, very fast!",2018-07-24,"Pros:The computer is fast, and when I say fast, I really mean its fast! Boot up and turning off is instant. Everything opens super quick due to the SSD and the quad core i5 (8th Gen). The keyboard is perfect for typing especially having it be backlit helps. The design of the computer is nice, battery life is decent but could be better (what do you expect from a 3cell batt). The top of the computer when closed is not gold, its silver. Its a nice brushed aluminum silver. Fingerprint sensor is handy for signing in very quickly. Barely any bloatware!","Cons:No problems so far:The computer is a little ""plasticy."" It's basically all plastic all around the computer except the top of it when closed. The plastic is very delicate so be careful with watches, etc. Took me a little bit to get used to the touch pad, its little off but after some mouse setting adjustments with sensitivity I was able to get it going well.Webcam is very basic, but I don't use it at all.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend it.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Surprisingly good,2018-07-17,"Pros:battery life: I only use my laptop at night, about 3 hours per day; on one Friday night I finally found that my laptop had been unplugged during the whole week. I watched youtube and did a little bit of coding, not so hardcore but some typical grad student work load. The battery life just surprised me.weight: a 15-inch laptop in my bag, easy peasyports: this one comes with hdmi port, sd card reader, and 3 usb ports; compared to other lightweight laptops this is impressive. no more stupid expensive adapters.heat: so far I've never felt it","Cons:speaker: it works, but not impressive",,3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Lemon Laptop Nightmare,2018-06-22,Pros:Seemed like a good laptop at first..,"Cons:Laptop was purchased 12Apr18 as a gift for my fiancee and it's now 22Jun18 and the laptop STILL has issues. 1st RMA, as soon as I got it back I fired it up and within minutes it locked up again(Please note that I had to PAY ship back a NEW RMA laptop). 2nd RMA after getting it back I didn't notice any intimidate issues.. then after running some stress test software, it both hard locked and the screen was stuck flickering which persisted even after a hard power cycle (even into the BIOS). It eventually went away.. now, here I am 2 months later with this NEW LEMON laptop and frustrated to no end and now working to RMA yet a 3rd time.  I'm at the point I want to trash this and be done with the whole thing. Longtime Asus mobo user since 90's, this is the LAST ASUS LAPTOP I WILL EVER PURCHASE.",Other Thoughts:This is actually an updated review. I had to delete the original review because there doesn't seem to be a way to update.,2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Im sure the product is great. everything seemed fine just sucks they cant send me a working version.,2018-06-20,Pros:the screen how it is supposed to come was great. great contrast and color accuracy. has a lot of the features of a much more expensive laptop but remains for the most part a good product. space is great laptop runs quite fast and I would totally be in love if not for the screen issues.,Cons:The problems are more with its shipping. I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Absurd Limited purchasing configuration options,2018-05-05,Pros:Fast machine,Cons:It makes no sense to get just maximum 256 GB M.2 ssd option. I wish I could avoid the Hard drive an the ssd to just get an 1TB ssd. The graphics card has only 2GB video memory an this is very limiting for today apps and games.,Other Thoughts:As it is being sold I could not recommend this product and I already have an Asus laptop,0,18
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good product for low price very impressive.,2018-04-25,Pros:good and came without having any damage.  brand new item.work windows10 right away and wifi no problem.,Cons:can not find any problem so far.  would perfer to have longer hours of battery if possible.,,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good value + ability to upgrade,2018-04-21,"Pros:- Light and well built- Good display- Easy upgradability- Don't let the ""gold"" color turn you off -- t's a very subtle gold.","Cons:- Webcam is pretty poor- Not the best battery life? It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up. And another great experience buying from Newegg, of course.",6,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Excellent laptop!,2018-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful screen, nice keyboard, especially the dedicated Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys on the side, speedy 8th Gen CPU, decent battery life, light weight.","Cons:The Power button next to the Delete Key...  I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry. I have been using Dell laptops for many years, the last one was a Inspiron 7000.   I don't like the newer Dell keyboards.Well done Asus!!",8,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Powerful for the price,2017-12-08,"Pros:This is almost more power than I know what to do with in a laptop! It's got everything and more I was looking for in the price range: Backlit keyboard, 15"" screen, lightweight, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM (though that may get an upgrade someday), and an 8th gen i7 processor! Most other laptops I was looking at in this range only had an i5, or an older i7. And none of them had a dedicated graphics card. It's fast and beautiful. The battery lasts a good while as long as you're not doing anything too extreme like gaming.","Cons:My ""U"" key has come off. I noticed it came loose on the second day of using it, and I've found that it pops off if I hit it just right (or just wrong, depending on how you look at it.) It pops right back on though. A bit of flex in the center of the body and some minutely imperfect seams suggest a slightly cheaper build quality, but it doesn't seem flimsy. Besides the key, I'm not afraid of it falling apart on me with normal use.","Other Thoughts:The other review may be right about the screen colors, but I haven't noticed it being a huge deal. I haven't done any design work like Illustrator or Photoshop on it yet, but I think I'd manage. If design/art/video is your thing though, you may be safer getting a better screen. Also, there is a webcam, it's just the most simple, low-quality, basic webcam on the market. I won't ever use it though, so no biggie. Also, the trackpad is great for a windows machine. I'm used to Mac trackpads, and usually windows ones are absolute garbage in comparison, but this one holds up.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Great specs for price but...,2017-12-07,"Pros:It is everything you would expect based on the specs (e.g., 8th gen i7, ssd + HD, etc),  but...","Cons:The track pad is the worst! It is jittery like all heck! I've truly never used a worse track pad in my life. In addition, a week into using the laptop the cpu fan started making terrible sounds like a bearing was broken.",Other Thoughts:Also note that there is no webcam. Such an easy thing to include! I returned the laptop and bought a better built laptop with lower specs and I am much happier.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,WONDERFUL LAPTOP if you don't mind the screen,2017-12-02,"Pros:Incredible specs, backlit keyboard, small bezels",Cons:That silly 45% NTSC screen,"Other Thoughts:According to Newegg, 48% of people end up buying this laptop after viewing it. I wanted to share a few things before you're one of them. To start off, if you like the added portability of laptops with 14"" screens, you'll love the fact that, because of the thin bezels, the 15.6"" display is put into a smaller package! The downfall, however, is the 45% NTSC screen. If you do photography or any media editing, you'll quickly discover that the colors displayed by this screen are beyond inaccurate. Remember The Dress, and how people couldn't tell if it was white or blue? (old Internet meme, look it up). Well, I highly suspect it won't look like either to you if you use this screen!Intel has made a great leap with a quad core processor for conventional laptops. The specs on this baby are outstanding, just realize you're getting a not-so-great screen. And the speakers are on the bottom, but you should've known that by now!",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Feature rich Thin and Light,2017-10-25,Pros:I search long and hard to find a balance of features to price and this is the closest thing i could find to my perfect laptop at a price that wouldn't destroy my wallet.  i'm still in shock that Intel finally woke up and has started moving along again and the quad core in a mainstream thin and light is proof.  Having 2 ram slots in a thin and light seems like such premium thing since so many others are soldering the ram on.  I know most can do fine for years on 8 gigs of ram but i've already maxed it out with one of my programs and i'm sure i will upgrade to 16 before too long.  The back lit keyboard is oh so nice and the screen is pretty nice quality.  I know this screen isn't as color accurate as some of the other screens i use but it's close enough for draft work.,"Cons:- Plastic casing around the keyboard is a bit springy and has a bit of movement, nothing crazy mind you.- The Thermal limit is very low on these 8th gen chips and with the just passable cooling on this laptop you will constantly be thermal throttling.  I just don't understand why they would thermal throttle this chip at 71C unless Intel is trying to keep it segmented away from it's HQ line.- The pictures on New Egg are not of this model.  They show a finger print reader and this laptop doesn't come with one.  I hate to put this as a con since it's not listed in the specs but someone should do their homework before posting the wrong model pictures.- Plastic chassis has a few imperfections that stick out although the seams on it are crazy good.(the few imperfections stick out bad since the chassis is just so good looking otherwise)",Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking to pick one of these up for productivity on the go.  Photoshop and Premier are great on this laptop and once i swap out the slow harddrive for another SSD then it will be even better.  This laptop is just so much power for such a small and light device.  Also for those worried about the battery life i can say it holds up very well.  For daily browsing and video watching i'm getting just above 6 hours.  When i start editing video that comes down quickly and i've only edited once so far on battery and in 2 hours i ate up just a bit more than half the battery.Gaming - I save this for last because i know people will want to know can it game and while you shouldn't buy this to game it does have chops to hang in old and new games.  You will have to make sacrifices on resolution and quality to play most games though.  I feel that if the laptop had dual pipes and fans then it could keep up and not thermal limit on such a low limit imposed by intel.,10,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,1,Customer service is horrible,2019-03-06,Pros:nice looking device,Cons:warranty options are non existent for repair,Other Thoughts:if you purchase a laptop from Huawei your only option for warranty service is to send it to their North American location in Texas.  You will be without your device for 7-10 days minimum.  They have no other service locations and there are no other options.  They will not send you a loaner device nor are there any partner service companies that can service your device.   Buyer beware!!!!!,1,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,2,Poor Build Quality,2019-02-22,Pros:- Looks very nice- Great keyboard,"Cons:- Seems to be a low-quality build.

Huawei,53010CAJ,3,"Gorgeous laptop, great price, not so sure about build",2019-01-20,Pros:- gorgeous (think a more 'wedge' style current MBP)- great form factor- great keys- USB-A is a great addition,Cons:- build quality leaves me with a $1500+ 'desktop' due to a non functioning screen,"Other Thoughts:After ~5 months with the MateBook X Pro Signature Edition, my laptops screen just completely went out on me.I usually use it [lid] closed connected to power, USB-C dongle, and my USB-A audio interface. I randomly remove it for flights and travel.Yesterday I open it to see a completely blank/black screen. The touch screen still works (when connected to HDMI via USB-C) but otherwise, its done. Booting to BIOS is black, POST screen is non existent, but the external display works.I've contacted Huawei in the long shot hopes of getting a fix, as this really was a fantastic machine.",3,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Fantastic Laptop for Graduate Student in Science,2018-11-24,"Pros:My review is a bit biased since this is the nicest laptop I've ever owned, but this thing is just incredible for its size and price.1) Processing speed is top-notch2) Display is crisp and very bright, which is perfect for typing or reading articles outside3) No tape over the web cam - I do not use the web camera often so this is not a problem for me as it is some people4) Ive had this laptop for 4 months and have had zero issues installing or running any software (including data analysis programs, which run very fast on this laptop)5) Decent internal storage but great speed for regularly backing-up data6) Super lightweight and durable; sleek profile7) Speakers are the best of any laptop I have used or heard8) Backlii keyboard and keyboard style make long days of typing easy9) Touch screen is great; I actually did not know this was a touch screen until after I bought it.... silly but was a pleasant surprise!10) Touchpad sensitivity is often said to be a Con, but I love how quickly I can move around the screen. I usually hook-up to multiple monitors, so it can become difficult transitioning and not using a mouse. This touchpad solves that issue","Cons:There are not many Cons for me1) Webcam angle is weird. although I dont use it often, it is a bit strange when needed2) Fan sometimes gets really loud when the computer is plugged in; not difficult to ignore though3) Wish there was an HDMI port in addition to the current USB-C and USB ports. I usually hook up to two additional screens but even with the USB-C converter sent with the laptop, this is not possible with mouse and keyboard unless the user has logitech unifying devices.Aside from these things, which really don't impact me very much, this laptop is downright amazing. Will buy Huawei again if they keep up this level of quality for price. Beats MacBooks by a mile considering the bang for you buck.",,1,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,3,"Almost, but not quite (yet)",2018-11-17,Pros:- Great screen- Great size- Great power,"Cons:- Still no option to leave backlit keyboard ON or to have it turn on when trackpad is used (it is also not the brightest)- Trackpad loose out of the box, resulting in rattling and requiring a hardware hack to try and address- Fan noise is very annoying (my XPS 13 was much quieter)","Other Thoughts:- Hoping Huawei spends the few hours to program, test and push a BIOS or software option to change the backlit keyboard settings",0,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,2,Very Good For About 3 months,2018-11-10,"Pros:Very nice battery live, Stylish and easy to handle on your hands. Screen is out of this world and Sound is just the best i ever listen to on a laptop.",Cons:Gave me the blue screen of death several times withing the first use.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop is just amazing on almost every aspects. I just have bad experience with the service. If Huawei wants to compete with Apple or Dell, they have to step up their customer services. I most to have a defective device front the beginning because i had several blue screens withing the first uses. I rebooted the PC and then it works every single time. After 3 months it did not came back on at all. The last blue crashed the PC did not recovered from it. I understand that  stuff happens some time with technology and electronic devices but when you paid $1,600 for a PC you deserved a better service. I called the Huawei and after spending 20 minutes with then over the phone they asked me to send the PC to them  so they can fix it and send it back to me. This is a work PC and I'm dead with out it. So now I have to wait Who knows for how long to get the PC back. This is just not right. If a device dyes withing the first 3 months they should just find a way to take care of the customers. Again I know that stuff happens but coming from Apple service to this is just depressing. Not a pleasant experience.",3,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,1,Dead after 3 months,2018-10-31,Pros:Was great while it lasted,"Cons:Won't boot at all after only three months. Very disappointing, worked fine one day, closed the lid...came back next day and power button does nothing.","Other Thoughts:I'll update my rating if it gets fixed, but my research so far has shown Huawei isn't great to work with. This machine may look great but have underlying issues that are starting to show, so buyer beware. No one wants to waste $1500.",4,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,4,"Laptop is good, problems getting Office 365 working",2018-10-17,Pros:Laptop and graphics look great and run very smoothly. Great value so far in terms of design and usability. Let's hope it stays that way for at least several years!,"Cons:-The ""1-Year free"" Office 365 Personal initially came deactivated. The version pre-installed on the laptop was only a 14-day trial, and it asked for payment for the full version. After some back and forth with Huawei, Newegg, and Microsoft, Microsoft agreed to provide a 1-year activation for the Office software, attached to a Microsoft user account.-Graphical interface for older apps is very messed up, sometimes unusable. Windows, icons, buttons, and installer menus on some old (pre-2011) and not-so-old apps are either teeny-tiny, or blurry and stretched, on the full 3000x2000 resolution display. This was true for Faststone image capture, Winamp, and a few other apps.-Text occasionally gets cut off on the right side of the page. Again, I believe it's an issue with the 3000x2000 display, which is a non-standard aspect ratio. While the display is very crisp and clear, Huawei really needs to update their graphics drivers to fix these problems.","Other Thoughts:-Just hope the manufacturer and seller are being honest in the product description, about whether the software is really free or just a trial version.",2,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,3,Good and bad in one device,2018-09-02,Pros:The battery life is great. Much better than my Lenovo Yoga X1 third gen. The wcreeen in very bright and sharp.,Cons:The keyboard is very shallow. Won’t let me type fast.  The plastic scratches easily. Very cheap plastic.,,2,2

I really like the..-back lit keyboard-speakers (they really do have great sound to them)-beautiful screen-ease of typing,"Cons:Gets pretty hot on the bottom when charging and using, the mouse pad can be a little over sensitive to certain touch (like it will select something I didn't intend it to at times)",Other Thoughts:This review is based on the fact that I recently bought this laptop and so I will continue to see how it goes with continual use,4,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,The MateBook X Pro is a VERY impressive laptop,2018-08-16,"Pros:The MateBook X Pro is a speedy, lightweight laptop with a gorgeous (touch) screen. I've been impressed from the very moment I removed it from the box. Fan noise hasn't been an issue at all. The fingerprint reader in the power button is stupid fast and very accurate - like this better than the Windows Hello camera on the Surface Pro. My unit came with the latest BIOS 1.12 and only had a handful of driver updates from Huawei to install. Highly recommend!","Cons:- Came with Windows 10 Home, but it's an easy upgrade to Pro for $99 - I did this primarily to enable Bitlocker drive encryption- The underside gets a bit warm at times but never hot or uncomfortable- Not to nitpick, but the power adapter plug is a strange arrangement and will block adjacent outlets on a power strip- It would be nice if there were an option to keep the backlight for the keyboard on","Other Thoughts:I've been using a Surface Pro for the last few years (Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4 and the 2017 Surface Pro - all with the keyboard cover as well as the Surface docking station setup). I recently tired the Surface Book 2 and found it to be a very nice machine but it was a bit heavy for daily travel and a little ""clunky"" for lack of a better word. I'd been eyeing the MateBook X Pro, but just wasn't sure without any experience with Huawei. Prior to purchasing the MateBook X Pro, I pored over reviews for at least two months - it was a toss up between this and the XPS 13 9370 (2018) model. Ultimately, I think Huawei has done a stellar job here and I'm certainly not missing out on anything by not going with the XPS.",7,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Matebook X Pro is the best,2018-08-14,"Pros:I have been using the Matebook X Pro for about a week now. There is nothing I don't like about the Matebook. Touchpad, screen, style, keyboard, touch screen, MX150, ports its all a A++","Cons:Many complain about the fan, but after 2 days and all windows updates, it is very quiet. Under power options, if you change the maximum CPU Processing power to 99%, you will not here the fan at all, than create an All performance power option if you want to be all out at 100%. I haven't found any cons yet.",Other Thoughts:What a price for such specs. I love it in every aspect and have been enjoying it since I received it out of the box. Huawei will take over the industry very shortly and Apple should be afraid.,2,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Amazing,2018-07-31,Pros:I love the matebook x pro.

Not really any bloatware outside of the garbage that comes with Windows (not huawei’s fault there). Really I have no complaints. Feels quality, love the solid materials and the grey feeling finish.","Cons:I really don’t consider these cons personally, because they don’t matter to me but so people know:1. The camera placement is great for privacy if you don’t use your camera (I never do so I really like this), but the angle and camera quality aren’t great if you’re a heavy webcam user or do virtual meeting stuff. Fine in a pinch, but not for frequent use.2. The ports were a bit snug at first, though a week in to my use and they’re fine now....really I can’t think of anything else....the charging brick is a bit of an odd shape and is sort of awkward?

Huawei,53010CAJ,4,Great product! not perfect yet,2018-05-30,"Pros:I bought this laptop after two months of reasearch and here are my thoughts.First of all you need to know what you're looking for in a laptop. Do you want it for hard core gaming, a mobile workstation, or an all around laptop with great mobility? For each one of these categories the specs of the desired laptop will vary.Based on this, what I was looking for was an all around laptop which is modern, good looking, great build quality, great LCD quality for photo editing, good enough battery life for a day at work, good performance occasional coding and simulation (because I mostly use my PC for this), and  maybe occasional gaming,  and all these under 1800 CAD.Here are my pros and cons for this laptop based on what was importannt for me in a laptop:Pros:-Awesome design and build quality-Great LCD and color accuracy-Good enough battery life of about 9 hours on better battery mode-relatively light and thin-Above average performance (not the best among 8550u equiped laptops)-Great value for what you get! the best price among competitors","Cons:The fan is loud when plugged in and it can get annoying to some ppl. This can be fixed by using a lower performance power plan though. I hope a bios update fixes this issue. However, the same issue is also observed in the Dell XPS, lenovo X1 carbon and all other ultra books with high performance specs.","Other Thoughts:Altough not perfect, but I would defenitely recommend this product since it is one of the best laptops you can get for this price!",1,0

Huawei,53010CAJ,4,There is still a lot of work for improvement (3rd generation MateBook X),2018-05-28,Pros:+ 3:2 aspect ratio +  Gorilla Glass touchscreen + sRGB coverage 95% + no PWM (pulse-width modulation) + narrow bezels + Thunderbolt 3 + USB 3.0 Type-A (customers request) + high quality chassis,Cons:- lack of SD card - coil whine while AC adapter plugged in - slower '1D12' variant of the GeForce MX150 - loud fan when gaming - the poor webcam position - user unfriendly ssd upgrade (under heatpipe) - soldered RAM - no pen support,"Other Thoughts:one of the best features - 3:2 screen ratio with very narrow bezels. great idea. but for lots of photographers really need sd card slot. very mixed feelings about the product. this laptop would be the winner if the company decided to add an sd card slot and two internal SD slots to it (1st ssd - os, 2nd - user files, booting could be from 1st ssd or from 2nd ssd - choosing from BIOS) and also fix the cons above",3,4
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Exactly what I was looking for,2018-05-20,Pros:- the 3:2 aspect ratio was key in my decision- touchscreen- lightweight with decent battery,Cons:- Can get quite hot but no worse then other ultrabooks i've used- webcam quality is low but I don't use it anyways- weird out of the box partitions,Other Thoughts:I do most of my work on a Desktop but on occasion need a laptop for travel. My x230t was not cutting it anymore and I was in the market for an ultrabook that was good for productivity. I ended up going with the Matebook X Pro mostly due to the 3:2 touch screen  and have not been disappointed with it since.  The only tip I have for people is  if you do reformat and re-partition make sure you install all the intel drivers from the site.  It took me a day to get the fingerprint reader to work again and it only did so installing Intel management engine drivers.,10,1

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,1,"Do Not Buy--- Defective Software, No Customer Service and Insult to Injury",2019-02-20,Pros:big screen,"Cons:Software issues on Touchpad makes a zoom feature impossible to correct.  Lenovo tech says ""no solution"" and Lenovo customer service says just change settings (um, yea, we got that, but the software isn't allowing it anymore)  geesh  Multiple complaints on the Lenovo website and Lenovo doesn't care","Other Thoughts:So....  I wrote a  review (below) to Lenovo after I was forced to return this due to Zoom driver issues (as did many other reviewers)  Their insulting response is below my review giving us a basic, elementary instruction (which obviously we tried multiple times before contacting Window and Lenovo Tech support)  Hey Lenovo, It's bad enough you wasted our time along with many others, but don't insult us further by giving us a lame reply.  Shame, shame.· 4 days agoIt's the little things that matter......like customer service and solutions to minor problems. We are returning this laptop today after only a week. There is a small problem, yet intolerable one, with the touch pad features. After two days, we were informed that it is not something that can be fixed. You cannot turn off the touchpad features that cause a zoom if the the touchpad is accessed in a certain way. I tried to find a solution to this on my own for hours. Windows did a remote session and was pretty confused as to why all of the touchpad options were missing. Windows support advised me to go to Lenovo support. Lenovo support not only did not support, they advised me to do something that would have caused more issues and then ended the chat before I could ask more questions. Next, my husband stepped in. He went through Lenovo support and finally, the truth was revealed. Due to a split between the software companies Elan and Synaptics, the annoying touchpad problem could not be corrected. I will note that my husband is the CIO of a college with over 10,000 students and also, on the Board of his state's Education CIOs. They network and they talk and the recommend. In short, Lenovo wasted many, many hours of our time and that just isn't right. A new driver should have been created for this product or Lenovo shouldn't continue to sell it... end of product line or not. As far as the rest of the details, it is lightweight with a big, bright screen, but I just can't trust the product and suspect other defects will be present. Defects in combination with the complete apathy to support means I had to replace this.Response from Lenovo:Courtnea_Lenovo  · Customer Care· 7 hours agoWelcome to our Ratings and Reviews section!Lenovo appreciates you taking the time to share your comments and concerns.

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,3,Just okay.,2019-02-19,"Pros:The price, although, you get what you pay for, and the number keypad.","Cons:The battery is awful, which I had previously read and yet wasn’t convinced, the battery cord is shorter than most, the computer is packed with products I neither want nor need and had to remove a number of programs and adjust a number of defaulted security settings. I also intermittently encounter connectivity issues with websites, which doesn’t occur with any of my other half a dozen devices. Probably most frustrating is the mousepad.

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,4,Adequate with a few quirks,2018-12-26,"Pros:Fairly thin, satisfactorily weight, screen is clear and bright.  Keyboard is easy to type on / no issues.  Touch pad is large which was one key purchasing factor for me.","Cons:Little disappointed with the touch pad - it has integrated / seamless buttons at the bottom of it.  If you're finger just rests on where the button lies you can't move the cursor (maybe an update can fix this?).  It's a tough habit to break having having real physical buttons.  I mean do you use your desktop mouse with your pointer (clicking) finger raised off the button the whole time?Unit is completely sealed - the battery is not serviceable / replaceable without taking the whole thing apart.  Essentially don't expect to upgrade anything with relative ease.Loaded with bloatware of course, junk software that you're only allowed to use as a trial then required to pay.Literally booted the machine up, ran thru Win10 setup, went to uninstall McAfee (see note above) and the system black screened on reboot and would NOT load Windows thereafter.  Had to restore from image after first reboot!  What the heck!?",Other Thoughts:I expected more performance considering a Gen 8 i5 and solid state drive.  I guess if I took this thing apart I'd find a no name china knock off SSD.  Yes its faster than a conventional drive but as far as solid state goes - its one of the slowest I've ever used.,4,1
Lenovo,81D2005CUS,1,Returned two glitchy laptops in two weeks,2018-12-20,"Pros:Fast start up, lovely design, very light weight, nice screen size.  Love the DVD/CD drive, most laptops don't even have those anymore.  Price was alright.","Cons:First laptop worked at first, but the shift key was stuck a lot. Not great because I type 100+ wpm and who needs a sticky keys window interrupting every few seconds.  Also the computer started to say ""plugged in, not charging"" a week after I purchased it.  I was told this is a rare bug, Lenovo said this is an economy mode setting, which I hadn't touched.  I returned the computer for a new one without a problem.The second computer had problems immediately when it was set up.  CPU ran anywhere from 35-70% with no programs running, it was all ""background tasks"" I couldn't kill.  The fan was so loud it started to gave me a headache and never stopped.  The fast access apps on the start menu, when deleted, came back as soon as the computer was restarted.  Any game apps that came pre-installed like Candy Crush or Minecraft had no way to delete them OR open them.  This one went back for a refund instead.","Other Thoughts:The price is okay, found better for cheaper elsewhere, and Newegg was good about the returns, but when they refunded me for the laptop, they had a 48$ ""price adjustment"" that they took off what they refunded me, and when I contacted them they said they had already sent me that part of the refund.  ...no, no they didn't, so I had to get on with customer support about that, and that was just irritating on top of the rest of the issues.The laptops had potential, but I dislike broken keys and being on with support 10 minutes after opening a box, and re-boxing to return an hour later.  Newegg was great until the 48$ wasn't returned.  Just waiting for that now.",10,0

It is simple, to the point, great.  Runs fast enough.  Blew McAfee away and tweaked services, it's snappy.  Video is pretty decent, You could probably run most games (I haven't tried them all yet) on low, which is OK by me for a laptop in this range.  I know for a fact it will run Shadows of Mordor in between low - medium at a decent fps clip.  Runs Warframe great.

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,1,"Buggy, returned Two in two weeks.",2018-12-09,"Pros:I didn't have the laptops long enough to get a really good feel for them, unfortunately.  The first laptop I received was okay, but had some bugs in it.  Everything ran decently for about a week.  Fast start up, good graphics, fast downloads, everything a casual computer person needs to do the little things like play WoW and smaller games that don't require a lot.What I really, really liked about this laptop?  CD/DVD drive.  That was *AWESOME* because I have a lot of DVD's and I know laptops in the last few years have done away with them.Newegg was great about returning the laptops.  I first exchanged it for a new one thinking ""well one time isn't unheard of.""","Cons:Pointer's fastest speed was half of what others are.  First laptop had a shift key that wouldn't work right and after a week the battery said ""plugged in, not charging"" which I was told was a rare bug.  Lenovo told me it was an ecomony mode.. but I didn't have any of that set up.  I sent it back without hassle from Newegg, so that was very nice.  (Will need to figure out how to get warranty refunded since I only had the computers for a total of a week all together...)The second laptop, however, had a LOT of problems.  Touchpad issue again, which was annoying, but first time out of the box, the fan is running like I had the computer three years in a dusty room and never shut it off.  I checked my CPU and it was bouncing from 35-70% with one small program running!  So I look deeper and there are over 100 background ""tasks"" running that every time I end them, they pop right back up and resume eating my CPU, I can't find them to delete whatever is making them, and it's not like I installed anything except the basic programs on the laptop (Discord, Firefox at the time).After both of these problems, there are *many* apps in the start menu I could not delete, could not open, and could not do anything with.  Support was no help on this and just said ""We need to look further into this issue, we'll contact you.""  Things like Candy Crush and Minecraft that... honestly, if you're going to advertise for these, at least let people uninstall the shortcut or even open them to figure out what the heck they do, because clicking on them got me no where and right clicking on them only had the ""pin to start"" option.Which brings me to my final problem.  There's the cascading walls of ""fast access"" apps on the start menu, right?  I hate them.  I unpin them as fast as I can because it's ugly and obnoxious looking.  So tech support is helping me with another issue I'm having (really great to be on with tech support 10 minutes after unboxing a brand new laptop, by the way, because of a bunch of problems...) and they reboot my computer.  ALL the ""fast access"" apps are back in my start menu.  So I unpin them again, shut the computer down, and start it back up.  ALL BACK.  AGAIN.I'm not super tech savvy in the way that some people can build computers, but the CPU thing alone with the 100+ background tasks running was enough to send up major red flags.  I contacted several of my computer geek/tech friends and they all said the same thing: There is something majorly wrong with that laptop.So, the replacement laptop is going back too, for a refund this time.  Unfortunately, for someone like me, who wants a simple sturdy brick that'll last more than a year to play video games, watch movies, and have a few other programs running at the same time, this is not even an option to consider.",,4,8

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,4,"Fast, Reasonably Priced, Reliable Brand (for me)",2018-09-27,"Pros:This is my third Lenovo laptop.  I bought this one because of the specs and price, but especially because of the reliability of the first two.The processor is very fast, coupled with the SSD and 8Gb of memory this machine runs very well.  The display is very good as well.The machine also has a wired LAN connector and a CD/DVD Drive which are getting less common on many laptops.","Cons:I've read reviews of this model where people complained about relatively low battery life, fan noise and the somewhat small SSD.  For my purposes, the battery life is not an issue as I seldom move it around for extended period of time.  I've had no fan issues either.  However, the SSD issue may be another matter.Knowing the size of the drive before I purchased the laptop, I thought that I would just store some lesser used programs and files on an SDHC card.  Upon inserting the card into the SDHC slot, I found it only goes half way in, leaving half the card exposed.  This would put the card in a precarious position which could affect performance and reliability of using it for working storage.  I had never seen a PC card slot that did not fully encompass the card.  There could not have been much savings involved in constructing the slot in this manner so I wonder why they did it.","Other Thoughts:I feel this is a well built machine, especially for the money.  While it has a few shortcomings, they aren't that significant for me and I would definitely recommend this machine.Also, for what I believe is the first time ever for a New Egg order, the package arrived 2 day earlier than scheduled.",7,2
Lenovo,81D2005CUS,4,"Good computer, some things could be improved",2018-09-19,"Pros:- Seems to working well so far. Everything is smooth, and I previously installed the Witcher 3 on this computer. It ran at almost 30 fps on low and 720p, and was smooth.- Keyboard is nice and quiet, and easy to type with. I like it.- display is 1080p which looks pretty nice in my opinion.- Cover and exterior looks pretty neat.- computer is pretty light- SSD runs very fast.","Cons:- Battery life. It can last the entire school day without dying, if I lock it or put it to sleep most of the time.- Battery life again. DO NOT USE BATTERY SAVER. IT MADE MY BATTERY GO DOWN 2 PERCENT IN A MINUTE.- It whirs audibly and I don't really have a problem with the sound, but some people may not like it.- When running simple applications like microsoft word and using bluetooth, battery goes down fairly quickly.- Space is too small. If it also came with a 500gb hard drive along with the 256gb SSD, it would be better in my opinion.","Other Thoughts:- I would recommend it, if you aren't looking for long battery life. It is pretty good for its price- I most likely would not buy it again, unless the battery was better.- If there was something about the product I would change, it would be the battery, and maybe the small amount of space. Most people don't need too much space but if you are into gaming or downloading movies, 256 GB isn't big enough.",6,2

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,5,Great bang for buck!,2018-08-31,"Pros:- Ryzen 2500U is a great CPU, 4c/8t and an awesome integrated GPU with Vega 8- Dual Channel DDR4 2400 RAM- Little bloatware (McAfee)- Solid build quality for price segment, the plastic looks metallic- Can game very well, beats the balls off Intel HD graphics- 256GB SSD in this price range is insane perf/$ for storage","Cons:- TN panel is meh quality, but that's really to be expected for price range- Don't even touch the Intel i5 options, you get similar CPU performance and terrible graphics performance","Other Thoughts:- When gaming, make sure you configure the Windows Power profile, reduce CPU to 50-75% max to give more power to Vega 8 so it can boost its clocks way high for 10-20% extra performance.",18,1

Lenovo,81D2005CUS,4,Nice Machine for the Money,2018-07-28,"Pros:So just writing about the hardware, everything seems to work, which is of course expected, but it doesn't always happen. Its thin, about 4 1/2 lbs and gives a bright enough display, though for me at least, the display has to be set at 100% in a normally lit room. Speakers are on the tinny side, with little bass but certainly loud and clear enough. Start up is very quick (less than 10 sec) with the i5 cpu and the 256 Gb  Samsung SSD. And the machine is quiet. Having two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 3.1 c port is very good. One can purchase a USB 3.0 adapter at a small price if the USB 3.1 c port is not needed and one wants to have a third USB 3.0 port available.It took me a little time to get the hang of the touchpad to use the mouse consistently, but once I got some practice I found using the trackpad mouse has been fine. Using the keyboard on this machine is a highlight to me. Finger contact with the keys is easy but strong enough to give a nice feeling in use. Of the three laptops I've used in the last fifteen years this is my favorite, especially for using the keyboard.Taking a look at a couple YouTube videos of similar Lenovo models had me feeling confident that upgrading to a larger SSD in the future and cleaning the fan of dust build up would be relatively easy along with eventual battery replacement because of the straight forward disassembly of the bottom and easy access to those parts.","Cons:The wifi device on this Lenovo is 8.02.11 ac only.  Lenovo could have made this laptop more versatile had they used a dual band wifi device. In my own situation our router is broadcasting at 8.02.11 b g/n, so I use a small USB wifi adapter in the laptop that picks up that protocol to get around the issue.There is no hdd activity light on the computer.  To me, at least, I use that light as a key marker for the progress of activities and wish there were one as on previous laptops I've owned. That missing light is something I've always resented macs for not having.Although I have not run the battery all the way down at this point at one sitting it appears I can get a couple hours of use out of it at most before needing to recharge.","Other Thoughts:I bought a Lenovo laptop for my daughter about 7 years ago that still runs fine, though a bit slow for today's applications. Hopefully build quality is still as good if not better.",8,5
Lenovo,81D2005CUS,5,Better than average laptop,2018-07-13,Pros:Lenovo brand name. Samsung SSD. Optical drive. 10-key. Runs quiet. Smooth. Virtually no bloatware!,"Cons:It does not look like you can replace the SSD without taking the entire bottom casing apart. One day I might try but for now, I'll have to manage with 256GB.","Other Thoughts:I removed the factory partition that was taking up 25GB of space. The display is OK...for the price it's acceptable. For about $100-150 more, I could've got a better screen.  Battery life is OK.",4,0
Lenovo,81D2005CUS,5,Exactly what I expected,2018-07-04,Pros:- Good internals- Fast- Good keyboard- Decent screen (what is expected from a TN panel)- Rigid build (even if built with plastic),Cons:- Limited battery life,,4,0
Lenovo,81D2005CUS,5,Great laptop for what it was created to do.,2018-06-10,"Pros:This laptop performs excellently. the quad core processor combined with the SSD allow for quick load times on most applications. The casing itself is pretty solid. Even if it is not aluminum it seems sturdy enough with an appropriate amount of flexibility on the screen so that it isn't too susceptible to breaking. The tile style keys are well made, they have a very satisfying tactile response that is great for typing. The screen's brightness is really good, but it's not extremely reflective like a macbook, so there is far less of an issue with glaring. Having a disc drive and SD card slot are great for anyone who wants to watch media on the laptop separate from the internet Up to this point the power cable feels extremely secure in its port and takes effort to remove, which is a bonus if you're using it somewhere where it may be jostled around. On that same note, having an SSD instead of an HDD is great for preserving your data against damage from vibration. Having a laptop with a number pad is also very convenient for someone who needs to do calculations and input data. The speakers are about your average laptop quality, except for that they are able to surpass many that I have had experience with in terms of sheer volume.","Cons:The only downside that I feel isn't a result of getting the laptop cheaper than the more expensive options is the location of the track pad. While I do understand the idea of putting the track pad directly below the space bar instead of dead center, I often have issue left clicking when I'm not looking at the track pad because it takes a very conscious effort to reach that side of the trackpad.",,18,0

Lenovo,T430,5,Best Bang For Your Buck,2019-01-21,Pros:-Cheap-Came WIth Upgraded CPU,Cons:-Have To Buy A New Charger Because of CPU,"Other Thoughts:Bought one of these because I wanted to tinker around upgrading a ThinkPad. I thought I was going to to receive a bare-bones T430, but after a couple days of messing with it, I realized that the processor was a i7 3720QM...AND the laptop had the dedicated GPU. Was not expecting that at all, so at the price these refurbished T430s are going for, I feel like I got a steal. Only problem is that the supplied 65W doesn't have enough juice to power the GPU, and beefier CPU so it only charges in sleep mode. Not a big deal, just going to buy a higher rated power supply. After I drop a SSD in this machine, it's going to be blazin' fast for a computer manufactured in 2012.As far as it being a refurb, I can't tell. Like the other reviewers said, it looks new to me...besides a blemish in the LCD panel, but it's not enough to distract. This T430 is my new favorite machine.",0,0

Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),2,Poor Motherboard Reliability,2017-04-16,"Pros:-mSATA port, allows SSD installation along with the 2.5 inch SATA regular hard drive.-Good price, fine when it worked.","Cons:-Poor wifi connectivity; there was a class action lawsuit around 2014.-Poor motherboard reliability. Failed after 3 years, with a significant number of similar gripes online.-Motherboard failure essentially totals the computer.-Not designed to be disassembled; expect to fight with the backplate. It's an ultrabook.","Other Thoughts:This review is for Lenovo's U310 laptops in general, not any particular seller.I purchased a U310 in 2013 and was pleased until it suffered a severe material failure in 2016. On researching the issue, it appears that a not insignificant number of people have experienced the same issue, stemming from poor quality control and poor parts.The laptop will stop booting up. A few lights will show, but there will be no screen or external screen indications. Common troubleshooting is testing the RAM, Hard Drive etc. Everything pointed to a failed motherboard. I don't expect computers to be perfect, and I expect a small amount of tinkering, BUT when a major component under very light use that has been kept indoors in moderate temperatures and not exposed to dust, moisture etc fails on a significant number of laptops...Lenovo has some issues. Other failed components are replaceable, but a failed motherboard essentially totals this computer.I've had a great experience with a 2011 Lenovo Y470 laptop, but I'd be very hesitant to use Lenovo in the future without significant research. The U310 series had major wireless issues, along with this poor motherboard durability issue. When I purchase a computer, I expect it to last until becomes obsolete, not fail after an extended 'rental' period.",0,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),4,Almost everything you hoped for,2013-12-27,Pros:A solid laptop with an above average processor and an average amount of RAM. Touchscreen was extremely responsive. Pretty cheap for an ultrabook.,"Cons:It does come with bloatware, which is to be expected from most companies. You can clear this up by ""cleanbooting"" it. It does also have a wifi configuration, which can be fixed by googling the laptop model and the term ""wifi problems"" Update it to Windows 8.1 and it should get smoother in terms of running.  Lenovo's tech support could be better, but the online community does a great job of handling it.","Other Thoughts:A lot of bad reviews on here are made by people who don't understand laptops or the basis that people buy computers. Most people, especially tech savvy ones won't try to modify laptops hardware wise without first giving it a professional check.  The bad reviews spawn from amateurs who didn't know what they're doing.",0,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),3,Re-Review: OS now on the SSD,2013-04-19,"Pros:(Now that the OS is on the SSD, and I've had a little more in-depth experience with the laptop as a whole, I believe a whole new review is reasonable. It's up to Newegg to post it. My older review is under the nickname ""Incubus"".)- Laptop boots up before the Windows symbol can even finish it's animation.- Pretty much anything that involves software installed to the SSD boots up without even having to think about it, snap, just like that.- Light-weight, exceeds in the mobility factor.- LCD is nice and beautiful, everything looks slick and great.- With the disc drive (D:) clear of all OS-related junk, all 465GB are free to fill to my heart's content. Yaay :D","Cons:- Trackpad is still kinda weird, it has this thing I don't like where the LMB and RMB are also touch-sensitive to the cursor. Without practice, clicking around will be seriously annoying in the beginning. Before when I said it was overly-sensitive, that was more of a Chrome issue than anything, I don't have that issue with Mozilla.- I seriously wish I had checked if it had a light-up keyboard before I bought it, this laptop could really use it. And Bluetooth! Oh how I wish it had crossed my mind!- It's a one-piece, no access to the RAM, HDD, and battery. Big slap-in-the-face for those who have experience opening up laptops and messing around.- Don't be fooled by the idea that it has a decent battery life.... it doesn't.....- Graphics integrated into the CPU, gaming even at lowest settings is a pretty lame experience. I've only tried DotA2 so far. Also be sure to never install a game onto the SSD, my friendly advice.- For some reason, when you wake the laptop up, putting in your password stalls for a few rather long seconds. You get over it, but it's still a con. Definitely bites a chunk out of the OS-on-SSD pro, or maybe it has nothing to do with that, no idea.- The bloatware is pretty rancid. I tried to get rid of most, but apparently if I get rid of them all, bad things will happen?Speaking of bloatware, I am afraid to uninstall this ""Lenovo Smart Update"", even though it takes up the MOST memory of all background programs, and I still can't figure out what in the heck it actually does, even when I google it.- Audio is utter trash. Audio drivers are worse. The speakers are whatever, but there's only one plug-in for headphones, and the symbol suggests it'll take headphones with built-in microphones, but no dedicated microphone slot. With typical earbuds, audio is average, but don't you DARE try plugging in professional studio headphones! You've been warned.- It's generally agreed that Windows 7 HP 64bit is max 20gb of space. With a 32gb SSD, I thought I'd have plenty of room for more. But then the updates came and took a bunch of space. I'm left with 2.82gb as I write this (including all other software I installed), so I have to be on watch, cleaning up w/ CCleaner, uninstalling as many useless-looking things as I can. I have to check on the SSD every few hours, because it just changes out of nowhere to a bigger or smaller number, it's ridiculous.- ATTENTION: There are random places on the planet where Wi-Fi is just plain impossible to get. I'm typing this about 50 yards away from a room in the building where the Wi-Fi refuses to connect. Insult to injury, I had a Mac laptop sitting right next to it that connected just fine. Where I am sitting now, it works. Apparently this is an issue with the Wi-Fi card that they worked out last year, started building new models with working Wi-Fi cards, but continued to sell the old models to customers. Apparently I am one of the unfortunates who ended up with one of the old model.","Other Thoughts:As I mentioned before, I tried to install Windows 7 on the SSD myself. Hint: Don't do it. If you want the OS on the SSD, you have to try to convince Lenovo to do it for you. I managed to, after the hard drive and OS basically bricked and they accepted to do it through warranty, making a faulty hard-drive replacement claim when I explained to them that attempting to re-install the OS through alternatives methods showed no sign of any of my drives, ever, at all. I sent it in, they sent it back.When I got it, the disc drive got bigger (from 420gb to 450gb), but THEY DIDN'T INSTALL THE OS ON THE SSD! Also the folder for the drivers was nowhere to be found, when it was originally what came on the SSD. It was just empty this time, so I assumed I had no drivers. I decided to give up on the OS-SSD thing and I installed the drivers online. Every single one gave me an error message. I called Lenovo, they sent me a set of discs that would re-install everything, OS, drivers, etc. The installation stopped at the second disc, and never continued. Result? No more OS, everything wiped completely.This time I called and raged at them, threatening to find a way to get all of my money back if they didn't fix everything this time, complete with drivers, OS on the SSD, everything to my satisfaction. The first call I made, the entire Lenovo department was ""down"", and the woman I talked to couldn't help me to save her own life. But eventually I ended up on the phone with someone who helped me fix everything, including this little problem where the warranty claimed to end in August, even though I bought it in December, and that error wasn't fixed for MONTHS! I sent it in, they sent it back. And the OS was on the SSD. Glory to the hypno-toad. AND my disc drive went from 450gb to 465gb. Awesome :P Turns out the drivers are all installed in the Program Files folders of the C drive..... Oh well, at least my OS is finally on the SSD.BUT NOW I'm having this Wi-Fi card issue, and I learned online that they acknowledged this issue last year, and were fixing it. I seriously wish I had read this looooong before all of this, and apparently I would be solely to blame for not bringing this up during all these back and forth shipments, but I didn't know, so... blah. NOW I HAVE TO SEND IT IN AGAIN SO THEY CAN FIX THE WI-FI CARD, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE HELL ELSE THEY'LL END UP DOING TO IT!!!(I tried to ask if they could give me a Wi-Fi card that goes to 1000Mbps to make up for all I've been through. Apparently it doesn't work like that. Lame.)Bottom line, it's an okay laptop. It's just.... a laptop. I can hardly even call it an Ultrabook. I bought this when it was $750. Then it dropped down to $500 afterwards. Lovely. It's not too hard to figure out why, either. I strongly recommend you not buy it, at all. I don't know much about the U410, but apparently it has the same issues, plus dedicated graphics. Also dropped to $500? Yeah..... keep shopping.",1,0

Works wonderful for this type of usage, though most likely disadvantageous for gaming.It is an ultrabook, which means there's no CD-RW/DVD-R/W Drive . If you need to clean install an OS like Windows 8, it is recommended to put the installation files on a bootable USB drive.One other note: by default, the storage drives are configured in a RAID setup. When I was trying to install Windows 8, the installer was not able to detect the drives as a result. I had to go to the BIOS and change the storage setup from RAID to AHCI. This will cause bluescreens when trying to load the preloaded installation of Windows but will allow the Windows 8 installer to detect the drives and format accordingly.

Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),4,Good Cheap Ultrabook,2013-01-26,"Pros:The machine is designed as a low end ultrabook and with a little bit of effort, it can be a very fast machine. I increased the RAM to 8GB and upgraded to Windows 8PRO to boot up from the SSD. It is worth taking the time to format all the drives and reinstall the OS on the SSD and leave the hard drive for files.I have had some minor issues with quality but at this prices, it is superbly fast, quiet and very easy to work with almost anywhere. Granted it does have a wireless signal issue but I see it as a minor incovenience.","Cons:The hinges fitting on my machine is a little bit off and the lid catches on the left side when I open it. At this point, it is not worth hassling with since the machine is finally configured the way I want it.","Other Thoughts:I am a road warrior with chronic fatigue issues and needed a fairly high speed laptop with adequate storage and also weigh as little as possible. This has been a life saver for me in an excellent combination of weight, cost and performance options.",0,0

Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),2,wireless is junk,2013-01-25,Pros:It's a nice looking laptop. Nice finish on the exterior lid.,"Cons:As others have stated. Wireless is junk don't think there is any solutions, I'm using a USB wifi adapter in it's place.The keyboard has flex when typing. The trackpad is alright but clicking feels cheap. The keyboard/trackpad area doesn't match the nice finish of the lid.Glossy Display if that is a concern.",Other Thoughts:For $450(how much i paid) it's good value if you can look pass the wireless issue.2 eggs for the wireless fail.,0,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),3,There's A Reason it's on Sale...,2013-01-24,"Pros:- Looks nice.  Basic but sleek metallic design, resembles a macbook actually (especially black keyboard keys on silver inside)- 2x USB 3.0 ports with good transfer speeds (SuperTalent 32GB gets ~109MBps on multi-gigabyte file copies)- i3-based laptop under $500 (as of this review)","Cons:- Wifi is useless.  See other thoughts.- Trackpad is mediocre, as stated in other reviews.  Make the buttons a separate piece of plastic from the actual touchpad and it wouldn't be so bad... silly Lenovo. And no, this isn't like a Macbook where the whole pad pushes in;  you're literally bending the edge of the plastic pad to click the left and right mouse buttons.","Other Thoughts:There is a 68-page thread on Lenovo's official forum regarding the Wifi issue.  They refuse to publicly release their fix, which is hardware-based; they insist on having customers send it in.  Even then, many customers who sent it in for service report no improvement in wifi when they get their unit back.  I believe the problem is the antenna design, possibly related to the metal case... it can't be the Wifi card itself, since Intel, Broadcom AND Atheros cards were used and all exhibit poor range and speed issues.My old Lenovo Y550P gets great speed with my Asus RT-AC66U router... however the best this U310 has done is to connect at a link rate of 48Mbps.  Bottlenecks my Comcast blast 50Mbps download speeds to 13Mbps... if I'm right next to the router.  8Mbps in the next room.Note the lowercase ""b"" i'm using... mega-BITS per second.  Not mega-bytes.   13Mbps =  1.63MBps.If you're buying an ultrabook, you likely want to have something you can carry with you and hop on wifi hotspots, etc.  Therefore, bad wifi is kind of a dealbreaker :(  Even at the sub-$500 price I got this for, I'm going to return it.  Disappointing, because aside from Wifi this is a nice little machine.  If you're willing to plug a  $20 3rd-party dongle in one of the USB ports and do it that way, then go for it.  Thi",2,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),1,I cannot discourage you enough,2013-01-22,"Pros:Lower half of the laptop looks great. Touchpad is responsive enough, albeit clunky feeling. Runs WoW and Diablo 3 at low settings very smoothly even at the same time! I don't use it primarily for gaming, but it's nice to have the option if I'm on the go or in bed.","Cons:I got mine on Black Friday 201. I don't have trouble connecting to the wifi at home, but the range is very short-- I can't use it in the kitchen in my house, though there are other computers there on the same wifi. Whenever I take it anywhere, setting up a new wireless connection is a royal pain in the buns. Easily an hour of clicking this and that, rebooting the computer, rebooting the router, messing with misc settings and suddenly it works for no reason.Viewing angle is just awful. I lean it back as far as it will and look up at the bottom of the screen, I find that to make it look tolerable. I regret buying it.Not to mention the bezel around the monitor looks like a car ran it over. I resist the urge to take sandpaper to it or remove it completely. What a joke! Cheapest plastic bezel I have ever seen on any laptop, monitor, or TV. It's easily uglier than even the crappiest bezel you've ever seen on any budget brand TV at target or walmart, past or present. Frankly, it's embarrassing to have someone else even look at my computer, which is a shame because the lower half looks pretty great.","Other Thoughts:Like I said in the title, I cannot discourage someone enough to avoid this. I wanted so badly to like it, and I waited too long and missed my return window. Didn't buy it from Newegg, bought it from Lenovo directly.",0,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),5,4.5/5; Rounding Up.,2013-01-21,"Pros:I give it a 4.5/5, and am Rounding up.-Low Price Ultrabook-Good Price for Specs compared to Competing Names.-My favorite looking ultrabook, with the exception of maybe Zenbook Prime's.-Win 7 (if you prefer 7 to 8, as I do)","Cons:-Does Come With Bloatware-Not Easily Upgradable.-Boots to HDD, not that big of a deal.-Horrible Trackpad, but after a month of using it, it is manageable.","Other Thoughts:Don't listen to the other reviews, not trying to be rude by the people reviewing them are acting like 5 year olds. This is a $450 (at time of writing) Ultrabook, you can't knock it down to one star for bloatware you knew would be there (and is removable). The only reason I put it down to 4 stars is because the fact that its not easily upgradable and the Trackpad is worse than my old laptop for years ago.I am very pleased with this Ultrabook, and I'm no ""noob"" to technology, I would have easily given it 5/5 if the trackpad was a little bit better.",1,1
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),5,"Excellent, virtually no problems",2013-01-16,Pros:I got this machine as a portable coding device. I installed linux on the SSD and kept windows on the HD (though I almost never use it). Ubuntu seems to play nicely will all of the hardware.,"Cons:The only complaint I have in the slightest about this machine is that the buttons on the mousepad are also able to move the mouse. To elaborate, there is the rectangle that is the mousepad, and all of it is sensitive to moving the mouse. So when you click, the mouse also moves a little bit. In general this doesn't really affect anything, but it takes some getting used to. Usually the mouse moves a few pixels when you click. Really a minor, minor complaint.",Other Thoughts:Absolutely excellent for what I use it for. Seems pretty sturdy and the everything works great.,1,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),2,Gigantic Mistake,2012-12-21,Pros:- Light-weight- Nice screen- Decently fast boot-up,"Cons:- No back-light on keyboard- Mousepad is overly-sensitive, one slip of the fingers and suddenly the text on Chrome is either microscopic or bigger than the screen- OS is not installed on the SSD- Bloatware is overkill-THE ENTIRE LAPTOP IS ONE PIECE. IF YOU HAVE PLANS TO GET INSIDE OF THE LAPTOP, TOO BAD.","Other Thoughts:I tried to do a fresh install of Windows 7 onto the SSD and clean out everything on the drives. The first time, the setup just crashed and left me with a boot-up screen that asks if I want to start my computer with ""Windows Setup"" or ""Windows 7"". I am basically stuck with this until I call Lenovo and ask them if they'll do anything to fix it. Every single attempt that I made to reinstall through the BIOS showed that there were no drives. At all. They disappeared every single time I tried anything at all.If you are techy in any way whatsoever at all, this laptop will be an insult to your intelligence. This laptop is for Apple-lovers who don't know what they're doing with their laptops and don't care. That is all.",4,1
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),5,Solid Ultrabook for Ubuntu,2012-11-18,"Pros:Slim form factor, light weight, fast booting SSD, large platter drive, decent keyboard, good battery life","Cons:Stock Windows 7 install is full of bloat, speakers are mediocre, keyboard isn't the ""legendary"" Lenovo.  Trackpad isn't great, but I'm hoping it will break in with time.","Other Thoughts:I got the U310 to use as a dedicated Linux laptop; the stock Win 7 install was every bit as full of bloatware as the others say, but that was immediately formatted (if I do install Windows it will be a fully clean install wiht only the minimal device drivers needed).For Ubuntu the machine had to be fully shut down (no Intel Rapid Start stuff), and in BIOS I had to disable iRST (Intel Rapid Start) and switch the drives over to AHCI.From there Ubuntu 12.10 installed with no issues (I used the Windows LiLi USB Creator to copy an ISO to a USB key); all devices are recognized and no extra drivers were needed.  The machine is very quick; I used the SSD for the main root and swap partitions, with the platter drive mounted as /home.  A full startup, including BIOS time, is < 15 seconds--however Standby works very well by closing the lid, so typical wake-up time is only a couple seconds.The machine is very responsive with Linux; I'm running a full GNOME-3 desktop, with several services (such as mongodb, apache2, mysql, and solr) in the background, and it remains very quick with IDEs and browsers galore open.Overall I'm VERY happy with this machine for Linux; it's very convienient, powerful enough to do a day's work on, has solid battery life, and is comfortable to work on.",4,0
Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),1,"Decent build, awful company. Buy another laptop",2012-11-14,Pros:CheapAesthetically pleasing,Cons:Full of bugs.Hard drive is non-standard size (this means no SSD upgrade ladies and gents)Full of bloatware.Precariously configured.Lenovo could care less about their customers (no support at all).,"Other Thoughts:Assuming your order an Ideapad U310, the first thing you'll notice is the bloatware, or ""worthless software that gets in the way"" in laymen's terms. This in itself isn't terrible, in fact it's fairly standard -- the issues come when you attempt to get rid of the bloatware and find that the machine becomes tremendously unstable.After cleaning my U310 out of the trash software Lenovo shipped with it, Intel Fast Boot stopped working, then the wifi, and everything associated with it (Widi, etc). I Didn't think this was a huge deal either, just go get the drivers from Lenovo and re-install the hardware which stopped working. Nope, Lenovo is such a crud company that their drivers don't even work. Which means unless you want to tiptoe around the aweful software that comes with the computer, you're going to lose some of your laptops functionality, like wifi (and who needs internet?)Also, if you're planning on installing Windows 8, or upgrading the drive to a full fledged SSD then you're in for a nasty surprise.Windows 8 won't install without tinkering with the partitions, and there's a bug where if you change up the partitions without changing some BIOS settings you can PERMANENTLY LOSE ACCESS to BIOS. Don't believe me? Google it. It's disgusting.If and when you do get Windows 8 installed you'll find that Lenovo's Windows 8 drivers just don't work. I rolled back to Windows 7 because of it. Also, Lenovo's Windows 7 drivers don't work on a fresh install of Windows 7 -- so no wifi until you're at least upgraded to Service Pack one.HDD is ""slim"" -- so you'll have to some surgery to get a 2.5"" SSD in there. Most people probably aren't into that.Through all this, there is NO support from Lenovo whatsoever, they'll simply tell you it's either A) Not their problem, or B) they'll ask you to send it in and so they can get it back to you a month later with all the bloatware put back onto it.DON'T.

Lenovo,U310 (43752CU),4,Good For The Price,2012-11-05,"Pros:-At $600 this is a pretty good deal for a sleek looking laptop!-After installing the latest Ubuntu on the SSD, this laptop is blazing fast. BIOS to Login screen in 2-3 seconds, wakes from hibernate even quicker.-Looks/built like a mac. Don't get me wrong, I am the antithesis of an apple fanboy, but you have to admit they do know how to make things look good. There is no shame in taking a few tips from your compitition.-You can F1-F12 from being fancy volume adjust keys to regular function keys in the BIOS. That is super nice.","Cons:-The WiFi. I have noticed that it is very directionally sensitive. For example, I can be connected at 40%, rotate the laptop 15 degrees, and jump to 90%. It gets annoying after awhile, but has yet to affect my work to a major degree.-The keyboard does not have as much stiffness and feedback as I would like, but that is personal preference.-Default install of windows has Bloatware for days. Dear Laptop Manufacturers, PLEASE STOP DOING THIS. NO ONE LIKES IT. /rant-The trackpad is a bit off, and I notice myself accidently right or left clicking when trying to scroll or zoom.","Other Thoughts:I use this laptop for writing code, taking notes in class, and generic CS Major stuff. Works well so far. Have yet to bottleneck myself for these kind of tasks.I was kind of angry that installing another OS voids the warranty. That is by far the biggest load of b***s*** that any company can do. I understand they are trying to cover themselves legally, but its 2012.

The pros outweigh the cons. The fact that I was getting an almost ultrabook design with the latest Intel processor and hardware designed to support the gesture controls on Windows 8 was enough to choose this laptop.I got the laptop as advertised and in 3 business days. The packing was perfect. The operating systems works great and is really snappy. Its gonna be better on windows 8 for sure. But I don't know why the OS is not installed on the SSD. But still it works just great.The only points I felt were compromised were the construction under the shell which is plastic unlike the aluminium top and bottom. I guess they had to do it for the price point. But nevertheless it feels sturdy. Battery could have been better. I get around 4-5 hours on normal surfing, word processing and video watching.Overall Lenovo has made a great product for the price and I would recommend this very much indeed.

With a 32GB SSD and a 500GB HDD I assumed that the OS would be on the solid state.  The ultrabook's pretty fast regardless, though- The touchpad stopped responding after 2 days of use, which is why I'm rating this so poorly.

Not an ultrabook *see below.,Cons:Not for graphically intense gaming.,"Other Thoughts:I got this for my wife to replace a dying HP.As soon as I got it home, I opened it up and took out the hard drive and replaced it with a 120 gig ssd. I loaded windows 7 professional and office as well. I didn't upgrade the ram as she does not need it for now but the 4 gig can be swapped with a single 8 gig. I enabled compression on the ssd (Corsair) since an ssd drive is so fast it does not have nearly the hit that you would have on an optical drive (in this case nearly none). Also, because the seek and load times are so fast, it nearly negates the need for an I-5 processor.This is why the Pro for not being an ultrabook. This has a regular 2.5 inch hard drive and  regular so-ddim ram (not soldered onto the motherboard).Now she has a very light notebook with no spinning drive and great battery life. It is small and light enough that she can toss it in her book bag with enough battery life that she does not have to pack her charger. It is far lighter than my Think Pad.If you do mostly web surfing and document work and you want something that is very portable with long battery life and don't want to blow the budget, this is a great way to go.",6,2

Most people won't need to upgrade, but the option is nice to have.","Other Thoughts:- Battery life is good, but not fantastic; heavy use throughout the day would require you to use the charger. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as I consider myself a power user.

Solid metal alloy frame. Nice touchscreen. Nice chiclet backlit, spill-resistant keyboard. Upward facing speakers with ample volume. 14"" screen while well under 4 lbs. I would definitely purchase again.Considering what happened to the last laptop, we also purchased the ipearl mcover for the Honor Magicbook 14, which fit perfectly. There was no cover specifically for the Huawei Matebook D 14, but the Magicbook has exactly the same dimensions.",3,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Simply the best all round laptop at this price point.  Amazing!,2019-01-12,"Pros:I'm writing this review on my new MateBook D 14.  I have been looking for a new ultrabook for months and months now and didn't want to break the bank.  Well with this laptop it's a win/win.  On sale at $529 and even at the $550 price this is a no brainer if you are looking for something for productivity and a little gaming.  The Vega Graphics pummel the intel integrated offering and the Ryzen 5, 4 cores and 8 threads even outperform the intel i5 8th gen on some work loads.  The M.2 SSD is easily upgraded if needed.  The battery life so far has been far more than I expected.  The finish and feel of this laptop is solid.  And I was shocked to see there is no irritating bloatware installed.  The only manufacture application is called the PC Manager and it is actually nice to check for driver updates.  Even the SSD partitions are sized to maximize the space on the SSD.  No over the top recovery partition that is sized too big which will waste usable space.The first time startup was clean... I did end up downloading the Windows media creation tool so I would get the latest 1809 built of Windows 10.  No issues with the update as expected.Unless you need the GPU power of  an Nvidia MX150, I just can't see paying the extra $$$ for the Intel platform and the Nvidia graphics?  Another $200-$300 I think?  Not sure if that is an option in this series of laptop.I'm shocked at how cool this runs too.  And for that matter, the screen at 1080p is really nice.  At this size of screen, I don't think you get a huge benefit to jump to 2k or 4k for that matter.  It's designed for productivity with the opportunity to so some gaming on the side.  I'm happy with the 1920x1080 resolution.  Oh, and it's touch screen.  I forgot about the touch screen until after I had everything setup.  I likely won't use the touch screen much, but then again, it's there if you need it.All in all, I'm still shocked at how nice this laptop presents itself.  Down right solid and the finish is beautiful.  As I mentioned earlier, you can't go wrong here at the price point.","Cons:Not sure if this is much of a con, but my last laptop had external volume buttons on the edge... I do kind of miss that, but not worries on getting used to the Windows Key + FKey volume up and down combination.",Other Thoughts:There is a reason that the early reviews of this laptop are a solid stars... they are well deserved!,2,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Absolutely AMAZING,2019-01-11,"Pros:Super premium build quality (just feels AWESOME to hold)Great keyboard feel (very easy to type fast and accurate)Backlit keyboardLOUD speakers!Thin bezel!Webcam on top!Great battery life! (7-10hrs)Screen is very nice and clear ( colors are great and awesome viewing angles)It's down right gorgeous!Feels like a lighter n thinner macbook pro while performing way better than the macbook air and a quarter the priceAwesome USB-C charging (the charger outputs 5v, 9v, 12v, 15v, and 20v so it can fastcharge ur galaxy phones and all other usb-c electronics!)Best built laptop you can buy under $1200 (compared to non-huawei brands)NO SCREEN FLEX!!!This has definitely boosted my productivity by 2X",Cons:It says it has fingerprint scanner but that's on the other type of matebook Ds (but it really doesn't matter because of how awesome all the other stuff is)Power button is placed on the right side right where I like to pick up my laptop with one hand so I will sometimes turn it off.NOTHING OTHER THAN THAT,"Other Thoughts:I usually buy thin n light gaming laptops (usually over $1800) because I don't see why I should buy an underpowered ultrabook for near $1400. Those gaming laptops always had terribly weak speakers, trackpads, screen flex, and not-so-great screens. This laptop is well worth the money plus some. If I were to price this laptop, I would put it around $1000 (almost twice what I paid for this!)",0,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,US Contraband,2018-12-28,"Pros:Let's face it, there is everything to like about this laptop and no cons. Feels like a premium machine for half the price. I came from a HP Spectre i7500u that didn't have as good a display (bright and crisp), or as good as GPU. I mostly casually game and write, and this computer does both flawlessly. The keyboard is one of the best I've ever used, and the track pad is extremely responsive. Build is extremely sturdy and even though it looks like a MacBook, it's charming in it's own regard. It's also a touch screen, although I could go without it. System is snappy and fast, feels like I have double the RAM even though it's only 8 GB. Extremely satisfied with this laptop, as the hunt has been going for almost a year now and I'm finally very satisfied. I was gaming League and accidentally wasn't plugged in, noticed it about 2 - 3 hours in and still had an hour left on charge. I was skeptical about this laptop but it has exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more pleased. Even the windows 10 is minimal bloatware. Zero driver issues which I was worried about with AMD.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Apparently the US is warning consumers of this brand and Trump is trying to ban them out of the US. I support any brand that delivers quality goods.,9,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,"Great computer, with some false advertising.",2018-12-28,"Pros:This laptop is basically a Windows Macbook. It has a great aluminum body, great keyboard, beautiful screen (my one definite requirement in a laptop, since I work in graphic design), fast SSD, and a surprisingly good processor. My main use for this laptop will be connecting via remote desktop to my beast of a desktop, and for that purpose, this well exceeds my expectations for the price range. It's nearly a blatant copy of a Macbook, honestly (without the Huawei branding, you'd think it was an Apple), except it runs Windows and has a touchscreen, but if you don't mind the copycat aspect of it, it's wonderful.","Cons:I mentioned false advertising, because the product page says this ships with a fingerprint sensor, but Windows tells me this device does not have one. So, I'm not sure whether it just has one that strangely isn't compatible with the operating system it ships with, or just that it doesn't have one, but I was really looking forward to the fingerprint sensor. I have a Huawei phone, and the fingerprint sensor on that is really phenomenal, so again, I was really looking forward to having that here. But hey, it also said it wasn't a touch screen, and it came with one, so I won't complain too loudly.","Other Thoughts:All in all, this is an really good bargain for what you're getting, and while I'm severely disappointed that I was promised a fingerprint sensor and didn't get one, I cannot in good faith give this laptop less than 5 stars.",1,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,"So far, amazing, but got touchscreen instead of non-touchscreen with Ryzen 2500U",2018-10-30,"Pros:- Beautiful- Fast SSD- Matched or surpassed all of my specs and price point criteria: ~$600, 8GB RAM, 8th gen intel or comparable Ryzen (which I got), 256 GB SSD, colorful bright screen, decent keyboard, precision touchpad, 13-15"" screen- Has front facing speakers- The F row of keys, like a macbook, by default do functions like volume or screen brightness instead of the F keys, which is super nice. the Fn key turns them ""back"" into F1-F12, similar to a macbook- Screen rotates until it is flat with keyboard, which is really nice- strong, solid hinge, screen doesnt wobble at all when typing.- Full size HDMI port is awesome, as is the connectivity vs a macbook- Minimal bloatware, just one Huawei app that is very easy to uninstall","Cons:Biggest con: was supposed to be without a touchscreen and Ryzen 2500U as per the possible selections, but it came with a touchscreen anyway. I didnt want the touchscreen since it drains battery life constantly whether it is in use or not. Oh well, guess I'll just have to live with it now.- USB C charging cable is kind of short, about 6 feet. I'd 100% recommend buying a longer one if you're going to be bringing this into coffee shops, at least 12 feet.Haven't found any other cons yet. It's a fantastic computer.","Other Thoughts:- It looks exactly like a macbook and I constantly keep checking whether I should be pressing the Cmd key instead of Ctrl for keyboard shortcuts, oops- Fan turns on kind of frequently and is louder than most ""new high end"" laptops. Doesn't bother me though.- Battery life, due to the touchscreen which I never wanted in the first place, is a little worse than I'd like. 6-7 hours instead of something like 7-9 hours. I'll live with it, but wouldve just liked there not to be a touchscreen in the first place.- Just a personal opinion, but the Huawei logo is kinda ugly and looks like NBC or something. I'd like there to be no logo on the back of the laptop. It's ""printed"" on, I think I'll try that sugarcube thing and just scratch it off while not damaging the metal :)",8,1
Huawei,53010BLA,4,Well built windows laptop money can buy,2018-09-11,"Pros:Feels solid, SSD + traditional HDD. USB ports and headphone jack.Dual graphics, intel + NVIDIA",Cons:Camera quality is mediocre. No USB C charging. Battery doesn’t last long ~3 hrs of mixed use. No backlight keyboard.,Other Thoughts:would be better if it would come with windows professional version,6,5
Huawei,53010BLA,5,One of the Best Laptops at it's Price,2018-09-09,"Pros:This computer (specifically the model you're looking at) blows me away in CPU and GPU performance at it's price. I am a student and yknow most kids love to play games and 3D a lot, and this computer does a great job. As a YouTuber, I can get up to 1080p60fps doing lightweight gaming like Minecraft and Roblox (low graphics settings, but I'm sure it can handle higher)! The i7 really kicks butt and the SSD boots up the computer super fast (<5 seconds). As for Adobe, it also works excellent handling Photoshop and Illustrator at a breeze.","Cons:The only real con I see is the battery life, it drains super fast (2 hours) if I do recording (1080p60s) and 3D gaming. If it's website and document usage, like for typing an essay, I can get up to 5-6 hours of usage time. At a full charge unplugged, it discharges (during sleep and off) around a percent per 5 hours but I don't usually leave it unplugged overnight.","Other Thoughts:This computer is probably in my opinion, one of the best cheap laptops out there. I wasn't even aware Huawei had Windows Laptops, as I've had Honor 8 and Mate 10 for a year (also great phones). If I could message Huawei, I'd say ""Excellent work! Keep up the convenience and speeds!""",5,3
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,1,DO NOT BUY,2017-05-29,Pros:it has a side number pad. that is THE ONLY GOOD THING I CAN SAY!,"Cons:the slowest computer I have used in 15 year. total piece of garbage. The touch pad sucks. they put the headphone jack IN THE BACK! who does that? I don't know why the Evan put a HDMI jack on it, it is to slow to stream ANYTHING! never buying an ACER ever ever ever again!",,0,0

Acer,ES1-512-C88M,5,,2015-04-30,"Pros:Sleek, works great, great for Business.Love that the HDMI/ USB/ Audio ports are located on the back of the laptop.","Cons:Windows 8.1 is lame, so I downloaded Classic Start Menu addon from online.","Other Thoughts:Make sure to delete the bloatware that comes preloaded, also make sure you are only running needed applications by pressing CTL+ALT+DELETE then closing out unneeded programs that dont need to be running.",0,0
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,1,No good if we can't use it,2015-04-20,Pros:There are no pros at all. We can't get it to operate at all because the computer came with no instruction manual.,Cons:Computer came with no instruction manual. This is inexcusable. We can't use the computer because there are no step by step instructions telling us how to use it. Windows 8.1 is extremely dissimilar to Windows 7 and is very hard to use.,Other Thoughts:Windows 8.1 is very bad news. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 should be strictly outlawed. Most people don't know how to use Windows 8 or 8.1 and it is too dissimilar to what most people are familiar with and not user friendly at all.,0,8
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,4,Decent laptop,2015-03-31,"Pros:-Decent hardware for the price, you can't find cheaper with better hardware unless you get something good on sale.","Cons:-Feels a bit flimsy. That, however, being expected with the price.-Lots of bloatware. Enjoy the clean up, which is especially slow with a 5400RPM HDD!-Windows 8.1 With Bing; Don't get me wrong, base Win8.1 is wonderful. I use it as my primary OS for my personal build. However, Windows 8.1 With Bing intends on integrating both your operating system, and bing experience, into one. Sounds good, no? No. It's terrible. Bing is terrible. The whole thing is an abomination. Aside from this being a nuisance, slow and painful as bing is; It is proprietary overreach. Take heed my warning and notice Windows 8.1 With Bing in the name of the laptops you happen to browse through, if you'd rather avoid it as well.",,0,0
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,4,Nice for the price,2015-03-18,"Pros:Nice laptop for the price, sturdy build, runs quiet, pretty thin and good picture quality. No complaints as of yet. I'll update with time.","Cons:The laptop shows oil marks from fingers like now tomorrow, I had just washed my hands and still I could see oil stains all over the thing.Bloatware was annoying to get rid of but only took ten minutes or so.","Other Thoughts:All in all you can't go wrong if you're looking for a cheap laptop to surf, or get some school work done.",0,0
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,5,Great Value,2015-03-12,"Pros:I normally use high-end gaming PCs that I build (often with components from Newegg) for gaming, graphic design and loads of other stuff. However, I occasionally have to go on the road and need a laptop. My past laptops seemed to die of old age rather than over-use, so I wanted something inexpensive, with a nice screen and keyboard and good battery time plus adequate I/O ports.I did not care about a CD/DVD drive as I very rarely use them these days...and, I can read whether one is included or not. Besides, I can always get a USB CD/DVD Combo drive for about $20.This Acer unit has so far met all of my needs and expectations. It's not lightning fast...but, it's totally capable of running the Office stuff, videos and desktop sharing connections I need when traveling.As a diehard Win 7 Pro user, I was expecting my head to explode with Win 8.1. It hasn't happened yet but it took me a few hours of swearing to learn all of the shortcuts and workarounds I needed. 8.1 isn't as horrible as I expected but I am still more comfortable with 7...perhaps that will change over time.I have always hated touchpads on laptops. They were things to disable so you could plug in a real mouse. The touchpad on this unit is much larger than any other I ever used. It has no separate left/right buttons...you simply push down the bottom corners, instead. Like with the OS issue, I am still fond of using a mouse. However, this touchpad seems to be easier and more usable...it's the first one I have not disabled.Overall, the really nice price, the decent quality and  reasonable performance make this a great value for me.","Cons:My only real disappointment is with fingerprints. Even the nicely textured case still shows up fingerprints...even when I haven't been eating fried chicken or ribs...honestly. I don't remember fingerprints as an issue with the old, gray/beige cases on 1980s vintage Compaqs.There is a fair amount of free stupidware installed. I call it stupid because I never see anything I would really want to use and I never get any free subscriptions for stuff I do use. There was not an excessive amount, but deleting it is a pain, nonetheless...especially one old antivirus software I won't name which seemed to take forever to delete.",Other Thoughts:None,2,0
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,4,Not bad for the money,2015-02-27,"Pros:Cheap, rugged plastic construction, survived being dropped on concrete no problem, no fans + no moving parts if you install an SSD. Hella nice once you replace the slow harddrive with an SSD.","Cons:Keyboard requires that you mash the keys before they register. Touchpad is annoying lacking distinct buttons, but maybe that's just how gesture/multi-touch touchpads are these days.",,1,0
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,2,You get what you pay for,2015-02-25,"Pros:Price. And it's durable. My kid spilled water on the keyboard about a week after we got it, and it sputtered and died. I took it apart and let it dry out for a week. I put it back together and it powered right up, good as new.","Cons:It's painfully slow, and choked with worthless bloatware. The trackpad is poor quality and pretty hard to work with. The whole thing has a cheap feel to it. But that's what I paid for so to be fair I can't really complain about it.","Other Thoughts:In retrospect I would not buy another Acer, and I would save an extra hundred bucks and get better quality components.",1,1
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,5,Good Laptop For the Money,2015-02-24,Pros:I very rarely write reviews but due to the number of negative reviews on this laptop I have to jump in.This is a very good laptop for the money.  For work and light gaming I've had absolutely no problems with it.  Battery life is excellent and it runs cool and quiet.For the people complaining about the adware I don't know why you are having trouble removing it.  Its not difficult.I did add an Intel SSD to it but that is the only upgrade.  SSD's are always worth the upgrade for anyone on the fence.

Acer,ES1-512-C88M,3,OK for the Price,2015-01-05,Pros:For the price it does what you want.,"Cons:You have to accept that it doesn't come with a CD/DVD drive or Bluetooth because they tell you that in the specs.  What I really am having trouble with is the weird/new touchpad style, which functions more like a Mac than a PC.  I don't know if it's designed to work specifically with Windows 8 or make it more like a tablet, but it is really difficult to master.  My son seems to be picking it up with use, but it still frustrates me at times.",,2,0
Acer,ES1-512-C88M,2,Drowning in Adware,2014-12-28,Pros:It's inexpensive,"Cons:Absolutely flooded with adware which has so far made it nearly impossible to use.

Doing so will wipe out all the included bloatware, which is so severe it bogs down the system to an almost frozen state. I additionally recommend upgrading the HDD and the RAM as soon as possible. If you can only upgrade one, upgrade the HDD. 500 GB 7200 rpm drives are easy to find and inexpensive, and the difference is like night and day. A SSD would be even better. I am much happier with my G50 after upgrading. When upgrading the RAM, make sure you purchase  low voltage compatible sticks, or it will not run correctly.On to the keyboard: Lenovo Accutype keyboards of a certain generation have a tendency towards malfuntion; if a key is not pressed directly in the center, or is not pressed hard enough (even though a click can be heard and felt when pressed) the key will not register. Additionally, some keys will duplicate occasionally. This is a known issue with some keyboards, but Lenovo basically refuses to do anything about it. Others on the internet have sent their laptop in to have the keyboard replaced only to receive it with an equally faulty keyboard installed. This issue has forced me to slow my typing and absolutely pound the keys, which can result in cramps, possibly reduced keyboard life, and can be annoying to anyone around. This may or may not still be an issue on newly manufactured units; I purchased mine around a year ago. On the positive side, they keyboard is large enough to be comfortable to type on, has a very nice full number pad, arrow keys, and the caps lock and num lock keys have indicator lights directly on them. Volume control hotkeys at the top are handy, and though I don't find myself using them much its nice to have the other hotkeys there as well.",1,0

Really good for that tier of laptop. Quad core 2ghz, good GPU because it's a A8.Surprisingly quiet and cool since it's an AMD. They tend to be on the noisy and hot side but it's really nice in my opinion. The processor seem to be placed right on the right of the trackpad, cuz that's where I feel a bit of heat coming out from. The CPU fan is really quiet (surprisingly again). I'm not really greedy when it comes to keybards and trackpads. As long as it works and does what I'm telling it to do it's fine. Yes the shift key on the right side is small, but it's only a matter of time before I don't notice it anymore.Glossy display, it might not be a pro but colors seem to be more vivid, I like the fact that they went with click buttons for right and left trackpad because it is easier to use I guess and it's less of a hassle.  The dvd drive bay is not necessary, but it's a plus and the slim design is really nice. I kinda wish there were usb ports on the back of the laptop but other than that it's ok.","Cons:Freeware/bloatware.... Hory shneizer it seemed like the computer came infested with cancer, std, aids and all kinds of diseases. It's incredible the amount of softwares I had to uninstall. It was really make it slow but once you start removing them the computer seem more fluid. I can't really blame them anyways. It's thanks to that that the laptop is cheaper than what it should be. I don't really get the idea of dividing the hard drive into 2 partitions (comes pre-configured in 2 partitions, 1 partition for OS I guess and the other your stuff) but I might just merge it cuz I don't need 2 partitions.I know it's 399, but I kinda wished there was a backlit keyboard.

It seems like they keyboard buffer itself si messed up because i often find that it has put letters on the screen that are actually out of order to how I typed them, to the point where it would have been ipossible to type them that way. Even though I get haptic feedback fro the keypress, I oftn find that the character is missig. Other times, a character may unintentionnally repeat (I swear I didn't do that on purpose just nw).I do type fast. My job requires it. MMy productivity on this thing is seriouslyil diinished because of all the corrections i have to make.WHERE DID THAT SECOND i IN SERIOUSLY COME FROM? I did not type that! This keyboard is demented. It's a serious frustration.Also, even for a bargain-basement budget low-resolution screen, the color is horrible. Everything's awash in too much bulue. I've tried t color correct it somewhat, but Windows 8.1's native gamma is only so good.",,1,0

Lenovo,G50-45 (80E3005NUS),1,Terrible product quality,2015-02-16,Pros:Worked great and fast up until it stopped working for no reason.,"Cons:After only 5 months, the laptop turned into a $500 brick suddenly.  Turned it off, and then wouldn't boot back into the desktop the next day.  Blue screen of death and then refused to turn on at all.  Lenovo, despite their ""award winning"" warranty, wouldn't cover the repair and then tried to upsell me into a subscription warranty service when they refused to fix it.  They even charge for the phone call, which was not made clear until after I called them.  Also, be aware that they charge $70 for any recovery discs or services, which they require you go through convoluted phone menus to get to (no online options exist).  They then try to upsell you even more ($20/month technical services).  I'm not impressed with Lenovo after this.  They don't include software discs with the laptop and their hardware warranty is apparently really limited.  Newegg customer service passed me off onto them, saying they couldn't do anything (after a sloppy and grammar error ridden quick message - they even managed to spell my name wrong).  I'm just lucky that I backed up my most important files, since it's just a dead piece of hardware now, and even if I did manage to scavenge and put it back together (or pay ridiculous amounts to get it repaired) it's all gone.I've purchased 3 laptops with Newegg over the years, and this will be the last one for sure.","Other Thoughts:I am immensely disappointed in both Newegg and Lenovo.  I was a huge fan of both before this experience, and I will warn people off both from now on.",7,3
Lenovo,G50-45 (80E3005NUS),1,Please invest in something else!!!,2015-02-12,Pros:No Pros,Cons:It is the worst laptop I have ever used. First of all I hate windows 8 and then on top of it's battery life is nothing may 2 hours maximum and the touch pad ughhhhh.. there is no precision. The mouse will suddenly go at the top of your browser as soon as you will try to click anywhere on the page. I wish I had never invested $500 in this piece of ____. Battery will be gone without enough warning and all your unsaved data will be gone. You can't share anything when on Skype without signing in through their stupid system.  Plain and simple - it is very annoying.,"Other Thoughts:Trust me don't go with only the affordability, this isn't good at all.",2,4

Lenovo,G50-45 (80E3005NUS),1,KEEP THE BOX!,2014-10-14,Pros:None,"Cons:The computer started displaying issues with the hard drive less than 3 weeks after I got it. Newegg would not return it because I didn't have the original box (although I did have all of the paperwork). It was still under warranty so Lenovo fixed it, but I had to ship it to Texas and it was gone for just over 2 weeks. I was shocked that a brand new computer would need repairs in less than 3 weeks! Ironically, I live in the town next to a Newegg warehouse, so I wish they could have helped me. Newegg said Lenovo needed the box in order for them (Newegg) to eventually return it to Lenovo. However, Lenovo insists this is Newegg's policy and they should have helped me better. I'm not pleased with either Lenovo or Newegg and won't be purchasing fronm either again. A computer that either had issues so soon or potentially came damaged is not ok, and I should have received better customer support.",,7,5
Lenovo,G50-45 (80E3005NUS),1,not worth the headaches,2014-10-07,Pros:a lot of nice features,"Cons:Did not live up to expectations - I bought this for my son for school and had nothing but problems with it from day 1...Called Lenovo Tech support and they were at a loss for why it wasn't loading and freezing constantly. They advised me to format and reload  - it ran a little better but never like it should have. Lenovo agreed to provide a full refund after i let there tech guy access it remotely and trouble shoot. He was baffled as to why it wasn't performing. I have since returned it and bought a Dell - what a difference!! I think it may have been the A8 processor that was the problem, the Dell has an I5 processor and it blows the doors off the Lenovo. I would not recommend this computer unless you have a lot of time to waste on the phone with Tech support!",,5,4
Lenovo,G50-45 (80E3005NUS),3,Good For The Price,2014-10-04,"Pros:Quick boot, very quiet, decent speed, good graphics and an average battery life (3 hours on battery save, 2 hours on balanced).I use this for entertainment and some work, mostly on the web, and it handles my needs pretty well. Could certainly be better.I don't use this to game so have no idea how it handles them.","Cons:I'm not impressed with the A-8. I would say I'm disappointed. It seems to struggle with multi-tasking, especially with relatively to high resource programs. It's slower than the i3, that's for sure. And no option int he BIOS to overclock. In fact, the BIOS is pretty bare.Speaker placement is dumb - on the bottom of the laptop. Appears to be plenty of room on the sides of the keyboard but maybe it's not enough. Anyway, the sound is compromised because it's usually muted by whatever you have the laptop on.","Other Thoughts:You get what you pay for. Still, at this price, it's your best bet.",6,2

Lenovo,G50-45 (80E3005NUS),4,"After six years, great choice for an upgrade!",2014-07-17,"Pros:Since I haven't upgraded laptops for 6 years (I chose to rebuild two years back, which took more money than I paid for this laptop, so bad decision there), this sleek, slim, and lightweight laptop is a surprisingly wonderful upgrade for the price.  For a similar laptop from either Dell or HP, I would have paid twice the price AT LEAST.  The NVIDIA integrated graphics card is more than enough to handle the older games I play on my laptop since I play the larger ones on my tower.The transition between Windows 8's panel mode and traditional mode is seamless and quick, allowing you to quickly get to what you want while still allowing you to use your computer in a familiar way.The addition of a number pad on the keyboard is a little confusing, as the spacing I'm used to for the arrow keys and a much smaller enter button is different, but it's great since the music scoring software I use greatly depends on number pad use for speed, and having a USB number pad was both bulky and frustrating.  It'll just take getting used to!The laptop is incredibly quiet and runs very cool, a great change from my old Inspiron's fan whirring to life every 10 minutes.The laptop includes both VGA AND HDMI ports.  Since I teach and most Smartboard/Promethean products still use VGA cables, this means I won't have to buy an adapter.The webcam, light, and microphone are great, according to my Skype buddies.The computer charges VERY fast.  I'll still have to play around with the energy use settings to find the best setting for battery life, but it seems to last around 3-4 hours with streaming a video.","Cons:The speakers, although good, are on the bottom side of the laptop.  This is disappointing, especially if you're consistently putting your laptop in your lap, which muffles the sound dramatically.  When you have it on a flat surface, the sound and projection is great, however.  For the placement, the laptop loses an egg from me--as a musician and an audiophile, good speakers are important.  They are good speakers, but the placement ruins it.  There are so many other places, like alongside or above the keyboard.  Since I haven't opened the laptop up (and probably won't), I don't know if there is internal space for the speakers elsewhere, though, so where they are might have been the only solution.There is no Windows code sticker, documentation, or installation disc included with the laptop.","Other Thoughts:Fresh out of the box, the laptop was almost completely ready to use for me with the exception of a few programs needing to be installed.  Set up was fast and easy and, contrary to popular belief, it's not that hard to get used to Windows 8 since it allows traditional Windows 7 mode and the switch between modes is incredibly quick.  This review may be updated depending on if things change over the first few weeks of use.",7,7
Lenovo,V330 (81AX00GGUS),4,Lovely Little Laptop!,2018-12-19,"Pros:- 15"" display is wonderful to look at.- Small keyboard and chiclet keys make it easy for my small hands to type. (Note: If you have larger hands, this might be a little more difficult).- Runs the entire Adobe CC Suite flawlessly. Not all at once, though, that would be crazy. Please never subject your computer to that.- A FULL KEYBOARD! A num pad and everything! As someone who works with Excel and does a lot of number entry, having this feature on my laptop is a MUST.- The trackpad is smooth and minimal. Designed well; feels better. I love this trackpad. It took the left and right clicks a little bit to warm up, but after a little use, this trackpad is just right. The gestures are easy to learn and intuitive, and the sound and feeling of the clicks are so satisfying.- Fingerprint scanner to sign in is a great feature. This is my first time having a computer with a fingerprint scanner, but I am in love! It scans quickly and logs you in without having to use a password, saving time and your memory!- The thin build makes it perfect for transport! I work from home as well as at an office, and I carry my computer with me wherever I go so I can get work done anywhere. This laptop slides easily into my backpack and my laptop bag.- Backlit keyboard.- The webcam has a little plastic slidey thingy over it so I don't have to put a sticky note over it anymore.","Cons:Okay, now the hard part. There are a few things I find...lacking with this laptop. Now don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this computer. It's a fine machine. However...these few changes would definitely make the experience more comfortable.- Battery life. It's awful. If you need a computer that lasts you for quite some time, this isn't the one. The most I've seen this battery keep a charge was about 5 hours. Does not last me a full workday.- The shiny design of the shell attracts lots of oils. I have to continue wiping the lid of the laptop to keep it looking nice.- The speakers aren't great. I use nice headphones, and I would recommend you do as well if you want decent sound out of the computer.EDIT 12/19/18A few additional drawbacks I have with this product.- No good viewing angles for the screen. It's beginning to get on my nerves.- I wish the backspace was bigger, but that's subjective.- CPU maxes out fast, especially when trying to run multiple programs at once. Don't expect to do any real heavy lifting with this computer. Keep it simple.Otherwise, I am still very much enjoying this product!","Other Thoughts:If given the choice, I would purchase this laptop again, but since I have this one that works perfectly, I'm probably not going to. Hypothetically, I would!In conclusion, this computer works perfectly for what I need. If you want a nice little work laptop that can also handle a bit more heavy lifting, I would recommend the Lenovo V330 laptop!",0,0
Lenovo,V330 (81AX00GGUS),4,It Works,2018-12-17,"Pros:I'm using this as a basic work computer- internet, email, youtube, ms office, music. I don't play games on this. Nothing too taxing. I'm happy it came with the internal DVD RW, because I didn't want to have to buy another thing to damage, lose or lug around. The full sized keyboard with numeric keyboard is great for someone like me who uses it for data entry.-Me likey SSD. So quiet. So fast.-Pleasantly surprised it has a back-lit keyboard. I didn't see that on that on the description before I bought it.-Speakers are really very decent.-I like that it has a built in camera privacy cover thingy. I used tape on my old laptop.","Cons:So far, so good, but it's really only been a few weeks.-At this price point, what do you expect? I have to move the screen a little when I shift my position a little.-I wish I didn't have to press the function key to activate the home/pgup/pgdn/end keys.-The finish on the trackpad and chassis lends itself to finger smudges pretty easily.-My speakers were getting a lot of crackles. I updated the driver and I think that fixed it. Or maybe it was resetting. Either way, I haven't had a problem since.","Other Thoughts:Yeah, go buy this if you're not doing anything very hairy.

If you have every power saving measure in place and you're just surfing the internet with nothing else running, you could get about 5 to 6 hours running time. I however I watch a lot of video and this drains the battery much quicker. Lucky to get 3 and a half hours that way.-The sound quality is muffled, passable I guess but not great-The cooling fans are loud and very annoying to me personally-The material this laptop is made out of is very, very prone to smudges that are very visible. I have to wipe it down after I use it so I don't have to look at smudges-The display could probably be more crisp but passable I guess","Other Thoughts:After a week of use, I wouldn't recommend this to someone unless they are using it mostly as an at home, business laptop. It's not very good for media/entertainment or travel where you'd need good battery life without having to worry about charging after a few hours use. I'm going to return it.",0,0

Very impressive considering it has very little cooling. It's also quiet.- Backlit keyboard- The i5-7200U is a decent CPU for school and business uses.- Build quality is decent, it's better built than my old MSI laptop. Screen is a little flimsy however.- You can expand to a second ultrabay battery, but good luck finding one.- Has all of the ports you need and a DVD drive.- Lots of dedicated media keys- Sliding door for webcam- I love the minimalist design on this laptop.- Good specs for the price, especially with an included M2 SSD.- Fast and small charger- Fingerprint reader works fine for me, although it's small and hard to see.","Cons:- Touchpad is kind of bad. It's very high in friction, sometimes it easily clicks, and it doesn't have the greatest accuracy.- Many competitors have better battery life, this will do 4-6 hours. Many of others will reach 8-10.- I will get used to it but I wish the backspace button was bigger.- Battery and hard drive lights are on the left side of the laptop. Why?- The screen is blatant mediocre. The colors and contrast are meh, and the viewing angles are bad. But I don't see many laptops with good screens anyway.- Macafee, windows, and lenovo bloatware, easy to uninstall though.- Screen takes a lot of force to open, either open it in the middle, or use 2 hands. You might warp the screen overtime if opened by other ways.","Other Thoughts:I've only had this laptop for two days so I'll update it as I continue using it!I bought this laptop for school purposes. I wanted something fairly cheap but very fast and can run everything.

Lenovo,V330 (81AX00GGUS),5,Outstanding Price To Performance,2018-09-05,"Pros:- Pro version of Windows- 256GB Samsung NVMe SSD, and mounting hardware for a 2.5"" HDD or SSD- Looks and feels great- Excellent keyboard and decent trackpad, backlit keyboards are almost non existent at this price point- Webcam privacy slide- Pretty lightweight- Screen is better than any you'll find at this price point- Plenty of ports in all varieties, including a USB-C port with Power Delivery AND Displayport, unheard of in even higher priced laptops- Decent battery life","Cons:- Comes with a DVD drive, which for some people might want it, but our company doesn't use optical media anymore and so it takes up space and adds weight.- Even though there is hardware for adding a 2.5"" drive, the VGA port makes taking the base of and putting it back on again very difficult. Cracked one of the units trying to put the base back on.","Other Thoughts:The value you of this laptop is phenomenal! I am stunned that this laptop has a sub $550 price tag.Even though the SSD is small, you can add a 500GB 2.5"" SSD for $100 bucks, which still makes this laptop a steal.I have ordered a few of these for the company I work for and have added either a 500GB WD Blue SSD, or 512GB ADATA Ultimate SSD. This laptop is extremely quick and snappy. Boot time is generally 7-12 seconds.The users that got these laptop won't stop talking about how quick they are.Our company has a very tight budget, so when tend to order consumer grade laptops instead of business-grade.

Lenovo,V330 (81AX00GGUS),5,Great laptop!,2018-08-14,"Pros:Fast (mine boots in 4 seconds, with fingerprint reader I am in Windows in about 6 seconds), quiet and everything functions better than ANY laptop brand than I have ever owned. (I've owned several.) The fingerprint reader ACTUALLY works very fast even when my finger isn't exactly in position! Doesn't work using the wrong finger or someone else trying it. The optical drive can be removed and the camera has a block that physically slides over the lens. I really checked this out by researching it on the web and found out that Lenovo took over the top spot in laptops from Apple in 2017! Easily connected to my wireless dual band (on 5GHz) router and surfs fast . Extremely light and looks great. This laptop has all of the lights for CAPS lock, NUM lock, power, HDD and battery. The Lenevo apps make easy to register and install driver updates. They also have the Lenovo task bar which shows battery percentage. The battery lasts fairly long; I was using it for about two hours setting it up and it still had about a 56% charge. Touchpad doesn't have 'mouse' buttons, but the pad does click where the buttons would be. Keeps the touchpad smooth and maintains the 'spill-resistant' keyboard. The keyboard is very nice and it has lights - low, high off! The Dolby audio and stereo speakers make this PC sound good and the Intel HD Graphics 620 with 1920 x 1080 resolution makes the graphics pop. Minimal bloatware.",Cons:Fingerprint reader area should have a narrow white border or something around it to see it better.,"Other Thoughts:I would definitely purchase this again and I would highly recommend it to someone looking for a general use laptop. It would make a very nice computer for a college student as well. Note - I use a wireless mouse, but I did use the touchpad while setting it up. It was very responsive and didn't really need any adjusting. I just prefer a mouse.",6,0
Lenovo,V330 (81AX00GGUS),5,"Does what it does, biggest annoyance is Windows 10 and included bloatware.",2018-08-10,"Pros:-Decent specs for students and office purposes. NOT a quad core processor, though-Nice screen, bright, good resolution, good colors-Good keyboard feel and useful function keys, play/pause, volume, brightness control-Fingerprint scanner is useful-Thoughtful to include a cover for the webcam-Plenty powerful for office/schoolwork tasks-Powerful enough to do some very light gaming-Includes an optical drive which I still find very important and not common to find anymore-Good number and variety of ports-The body doesn't get sticky fingerprints all over it","Cons:-The speakers are a little hollow and tinny sounding but they're serviceable-The friction of the trackpad is too high which makes accurate trackpad use difficult, especially when using drag and drop. Probably get a mouse to use with it if you plan on using this as your main computer-I know this is standard for pretty much all windows laptops, but it bothers me that the trackpad is centered on the spacebar and not on the frame of the laptop as a whole-Very light and maybe a little cheap feeling. That's just how things are built nowadays unfortunately. I wouldn't trust this to survive a fall and I'm not willing to test it. I'd probably also avoid throwing it into a backpack with heavy books, this could probably easily bend and warp. Feels like I could snap it in half with my bare hands.-Took a good bit of time to clean this thing of bloatware. On such a small SSD every bit counts. 256GB is more than enough for my purposes but if you're intention is to use this as a primary computer you should either install an HDD or bigger SSD-Windows 10 is an annoying operating system to say the least. It takes a good while to clean it up from ads, suggested apps, etc, etc. Don't forget to also disable Cortana by performing a simply registry change.","Other Thoughts:Got this for a steal of a deal $450, so it's great for that price for the specs. I'm accustomed to building gaming PCs but I've always had Apple laptops until now. This doesn't have the fit and finish of Apple products but the niceties like better speakers, nicer trackpad, better screen, etc. can easily be done without for half the price tag. Recent changes to Apple products have also deterred me such as lack of ports, optical drives and some annoying changes to their latest versions of OSX. So far this has proven to be perfectly capable as a replacement for my old Macbook. Just be sure to properly clean it up before doing anything else or it will become annoying to deal with. I know I made the con section a bit long but I wanted to give an accurate depiction of what to expect, and the pros far outweigh the cons. Just treat it with proper care and everything should be fine. I'd definitely recommend this computer for students, business use, or anybody who needs a general non-gaming laptop.",4,0
Lenovo,V330 (81AX00GGUS),4,Good Laptop - great price/performance,2018-07-16,"Pros:Lightweight, quiet, fast performance, keyboard back-light, good specs for the price, display is great for viewing - I bought this for around $550 ($200 off sale).",Cons:The lcd housing seems a bit flimsy/flexible compared to some other systems I have owned.  I would recommend opening it from the center to avoid damage/warping over time.  Windows 10 comes with a lot of promo software so I had to remove a lot of Windows apps that I didn't want or need.,Other Thoughts:We used our existing e-mail to set up a Microsoft account.  The laptop needed to be updated to the latest version of Windows 10 (due to manufacturing timing).  This will be used as a student laptop for College and seems to perform this task exceptionally well.  I added Office 2016 Pro Plus and Google Chrome for the primary system workflow.

HP,840 G1 (E3W30UT#ABA),5,Amazing Laptop,2015-03-11,"Pros:This thing has an incredible battery life.Able to do lots of gaming, though this is not a ""gaming laptop"".  Probably won't handle the new high-end games, but I have played S.T.A.L.K.E.R Clear Sky, on Medium res settings... no problem.  I have also played F.E.A.R. 2, on higher res no problem.  Look into the video card specs yourself to determine if it's good for you.  I played for about 2 hours and still had 20% remaining.  I bumped my power settings to power saver mode to achieve this (not hard... just select from your power icon by the clock or control panel in windows settings).It has a really nice fingerprint scan security.  You can bypass it and use the password at any time instead, but it's a nice quick entry option for security instead of the password.The back-lit keyboard.Upgrading memory is really easy (I did -- went from 4gb to 8gb).Comes with CD Media to fully restore to factory, even though it doesn't have a CD ROM (you will need an external CD ROM to do this, which I have).Has integrated system restore partition, so you can do a system restore without the disks (assuming no hard drive failure, of course).  On that note, using the disks does a truly factory restore, while using the integrated restore does not actually reinstall all the security features.  I know, because Windows became corrupt and I already had to do this.  I reinstalled from the system first, and noticed I was missing a few extras (extras I liked).  So I reinstalled from the discs, and the finger scan security was and everything was setup truly factory.  The integrated restore really just re-installs Windows, and all necessary drivers.  So still a complete and function reinstall of the OS.Very thin, and lightweight.","Cons:The back-lit keyboard is really great for working in the dark. Perhaps I should list this in the cons, and may I will, but the only thing I don't like is it only lights up when you press a key... for about 3 seconds (and continues to stay lit as you continue to press keys). I wish there was a setting to leave the back lighting on. If there is, I have not found that setting.","Other Thoughts:I build computers.  I have since very young, and have always been a desktop person.  Over the years of a growing family, laptops have become more practical for us and I am very technical in general.  This laptop is very good for the money (but I only paid $500 on a black Friday deal from Newegg).I like this one so much, I purchased another one when for my in-laws when they were looking to upgrade from their desktop.Make sure you are aware this DOES NOT HAVE A CD ROM.

HP,840 G1 (E3W30UT#ABA),3,"Great, basic laptop",2015-01-25,"Pros:Fast, light , portable.  I love how thin this Ultrabook is. It is super-light weight and will do great for my traveling.I opted for the 128 GB SSD solution and can tell you that after installing a few of my applications, stored music... etc, it easily eats up close to half+ of the capacity.  Not a huge problem now, but I may need to upgrade the SSD within the year.The empty RAM slot makes it easy to add more RAM.Core i5 gives my plenty computing power for my uses. Light web browsing, MS office tools, music software.Battery life is amazing for such a small form-factor.Back-lit keyboard is also nice and makes typing in dark/shaded areas easier. The feel and sensitivity of the keys is perfect. Not ultra sensitive, but at the same time not super stiff.","Cons:No HDMI port. This is not a deal breaker as I do not plan on connecting this externally much, but now a days this should be a pretty standard thing.Also, no disk drive. Also was not a huge concernIn my opinion the Black Matte Plastic Top is an awesome design. However, this is definitely prone to fingerprints/smudges. So if this is a bother to anyone else, you may want to seek another laptop.After upgrading the RAM the lowest scoring factor to this Ultrabook is the graphics. Obviously.

HP,840 G1 (E3W30UT#ABA),5,Outstanding laptop,2015-01-14,"Pros:This has an extremely powerful I5 (roughly  80% the power of my desktop I7-920). The 4 gigs of RAM are plenty for most purposes, and EASILY upgradable. I mean, 30 seconds to swap out your RAM without tools. There's just a back panel that is securely fastened, but buttons off and it pops open effortlessly, with your SSD/HDD, RAM, and other components easily accessible and labeled, including the battery which is safely contained inside the housing.The SSD is a beast, hitting the highest PASSMARK performance scores (literally better than any comparison drives listed), and outperforming most SSD's easily. HDD's can't even compete, and this thing boots up in about 10-15 seconds. The fingerprint reader is extremely effective and usually works on the first go without being careful, which is unusual on laptop fingerprint readers.The security features on this thing are too numerous to mention. This thing SIPS power. I mean, I went from using an i7-720m on my last laptop, which used 130-140 watt adapter, to this thing, which uses 11 watts at full load, and comes with an adapter fit for a large tablet.The case is built like a brick, while still being light. It's one giant cold piece of metal, which is rock solid, yet stunningly light. No bizarre frills or bloatware, it's a business oriented system.I really liked this laptop when I saw it, and I have to say, it was actually better than expected.","Cons:Not a one. Just be sure to perform all updates right away, and there will be a lot, as this system has not only Windows updates, but HP updates which are generous and forthcoming (and that's a good thing).","Other Thoughts:This system says it's a $1199 system on the specs, and although they generally have it much cheaper, it really is an $1199 system. It feels like you are holding a premium product, it has powerful processing and a rapid SSD, and comes in a solid body. It has a 3 year warranty (keep your receipt, that's the official warranty instrument, otherwise they use date of production) which is a fabulous warranty for such a cheap laptop. Also, you get Windows 7 and 8 discs, in full. You don't even have to make the backups (though you have no disc drive, so you need a USB one to use them).Ultimately, I am completely satisfied at this laptop. I owned a Dell, HP, Compaq, and Acer laptop during the last 9 years. This is the first one that hits the sweet spot of powerful processing and rapid performance, coupled with low energy usage (battery longevity) and almost no heat (idles at 95 F, working at about 130 F). I've struggled for years to find that (and spent much more money), and this really does seem to be the perfect package.You absolutely can't go wrong with this system. Also, the complaints about the track pad and rubber pointer you see on some of the reviews are nonsense. It all works perfectly, though it may be possible to get better, if you're willing to drop some serious dough on a much higher system.",1,0

The keys are very easy to type on.  In the last three years I have used a MacBook Air, an HP Elitebook 8470, a Dell XPS 13, and an Acer c740 Chromebook, and this computer --HP EliteBook 840. This computer has the best keyboard by far and I spend all day typing on it; I type more than 10,000 words per day at the minimum.The only problem I have with this laptop is the mousepad. Often times it tapping it does not register. If  I click on a link, nothing happens so I have to do it again.

HP,840 G1 (E3W30UT#ABA),5,Definitely Recommend,2014-12-23,"Pros:I've been using the 840 for a year now and absolutely love it.  Our business is switching over exclusively to these to replace our aging fleets of xx40, xx60 and xx70 series of Elitebooks.Users of the older models complained of the weight and bulk and love the new lightweight and slim desgin of the 840.  Those that used the 12"" model appreciate having a 14"" screen that weighs much less than their 12"" did.The backlit keyboard is a huge improvement over the LED light that used to be on the screen by the camera of previous models which didn't work most of the time.The speed and performance boost from the SSD is also a big improvement.  A lot of our sales force is on the road and they can be a bit rough on PCs so not having a mechanical drive means much less support is needed because drives aren't crashing like they used to from being bumped, dropped, etc.We order all our 840s with 8GB RAM standard which is more than sufficient, but they can run up to 16GB which again for those with resource intense applications is a great option.There is also a USB port on the left side (lightning bolt) that you can use to charge your phone even when the PC is off which I find as a great benefit when needing to charge while on the go (such as walking through the airport or taking a bus/taxi someplace).","Cons:The only con for me is the 180GB SSD that comes standard.  For most of our users it is more than sufficient, but some of the IT folks and power users could use a 250GB or 500GB SSD (I happen to run multiple VMs on mine for testing) so space is tight but it was easily fixed by installing a larger size SSD.Some people might find the lack of a CD/DVD as a con, but let's be serious.  If you're still using CD/DVD media, you need to get with the times.  USB sticks are cheap and hold a lot more data than a CD/DVD can and are much more portable.  That combined with cloud and network based storage there is no reason to need a CD/DVD drive anymore.  All media can be downloaded and installed directly.  As a member of the IT team responsible for all client applications, I can't recall a time when we had any physical media to install software over the last 2-3 years unless it's a really old program that should be retired or upgraded to a current and supportable version anyway.","Other Thoughts:Had been a fan of the Lenovo line of notebooks for a long time but the newest Elitebooks have finally tipped me in favor of the HP notebooks.  My brother got a new Lenovo notebook from his company recently and my HP 840 blows it away across the board: weight, size, features, performance...you name it.",7,0
HP,840 G1 (E3W30UT#ABA),2,HP Elitebook 840G1 Ultrabook- A Step Backwards,2014-11-14,Pros:- Slim Design- Lighter than previous Elitebook models- Backlighted Keyboard does make it easy to use in dark room.- Front of Keyboard is sturdy such that you can rest your wrists on it without sending the mouse cursor moving everywhere. This is a BIG improvement.,Cons:- i5 CPU is slower and less powerful than in the HP 8460p- SDXC Slot is exposed which allows Card to be Damaged!- No CD/DVD drive- Screen is less bright than Elitebook 8460p- USB 3.0 Ports seem slower than on the 8460p- No 54mm card slot- Black Matte Plastic Top gets fingerprints and oil marks and it is difficult to clean.,"Other Thoughts:I currently own HP Elitebook 8440p, 8460p, and Probook 4525s for my small business/home use.  I now have a HP Elitebook 840G1 with 256GB SSD and 16GB Ram running Windows 7 64-Bit Pro OS  which I have been using for several months.  Up to now, I have been very happy with the HP Elitebook series laptops because they had excellent features like e-sata ports, firewire ports, Display ports, rugged mil spec construction, upgradeable, excellent support from HP, and very good performance for the price.  The previous HP Elitebooks were workhorses but they were a little heavy.I like the slimmer design of the 840G1 and the lighter weight.  The battery life is a little better than for previous models which makes it unnecessary to use an extended life battery unless you regularly take very long international flights (they now have power ports at your seat so even that isn't a reason to get a bigger battery).   I also really like the new backlighted keyboard which lets me type in a dark room.  The older little LED light on the 8460p top of screen was totally non-functional.  I also like that the keyboard top is now sturdy like the older 8440 models such that I can rest my wrists on the front of the keyboard to type without disturbing the cursor.   Those are the only things I like about the 840G1.In general, the 840G1 is a step down from the 8460p in terms of processor performance and capability.  CPU intensive applications like video transcoding are much slower on the 840G1.   The lack of a CD/DVD read/writer is also a problem for me.  I have to load the files from another PC to save them to my SSD and that is much smaller than before.With previous models I put a 128GB SDXC card in the laptop to extend the memory capacity.  The 840G1 has the slot but it does not protect the card which sticks out about 4mm.  I managed to crush a card and lost all the files from that card with this PC!!!!   This is a BIG Problem for me.  You have to remove the SCXC card whenever you are not using it and that is a Problem.  They also eliminate the 54mm card slot so you cannotThe screen brightness isn't any improvement over the 8460p either.  I would say that graphics performance is the same or slightly less than with the 8460p.  It certainly isn't up to the 8460w.Bottom line - The 840G1 is lighter, slimmer, and has a longer battery life than the older Elitebooks.   To get that, you have to give up features like a faster processor, sturdiness, CD/DVD drive, e-sata port, and a good SDXC card slot and a 54mm card slot.I want HP to make a unit like the 8460 but with the sturdiness and keyboard of the 8440.   I will take the weight to get the features.   I would give up the 840G1 in a second but I have it on lease for the next two years.",12,16
ASUS,F554LA-WS52,1,No user serviceable parts - not even to change the battery - cheaply built,2017-02-03,Pros:Fast with a descent screen.,"Cons:This computer started to fall apart almost as soon as we purchased it. The screws started falling out from the bottom, we could hear plastic parts inside that had been broken off after the screws had fallen out. Today the computer wouldn't start up. Since the battery is installed INSIDE the computer, we had to take the computer apart just to remove it so the motherboard could completely be powered down. In the process of taking the computer apart, one of the ribbon cable headers that connects the keyboard to the motherboard broke. Now the keyboard won't work at all. We will in all probability have to just throw the computer away because unless I order a new motherboard, it will never work as designed again.Terrible build quality and design.",Other Thoughts:I will not buy another Asus computer.

ASUS,F554LA-WS52,1,Literally Falling Apart,2016-07-27,"Pros:When the laptop boots up, it's ""fine."" There was a lot of bloatware on it, but that was easy to fix. It came with Windows 8 -- aka, the bane of anyone's existence. Thankfully the Windows 10 upgrade fixed a lot of the issues.","Cons:I'm not hard on my laptops. While I do carry them to/from work 5 days a week, I use a padded case, padded backpack, and I'm careful during transportation. This is my second ASUS. The first one lasted me 5 years... I'll be lucky to get a full year out of this one.Multiple screws have fallen out of the case. Replacing them isn't an option, as the screw holes are basically stripped. The face of the CD drive comes off all the time -- another missing screw perhaps?The worst issue is that despite gentle use, this computer now picks and chooses when it wants to turn on. About 75% of the time  time when I open the laptop (after being in sleep mode), it refuses to turn on at all. The power button is unresponsive, and none of the computer lights are on, despite the computer being plugged in and charged. This has caused multiple problems at work -- late for video conferences, printing out materials, etc.Thankfully I've discovered that if I plug/unplug between 20-50 times... it will suddenly turn on again.

ASUS,F554LA-WS52,2,$250 laptop with a $500 pricetag,2016-02-29,Pros:8gb ram,"Cons:Worst part about this is hands down the track pad. I'd suffer in quiet dissatisfaction through the flimsy discount construction (you've probably gotten sturdier fast food containers) and the fact that it seems to have problems extending to other monitors at 1080p, if it wasn't for how absolutely frustrating the track pad is. The cursor likes to shift dramatically under the slightest pressure and the left/right buttons are part of the trackable area. So if you position the cursor over something, when you lower your finger onto the right-click area, it'll register it as movement before it registers it as a click-- so the cursor moves and you right-click somewhere else. Drag and drop: same problem. Scrolling? Same problem. (Two finger swipe-to-scroll works with IE, not in chrome. I guess that's a software issue and not a hardware issue, but due to the fact that I can't work around it by using trackpad ""normally"", I'm counting against the laptop itself.). The Fn key to disable the trackpad doesn't even work, so even when I plug a mouse in, the slightest motion of the trackpad while typing sends the screen into a frenzy of undesired activity.","Other Thoughts:Contrary to the experience of another user, I upgraded to Win10 the first day I got it with no heartache other than possibly losing any pre-installed track-pad disabling software. Whatever other bloat there may have been was wiped clean too, though.Final thoughts: I assumed at a $500 pricetag, I'd be getting a decent degree, and I just haven't seen that. The 8GB was nice, but in hindsight, I should have just bought a $200 machine and upgraded the ram.",0,0

Black texture seems to pick up scratches and smudges really easily, particularly on the back of the screen.  Disappointing lack of an SSD","Other Thoughts:I bought this laptop in August 2015 as a daily carry and light use PC for classes. When I first started it up I noticed two things, it made a surprising amount of noise for a new laptop, and it was riddled with bloatware. I fixed those issues as best I could and proceeded to carry it too and from classes for about 6 months now. Over that period of time it developed a number of issues. I began to notice screws falling out of the bottom of the PC, the keyboard dropping keystrokes fairly regularly, and the CD drive has locked up to the point where it won't open, and I'm afraid to force it. Another frustrating issue is the trackpad. Even at the beginning it wasn't great, but that was just a lack of responsiveness. Now it will occasionally stop working altogether, necessitating a reboot of the system. I've also noticed a drop in battery life. When I first got the computer I could get about 6 hrs of battery at medium screen brightness. Now it tells me I can get about 4.A small nitpick I have is that I feel for the price an SSD could have been used instead of a HDD.

Asus' warranty alone is worth the low cost. The laptop boots up quickly and installed Win 10 without a problem. Wifi adapter is quick and responsive. Areas for improvement, The keyboard is a bit small for my taste and lacks good key depth while giving off warp when pressing down at the same time. The touchpad is very loud but is responsive to touch. The CPU and ram perform very well and provide quick task loading however some delays have come up with the low RPM hdd. The screen is low on resolution but has good angle viewing and colors. Again for the price I think it would be hard to beat. The computer looks nice and performs as advertised. Double boxed and well packed for shipment.",0,0

ASUS,F554LA-WS52,4,Not a bad laptop,2015-09-17,"Pros:Originally purchased this laptop with the intent of just doing schoolwork on it, so i wasn't expecting much out of it but i figured i may as well test the benchmarks. downloaded a single game (bioshock infinity) off of steam and it ran on ultra at the laptop's max resolution with no lag at all. i didn't really expect that with the integrated graphics but it got 60+ fps.8 gb of ram is enough to multitask without worrying about much","Cons:So far the only cons i found where, updating from windows 8 to 10, took 6-7 failed attempts, and after about 10 hours of retrying i finally got it to process. not sure if it was user error or not.also, you'll experience absolute crippling net speed out of the box. as soon as you get past the setup i suggest updating your network adapter driversalso (doesn't really make much of a noticable difference) update your gpu driver.laptop is light, and the quality at first glance looks very well done but unforunately feels cheap (this isn't really a problem if you take care of your stuff, it won't break)also battery life at 100% says about 6 hours, when in reality it's more around 3.5-4 with medium activity like browsing the web or watching youtube.","Other Thoughts:All in all for what i expected, it's a solid laptop, got it on flash sale for 460, and it's exceeded my expectation for what it's worth on a laptop.- do not expect to buy this laptop and play intensive games on it- do not expect to buy this laptop and do a lot of heavy media editing or rendering- do expect it to be a wonderfully priced school laptop that's well worth the value if that's what you want out of it.In a personal opinion I gave it 4/5 because I had an idea in my head of how it would be, and it reached it. it wasn't perfect, but i'm very happy with my purchase.",1,0

ASUS,F554LA-WS52,5,Good computer for STEM 5th grade,2015-08-30,"Pros:My 11 y.o. Grandson had it up and running as soon after it arrived and with in an hour, had Windows 10 running on it. So it is easy to use. Since it will be carried back and forth to STEM school, weight was an issue, and he said it was light enough. Screen is bright and very readable. All the programs for school were loaded onto the computer during his first day in school and every thing worked just fine, so a good overall choice for a first school laptop.","Cons:Doesn't have an SSD, but that can be added later, if needed.","Other Thoughts:I searched high and low for an appropriate computer that would be 'good enough' for a first-take-to-school computer, and this seemed to be the best fit.

ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,"LightWeight, Portable, Fast",2018-12-23,"Pros:Out of the box this laptop felt lightweight and well built. While being small and portable is was very fast and capable for most tasks including some light gaming. While being small and portable the screen features full HD resolution (1920x1080) and the picture is decent. Battery life was 1.5 -  8 hours in my usage cases, depending on if I was watching videos, playing a game (yes it has nVidia graphics so it can run some games), browsing the web, or working on documents. The backlit keyboard is also a welcome addition. When under load the laptop was not too noisy and didn't seem to get all too hot ( though it did get rather warm under continuous loads).  Windows 10 was not too much of a hassle to get setup and running, and the laptop itself didn't seem to be too loaded down with unwanted software or extras. The speakers also sound decent for their size. The SSD is decent speed wise (sata speeds) and just adds to how well the unit runs overall. It came with a small assortment of accessories, such as a USB to LAN dongle, an HDMI dongle, and a storage sleeve. The fingerprint scanner is nice when it works (see cons).","Cons:I don't have too many complaints about this laptop, however I will list a few things. To start with I don't like having to use dongles since they are sometimes an easy thing to lose. The next would have to be that McAfee came pre-installed on the machine, granted this is a personal preference, I removed it as it has caused me trouble in the past. After that the only other issue I had with software was that after Windows updated, the fingerprint scanner is not always responsive so I found myself typing the password in if I locked the machine, or if it went to sleep, on a fresh reboot it works every time. Noise wise I did notice a very tiny amount of hissing or what people call coil whine if I was close to the laptop when it was under a heavy load (in my case watching a movie laying on my couch). And finally my last nit-pick would be that the top being so glossy and snazzy as it is, it is a total fingerprint magnet and needs wiped down quite a bit. I don't feel it deserves to lose an egg since some of this is personal preference and different usages cases would yield different results.","Other Thoughts:I used this laptop now for about 4 weeks, it has been stable and fast. It's very portable and light. And while it's not a gaming machine, it was able to play some games and handled multimedia, like Youtube, very well. It would be nice if the memory was upgradable, and I could ask for some more ports, but these are the sacrifices made to have an ultra-portable computer. I cannot fault it since it runs fast and is very stable for how much power they have packed into such a small and lightweight machine. I could easily recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a portable, yet high powered laptop, having an i7 and an SSD just make working on it nice and quick with very few if any hiccups. Lastly I will say that it can play games, and will get warm and throttle when doing so, however it's not sold as a gaming laptop, so I have no real complaints with it. It has been a joy to use during all of my testing.Did a little bench-marking as well, results as follows:Geekbench 4 reported the following:Single Core Score: 4755Multi-Core Score: 14372OpenCL Score: 46497Crystal Disk Mark 6.0.2 (with a 4GiB test file) reported the following:Seq Q32T1 Read 556.3 MB/s  Write 454.9 MB/s4KiB Q8T8  Read 396.3 MB/s  Write 280.7 MB/s4KiBQ32T1 Read 196.5 MB/s  Write 201.1 MB/s4KiB Q1T1  Read 25.39 MB/s  Write 47.71 MB/s",4,0

One time I woke up to find that while the computer was sleeping and charging, it had a Windows crash (blue screen error) and it was way too hot to touch and fanning like a leaf-blower which had me concerned that it could have started a fire.","Other Thoughts:Basically, it's a great computer but has these annoying issues which should not happen at this price point, period. I am not sure if I'd recommend it, probably yes but definitely not at full price.",6,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,Powerful performance at a good price and great form factor,2018-11-16,"Pros:Out of the box the computer was not charged at all so make sure to plug it in when you get it.Once I charged it and got it up and running it was the standard windows 10 setup which was painless.The first thing that I did was install chrome and download steam.I tested the computer out by playing civilization VIIt handled the task wonderfully, I had no problem with the quality or the frame-rate even as I progressed through the game and the world became more complicated. While it's not the same quality as my desktop I don't expect that out of this form factor.The size of the laptop is also wonderfully laid out. The screen has a minimal bezel which allows for more screen space with the smaller form factor.Overall this laptop does not let down in terms of performance, the video card paired with the nvidia graphics provide performance in a small form factor along with providing decent battery life on top of that too.",Cons:Your standard issues for any pre installed windows os by including random bloatware. Mcafee is installed and that in itself is more of a virus than antivirus platform in my opinion.One of the other cons is that the top of the laptop is a massive finger print magnet. It is impressive how well fingerprints show up on it. For some that might be really annoying but I couldn't justify taking off any eggs for that.,Other Thoughts:Overall this is a solid offering from Asus. I remember when the first ZenBook came out and I really wanted one. I never had the opportunity to buy one but after reviewing this one I regret not making that more of a priority instead of using arguably mediocre laptops in the meantime.I think this is a solid offering for the price point and the performance. The only thing that I would have liked to see improved is the size of the SSD.,3,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,Great looking featherweight laptop for light to medium workloads,2018-11-15,"Pros:Gorgeous metallic blue finish.Incredibly light, yet very sturdy.Fast and responsiveThere is a USB port on both sides, although only the one on the left is USB3.  There is a USB-C port on left side.Wired Ethernet (via an included adapter) and a wired monitor (micro HDMI, or use the included adapter to convert to standard HDMI) are supported.  There is also an SD card reader, although it is only half as fast as when the same SD card was tested in my desktop.The built-in speakers are surprisingly good, as is the built-in camera.  I really like that there is a small light next to the camera lens that indicates when the camera is in use.I love the fact that there are no air intake vents on the bottom of this laptop since those are so easy to block.  I also love that the hot air exhaust is in the back, aiming up, rather than on the side, cooking my hand as I use a mouse.  The cooling fan (or fans) are dead quite, but I would have preferred better cooling even at the expense of a little of that silence.Goes into and comes out of sleep mode instantly.  So quickly, in fact, I wonder if it is really going completely to sleep.  Like the light in your refrigerator, the screen is on and you're ready to go by the time it is open enough to see it.It comes with a nice carrying pouch, but it is not padded and has no room for the power pack or any of the included adapters.  It will prevent the finish from being scratched when you put it in a backpack, though.","Cons:I hate that Asus and others create special versions of their products for each retailer like this Newegg Exclusive.  It makes it very difficult to compare prices and features, and even harder to find the actual specs.  For example, can the memory be upgraded on this?  You'll never know unless you can figure out how to get it open.  From what I can tell, in addition to the 9 tiny screws on the bottom, you also have to get the rubber feet off the bottom to expose more screws.  Those feet are so well secured, I was afraid I would damage the computer or injure myself so I gave up.  Online comments indicate that the memory cannot be upgraded, but that the M.2 SSD can, although you're back to getting the back cover off.  I wonder if the battery is replaceable?The cooling is seriously insufficient unless you're only going to be doing light-duty work.  Why put an i7 in there if it cooks itself when you actually use it?  After only 10-15 minutes of playing a game that kept the CPU at around 45%, with the laptop on a table, the CPU temperature was in the mid to high 70's (170F), and the bottom of the laptop was almost too hot to touch.  Even the table under the laptop was hot to the touch.  Because the bottom gets so hot, there is no way you could ever use this for any amount of time on your lap.I really don't like the placement of the power button.  It is in the upper right corner of the keyboard, right above the backspace key and right next to the delete key.  Fortunately, since the computer is so fast, it comes right back on after you accidentally hit it, again and again.  You can disable this button in the additional settings section of the power options control panel if you want to.I was  disappointed to find out that this particular version of the ZenBook14 doesn't have the illuminated touch-pad numeric keypad that is all the talk on the ASUS web page.This laptop has quite a large wall-wart power pack, that while rated for 100-240V (50-60Hz), it has a NEMA 1-15 plug that is only suitable for US outlets.  Every other laptop I have ever used has a short region specific cord that goes between the power brick and the outlet, making it more flexible.There is a lot of pre-installed junk on this laptop.  From games like Candy Crush and Mind Craft to trial versions of the entire Microsoft Office suite, there is a lot of wasted disk space here.  It's all easy enough to uninstall though.","Other Thoughts:A PassMark performance test easily shot the CPU temperature to 93C (200F) and drove the GPU temperature to 74C (166F), despite providing only 25 fps in the 3D tests.  At the end of the several minute test, the left side of the keyboard was 42C (108F), and the bottom was 38C (100F).  PassMark gave this laptop (while plugged in) a rating of 3838 and put it in the 78th percentile.  I was surprised by how poorly the memory tested (57th percentile) until I did some research and found it appears to only have DDR3 memory, which seems strange for a gen 8 processor.If you are mostly looking for a light to medium duty, featherweight laptop for surfing the web, watching videos, or using Office-like apps, then this laptop will work great for you.  It will handle heavier work loads for short periods, but I would be afraid of it overheating if used hard for a long time.",8,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,4,Lightweight Premium Build Quality!,2018-11-07,"Pros:Powerful lightweight notebook that is great for everyday use, light/medium video/photo editing, playing/streaming multi-media and even some light/medium gaming!NO bloatware installed, only Asus utilities.Nice 1.4mm travel distance on the keyboard keys.Touch-pad works great and is very responsive, no lag!Amazing matte finish screen completely reduces any glare!Wide viewing angle is perfect when screen sharing with others!Down-firing Harmon/Kardon speakers produce crystal clear sound, and there is no distortion when the volume is turned up.SanDisk X600 series SSD, 256G, M.2 2280 with a sequential read/write of 550/525 is right on with a few Crystal Disk tests I ran, which showed 555 read and around 510 write consistently.No fan ports on bottom or sides. The cooling port is nicely tucked away in the hinge area of the notebook, wherever you are using it there is no need to worry about blocking a ventilation port.Long battery life! I ran this all day alternating between some light gaming, browsing, and streaming videos for a few hours and still had power left to burn. At around 4% the computer will shut down, and it only took about 2 hours to fully charge it to 100% again.The top cover is an eye catching piece of artwork. While it is a fingerprint catcher, you could always find a custom full cover decal to protect it, or try a large generic clear screen protector which may help with fingerprints.Ram cannot be changed out or upgraded; the M.2 SSD can be changed to a larger capacity if you need more space.I have not experienced coil whines, or loud fan issues on the notebook that I tested, even after hours of using it.",Cons:The fingerprint scanner does not work 100% of the time. Not sure if this is a Windows problem or the scanner pad.,"Other Thoughts:If you want to try squeaking more out of the GPU try using Asus GPU Tweak II. It offers one-click custom overclocking with detailed information about the GPU. It can be found on their website.Current Bios version is 305 released 8/16/2018. On their support site, this bios show’s up under the UX430UNR model and not under the UX430UN model.If you want more storage and memory check out the ZenBook UX430UA which has twice as much storage and memory but will cost a lot more!LPDDR3 memory is soldered to the board so the laptop can be made thinner and lighter which allows more space for the largest possible battery. And with lower power consumption it creates less heat while helping extend battery life.Pay attention when using USB-C, as it can also fit into the mini HDMI port!Make sure you pull down all the updates right out of the box before you start using this notebook!!",3,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,4,Very capable Ultrabook that can keep up with the best.,2018-11-01,"Pros:This particular Asus UX430UN has two ideal uses when everything is taken into consideration. 1. Home multimedia (movies, music) & graphical use (photography). 2. Business use with ultimate portability and increased durability requirement.+ Gorgeous matte screen with fantastic color reproduction. The quality of the screen is right in line with the best Ultrabooks. With the screen not having a glossy finish as on most other laptops, the colors may not look quite as rich.+ As somewhat of an overall trend of manufacturers moving from 14” screens to 13.3”, this laptop maintains the larger 14” display with slim bezels. This allows for increased productivity meanwhile keeping the ultimate portability.+ Speakers are second to none in the Ultrabook market. Asus had the space and took advantage of it to install the largest speakers they could. The sound in movies and music is extremely natural and is actually pleasant to listen to. With that being said, even though the speakers are remarkable for an Ultrabook, they will not be replacing any dedicated external speakers.+ Fan noise is much more muted than that of the competition. The laptop prioritizes lower noise over thermals. This is both a pro and a con depending on the ultimate end use / longevity. The processor has a thermal limit of 100*C and the laptop will routinely hit 98*C when under heavy load. The fan will definitely be audible at such loads, but the ramping up will be more gradual than found on the competition’s high performance Ultrabooks.+ Lap friendly design with no cooling vents on the bottom of the laptop. The same cannot be said for most of the competition where such use will block the cooling vents and cause the laptop to run much hotter.+ The base of the laptop is aluminum, the bezel around the screen is plastic, and the lid is a “glass-like” finish. What you essentially get is a laptop that is more forgiving to accidental bumps and better cooling potential due to the aluminum base. Touchscreen laptops on the other hand have glass screens that are much more prone to cracking when bumped or dropped.+ Ambient light sensor for screen brightness control. Upon receipt of the laptop, the maximum brightness of the screen may look dim with the setting turned on. When, turning it off by pressing FN + A key, actual maximum brightness can be achieved.+ Concealed exhaust and intake fan vents for an overall clean look.+ Backlit keyboard with 3 levels of brightness.+ Provided are a laptop sleeve, a Micro HDMI-to-HDMI adapter, and a USB-to-LAN adapter.","Cons:The cons listed should not be deal breakers, but should be taken into consideration when comparing with competitors’ offerings.- Audible coil whine from the motherboard when doing any processor intensive tasks. When fan is on low speed or off, the whine is very much noticeable.- Soldered RAM (8GB) on the motherboard with no option to replace / upgrade to higher capacity.- SATA Based 256GB Sandisk SSD is used in lieu of NVMe based SSD. Even though the slot on the motherboard will allow for SSD upgrades to higher capacity ones, NVMe based drives will not be compatible and cannot be used. To put the raw speed between the two types of drives in perspective, the SATA SSD will top out at around 550MB/s, NVMe SSD will top out at around 3,500MB/s.- Power button is placed above the Backspace key. With the default settings in place, it will put the computer to sleep when pressed. Luckily the default action of the power button can be set to “Do Nothing” within Windows.- Throttling of the processor during prolonged high demand loads. Due to the cooling space constraints, the laptop will slow down to keep it from overheating. This is the case with every other Ultrabook on the market which come with a Core i5-8250u or i7-8550u processor.- The top of the lid has an extremely shiny finish to it that is very much susceptible to scuffs and scratches, and extra care needs to be taken to keep it clean. The new laptop arrived with two noticeable scratches already on the lid. The top should have been kept aluminum with no additional finishes just as found on the aluminum base.- USB port is slightly shorter than standard, this means that anything the user may plug in will stick out a bit more than it should. Wireless mouse receivers that are usually left plugged in will have a higher chance of catching and damaging the USB port.- The fingerprint reader is located on the touchpad. It should have been placed elsewhere on the palm rest or integrated into the power button as on some competitors’ laptops.- No way to cycle the Fn key with F-Key functionality. The only way to change settings such as volume, screen brightness, keyboard backlighting, etc. via the keyboard is to hold down the Fn Key and press the appropriate F-Key. In instances where the user adjusts such settings more often than using the actual F1-F12 keys, there should be an option to just press the appropriate F-key.- Somewhat of an oddity, when the screen is turned off due to inactivity or pressing Fn + F7 key to turn it off, the laptop will turn off the WIFI and act as if it’s half-asleep. If listening to online radio, it will continue playing what has been buffered to that point and then stop due to a lack of network connection. Moving the mouse or pressing any key will prompt you with the login screen. The network connection immediately gets reestablished and the online radio is resumed. Similarly, when doing a large download and leaving the PC unattended, the download will fail when the screen is turned off. This happens with all Sleep settings in the Power Options set to Never. As of right now the only way to avoid this happening is by disabling the Screen Power Off settings and enabling just a Blank screensaver after x amount of time. That of course will reduce the battery life.","Other Thoughts:The following is what is made available on competitors’ Ultrabooks that is not found on this Asus UX430UN: Glossy glass touchscreen with pen support, Fast NVMe SSD, 2-in-1 functions allowing the laptop screen to be rotated 180 degrees and used as a tablet. The additional features will definitely come with a price premium especially when trying to match the exceptional features such as the quad-core i7 processor, 14” screen, and memory on this laptop.As of right now Ultrabook options are abundant and this Asus Ultrabook should not be overlooked.",2,1
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,2,I am not sure...,2018-10-01,Pros:- Super light/thin- Affordable- Relatively good Spec- Nice keyboards,"Cons:- It's 1/2 month-old laptop and it already made the coil noises when updating windows for the first time - concerning.- I have absolutely no idea why but its touchpad freezes for a good minute when loading a webpage on chrome. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!- After spending some time researching, I realised that these issues are common AND unsolvable.- Though it's well-known for a good battery life, I don't experience such long battery life on this.  I haven't gotten a chance to play any games or played videos yet, only websurfing.- Yes, it was GeForce MX150 was one of the main reasons I chose this computer, but apparently it throttles aggressively with high loads (you can easily find other reviews on this issue).","Other Thoughts:- I cannot say that I would recommend this to a friend because of the issues stated above though it's a tempting deal.- I am considering to get an exchange with the same model.

DELL,E6430,5,Good value for the price,2017-11-14,"Pros:Unit is refurbished but I can not see any defects; fast for what I will use it for (I'm not a gamer).  I appreciate that it arrived ""clean"" without any ""bloatware"" that I had to clean out.  Good clean and clear display.  Plenty of memory (4gb) for what I'll use it for.","Cons:The only negative about the product is the ""F"" key's nub (to locate your left index finger) is gone, so I catch myself looking down to be sure I have my hands positioned correctly.  Other than that, it's a bit on the heavy side, but still a good value.",Other Thoughts:I would buy again; the price difference to get similar unit with 500gb hard drive was significant - I can get an external 1tb hard drive for about $50.,0,0
DELL,E6430,5,Great Laptop,2017-11-07,"Pros:- Excellent condition, very few signs of use, looks almost brand new- Packaged carefully and safely- Start-up was simple, & all the drivers and windows updates were pre-installed- Excellent value for money",Cons:- none,Other Thoughts:I am looking to purchase a second laptop for office.

Lenovo,G50,4,Good laptop but problems with arrival,2015-09-23,"Pros:-Excellent laptop for the price. Very fast for managing your stuff, and works well with medium gaming. I play the Clash of kings mod of Mount & Blade warband on high settings with no problems at all.-Nice plug placements.-Slick-looking-Thought there was quite a bit of bloatware, They really didn't give me a problem once I upgraded to W10 and deleted them.","Cons:-After having examined it a little bit, I saw two problems with the screen. First, a vertical line of what I believe must be stuck pixels of green color. There's also a red point around the middle of the screen, but I can only see it when I'm playing a game. Must be something with the graphics card? how can I get a replacement? Is there another way of fixing it? Do I contact Lenovo or Newegg?-Windows gave me some problems with the W8-W10 upgrade but it ended fine as far as I can tell.","Other Thoughts:-The keyboard is quite good, but the mouse-pad is lacking. It sometimes just freaks and you cannot control it. But  who uses mouse-pads for  15.6''s anyway?  The keyboard is space-efficient, but the f1-f12 keys are kinda awkward to use at first, but I guess I'll just get used to it or change my keyboard settings.- Arrived a little late I think. Tho I understand that problems happen.-Screen is ok.",0,0
Lenovo,G50,1,Broken out of the box,2015-06-12,Pros:Product looked good for goo price,Cons:Opened the box and the computer screen wouldn't turn on. I plugged it in into my tv and could see it fine on the tv but not the laptop. I tried calling customer support and was told the product team would call me the next day to try and help me fix it otherwise I could return it for a replacement.

Lenovo,G50,3,"Runs great, just a lot of small issues.",2015-05-18,"Pros:Can't find a more well rounded laptop for this price.I bought it for light gaming, college work and casual web browsing. I can do all three at once with no problems with this laptop.I've had no issues with it. Runs just as well as you'd expect it with it's specifacations.","Cons:This laptop is big, bigger than I thought and causes a couple issues.The keyboard is very spaced out and feels mushy compared to past keyboards I’ve owned.  It takes a bit to get used to.The screen resolution could be better for the size of the laptop. Upon close inspection, it looks slightly stretched out and causes some things to be a little fuzzy.The plastic feels very cheap. There are also some sharp edges at the bottom of the monitor. The exterior Build quality just feels lack luster compared to other laptop's I've owned.The trackpad is unresponsive, I use a mouse while operating the laptop.As others have stated, LOADS of bloatware. Just takes a good 20 minutes to uninstall the various applications.",Other Thoughts:My cons may seem a bit critical but the laptop runs perfectly fine and you can comfortably use it hours on end. It’s just a lot of small issues that add up. I expected a better quality for a 500+ dollar laptop.,4,0
Lenovo,G50,5,Surprisingly good laptop; great value,2015-04-19,"Pros:Lighter than previous laptops (Asus, Acer), very fast boot-up, 1TB drive capacity, very fast SD card transfer speeds, USB 3 works great.Lenovo has fixed that malware issue.The one-button recovery system actually works.","Cons:Of course, Win 8, (what is MS thinking?). Lid/screen somewhat overly flexible upon opening and waggles when there is laptop movement (such as in an airplane, etc..The Win8 setup has you commit to a password tied to a Microsoft email account, but there is nothing in the documentation that tells you the machine will also use that password for the face recognition app.","Other Thoughts:After my first two laptops died from the same thing (power jack failure) I was looking for a replacement that used a different power connector scheme.These have a USB-style rectangular connector instead of the barrel with a pin in the middle.It looks like it may be more forgiving over time and provide (hopefully) longer useful life.Since my last two laptops ended prematurely I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a replacement.This Lenovo G50 was relatively inexpensive, screen looks good, and sound is both wider spectrum AND louder than the previous laptops, a nice surprise, since usually these things have woefully inadequate volume levels.I was able to re-configure Win 8 thanks to a number of web articles, and now have a machine that runs quickly for business and media processing.",1,1
Lenovo,G50,4,So... Much... Bloatware,2015-02-27,"Pros:Speedy, great PC for under 550$. Everything a normal home user would need. I especially like the keyboard. The keys feel soft and are in the computer so my wrists have a place to hit.","Cons:Needs more USB ports. Needs less bloatware, it has so so so so much.",Other Thoughts:Decent computer if you want a broadwell.,2,0
Lenovo,G50,5,Great laptop for the price!,2015-02-23,"Pros:The is a really good laptop for the cost. Loads of bloatware (more on that later), but easy to deal with. And once bloatware is removed, it's pretty fast!I also really like the fact that the laptop drivers are on their own drive partition. No more searching for laptop CDs whenever you want to reinstall Windows.","Cons:Bloatware galore! It bogs the system down considerably, especially during startup.",Other Thoughts:I was able to reinstall Windows 8.1 by using the Windows Installation Media Creation Tool from Microsoft and choosing the correct version of Windows. Just make sure not to overwrite the drive partition that contains the drivers for the laptop.Starting with a clean version of Windows and proper drivers makes this laptop a dream.,6,0
Lenovo,G50,4,,2015-02-22,Pros:No complaints. A great laptop for the price.,"Cons:There is nothing bad to speak of. There is a bit of bloatware, but no more than any other new laptop.",,1,1
Lenovo,G50,2,Good and Bad,2015-02-11,"Pros:I've been running this PC for a week or so and find it to be fast and capable. One thing that really stands out besides the horrible Windows 8.1 is the very poor visual quality of the monitor. It truly is a struggle to get it positioned just right that one can see with any clarity the graphics on the screen. The manufacturer really needs to upgrade this monitor as I rate its quality as ""poor"". The other computer features are ok.",Cons:Windows 8.1 and very poor visual quality of the monitor.,,3,2
Lenovo,G50,4,Perfect Price,2015-02-09,"Pros:--Awesome specs for the price. Got everything I wanted:----8GB of RAM----New Broadwell CPU and it's i5!----New wifi spec: 802.11ac--Fast bootup, like about 5 seconds even with the slow HDD--more on this below in Cons.--Love the button on the left side that boots you straight into the BIOS. No more figuring out which Fn button to hit. Very innovative.--Super easy to swap ANY component--only takes 3 screws. My last laptop took about 20 screws, and 1 screw would say warranty voided if unscrewed. Not here.--Love how Lenovo swaps the function key functionality. Meaning, you can just press the top row function keys to do media functions, without having to hit the Fn button first, and then the function key. Very smart.--Bigger than I thought it would be.","Cons:Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that it has a ton of bloatware, and I couldn't uninstall some it, even with PC Decrapifier, which is insane! And then it would say it was uninstalled, but then when you went back into installed programs, it would still be there, and you could still launch the program!It would take forever to FULLY boot up. Meaning, it takes about 5 seconds to get to the desktop, but then another 10 minutes of background program loading because of the bloatware. The bloatware I think was also the reason why it took forever to shut down the laptop, and each time after literally waiting for about 5 minutes of it saying SHUTTING DOWN, I gave up and just manually held down the power button to shut it down. I ended up swapping the HDD for an SSD and reinstalling windows 8 with a license that I had. Now, this thing is amazing. Would totally buy it again. Lightning quick.","Other Thoughts:I didn't need a gaming laptop. Therefore, for productivity and web surfing at $530, this thing is a steal. I've seen similar specs closer to $1000. Granted, those $1000 laptops are lighter, but whatever. This thing is thin, and light enough, though it is kind of heavy. The non-1080p screen resolution isn't noticeable, which I thought would have annoyed me. However, if you don't have any tech knowledge and a windows license/disk and an SSD, then stay away. I guess I could have tried applying the OEM license, but I've never done that, and I'm not sure if it would've worked.",3,3
Acer,C710-2487,4,It does everything you want using CHROME & GOOGLE,2013-11-05,"Pros:This is great if all you want is to use Chrome & Google.There are other options, but the user in my home has put away his hp and uses this now.I have recommended the Chromebook to several persons who don't need more tools.",Cons:Max volume isn't very loud.Takes a bit to get used to small size - keyboard and screen,,1,0
Acer,C710-2487,5,Great Little Machine,2013-11-03,"Pros:Lightweight, fast, chrome OS, linux compatible",Cons:Battery life is poor for such a small machine,"Other Thoughts:This thing is awesome, hands down. I use this for college and it comes in handy. I was unsure about using chrome OS but I decided to take the plunge (I bought mine used online for $135 so it was a steal). It is linux compatible with a program called crouton. I'm sure there are others out there but this is a pretty popular one. Gives you Ubuntu 12.04 with the option of XFCE or Unity.Now here's the kicker. This is obviously not any sort of desktop replacement or a main laptop replacement. HOWEVER, chrome's remote access app is a game changer in my opinion. You don't have to give up your windows or mac os experience whatsoever. I'm able to remote in to my desktop running windows 7 PREMIUM which by default doesn't have full remote access. However with the chrome app you don't need that feature.As stated above the battery life isn't all that impressive, or even average for a laptop this size. I'm averaging about 4 hours with normal use. That's the only trade off with this chromebook in comparison to other netbooks.   It's nothing to fret over in my opinion. The speed of this laptop is well worth the cost, which is nothing as far as laptops and netbooks go. If you've been on the fence about it, I say go for it. Don't forget to utilize the remote desktop app. You'd be surprised how useful a lot of the chrome apps are.Hope this helps in your decision.",2,0
Acer,C710-2487,4,Great for college students,2013-10-29,"Pros:Small, light, and has a long battery life. With Google Chromebook's you get access programs like Google doc's, spreadsheets etc. and not having to buy additional programs saves a lot of money","Cons:Chromebook's are ""Internet browsers"", meaning you cant download programs not on the Google market place. so no firefox T_T",Other Thoughts:if you do take it back and forth to class try using the offline feature so you can use google doc's when your schools free internet craps out,1,0
Acer,C710-2487,1,"ChromeBook failed in 1st month, Acer TechSupport non-existent",2013-10-25,Pros:Light-weight. Attractive. Easy to use for e-mail and web,"Cons:Stopped working within 1st month: lost power while reading e-mail and would not reboot. Though Chat support worked, the agent suggested I phone Acer Tech Support. Although both the web site and the Chat Agent confirmed my serial number and SNID number, numerous efforts to reach Acer tech support failed with the automated message, ""We do not recognize that SNID.""","Other Thoughts:I researched the ChromeBook before purchase and thought it would be good for simple needs for an elderly friend. Its early failure was a great disappointment, and the impossibility of finding support from Acer was an even greater disappointment.",2,1

Acer,C710-2487,3,It's all relative,2013-07-15,"Pros:Cheap, great hardware.  The perfect laptop to use for school.  Lightning fast, easy apps to use.  You will not get better hardware for the price. I opted to spend the extra 20 dollars to get this particular model (4GB ram), but it probably didn't make much difference","Cons:This was my first experience with a chromebook.  Wasn't really sure what I was getting into when I purchased it, but I figured for the specs I was getting, it'd be worth the price.  There are many limitations to the computer. You can NOT install/use java, or steam (which sucks because I'm into counter strike/other steam games).  There are ways to install Linux onto the chromebook, but unless you really know what you're doing, it can be a pain in the rear for some people.  Even with linux intalled, I was unable to use java. Steam installed but the game's were completely unplayable.  Chromebook gives no way to properly update your video card, or check to see if your drivers are up to date. Also no CD/DVD rom","Other Thoughts:All in all, this is hands down the best laptop on the market for somebody looking for a basic laptop with no gaming. Unless google has an app for it though, don't plan on doing anything outside of basic web-surfing with this laptop.  With linux experience, some of the obstacles can be overcome, but not easy for the average-joe.",3,5

Low cheap RAM should be replaced.,"Other Thoughts:I purchased this, then bought 8GB of RAM and a 64 GB SSD and swapped it with the cheap 320GB hard drive....WOW what a difference...boot times are now less than EIGHT seconds, response times loading up pages are way fast....this little computer is now my regular use at the house for web surfing and working online....if you have the money to pop extra RAM and an SSD into it, do it!!!",5,2
Acer,C710-2487,5,Great Notebook,2013-05-21,"Pros:This chromebook was originally bought for my mother for a birthday gift.  After showing the simple operating system I fell in love with it. Personally, I am a very techy teen (do not judge my review by my age), and it even met my requirements.  The more I used it, the more I realized how much I do on the internet.  Its battery life is amazing, but not an ideal gaming computer.  There is 320 gb of local storage, which is more than enough with the additional 100gb of free storage in google drive.  After one day I have found ""cloud"" replacements for all the things I typically do on the computer.  I would sincerely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a secondary computer/ laptop.  The reason I say this is because of its different local storage system.  Google WILL store all of your music (up to 20,000 songs) and store unlimited amount of normal sized pictures in the cloud.  Call me kooky, but I still like having a computer with the pictures and music physically on it.  My mother uses this chromebook as a visual teaching aid (she is an art teacher), the possibilities with this thing is endless.  In conclusion, no matter your age this is a perfect notebook for you.",Cons:Bottom can get warm after long use.  Doesn't get even as close to as hot as a laptop though.,"Other Thoughts:1.I wrote this review with a chromebook.2.My mother is not good at computers.  She made a google powerpoint the first day she got it, without instruction by me.  This is amazing considering the day before she didn't know how to turn the mac we have for 3 years on or off.3.Just like chrome browser",6,0
Acer,C710-2487,1,A huge disappointment,2013-05-14,"Pros:Nice little alternative to a laptop. Basic, clean, all the staff were disappointed we had to send it back... Nice and shiny is great - when it works.","Cons:The product wouldn't connect to anything we had, I spent a good amount of time researching, calling, and trying to fix the situation even resetting and altering numerous routers. It just plain wouldn't let our employees sign in, and would not connect. Now we have to pay to restock the products and ship them back despite not working as advertised - which quite frankly sucks. I have never had this issue from Newegg before, and I've never gotten so little help from Google before... Very disappointed in both.The thing that really grinds my grits is they won't even try to help us because the product is open. I'm sorry, but I'm not telepathic, I can't tell if a product is going to do what it's supposed to do until I plug in the battery and hit the power button. Most any IT will tell you that's when the fun begins, because it's either gonna work, or you're going to have to run for the nearest extinguisher.","Other Thoughts:It was a pain getting any information on the problem, and some of the help topics drummed up stuff completely irrelevant and out dated to the product itself. When I looked into the product closer, I read from numerous sources that it doesn't even support WPA2 connections and prefers the ever weak WEP. I tried WEP and still couldn't get a solid line to hold. When I expressed that, they said they could test it but that if it connected to one of their routers we'd be billed the stocking fee. If it connects on their end, good for them - but I'm not driving to their warehouse so I can do my job on a product advertised to connect well with what we've got here.",3,5
Acer,C710-2487,5,Overall great computer,2013-05-13,"Pros:Fast, easy to use, easy to maintain, no need to worry about viruses, easy to make the computer as fast as it was out-of-the-box (just clear your cookies/cache), free storage in the Google Cloud, easily manageable files, easy file download, affordable, secure, usable without internet connection","Cons:Can't use tablet, can't use iTunes (but that is not Google's fault, it's Apple's for not having a web-based alternative), can't run programs like Java (due to them being under the same conditions as iTunes), need an internet connection to set up","Other Thoughts:I love this computer, and all the applications I wish to use, I can either find online or a web-based alternative. However, if you have an iPhone, or are planning on getting one, keep in mind that you will not be able to sync your phone with a Chromebook. I would recommend keeping a low-quality laptop or desktop to run iTunes on.",2,0
Acer,C710-2487,5,Great bang for the buck,2013-05-02,"Pros:The cheap, competent netbook has finally arrived. It no longer feels like you have to make major sacrifices on performance to have an inexpensive web browsing system.Perfect for parents or grandparents who just need something to check their email. Rolling updates to the OS ensure they never have to worry about antivirus or exploits. OS Verification ensures you never have to worry about them destroying the system and needing a restore.With ChrUbuntu, this machine gets even better. Nothing you can't do on this. The Celeron is Sandy Bridge based, so you're not exactly settling when it comes to CPU power. (SB Celeron 1.1Ghz is roughly equivalent to a 1.6Ghz Core2Duo) The hardware is very well supported in ChrUbuntu and the only real issue has been some keymappings not carrying over from ChromeOS. (Brightness and volume, for example)Steam for Linux runs well, with some tweaks you can easily get 40-70fps in TF2. More complex maps and maps with higher player limits will cause framerates to drop, obviously. Minecraft gets a very solid 30-40fps.Plays Youtube 720 streams fluidly. (1080 exceeds screen resolution and wouldn't give much benefit in the end unless you use HDMI to a TV, which I don't have the ability to do.)","Cons:Squishy keys, chicklet keyboard, blue LEDs (ugh! stop using blue leds! they suck!), lousy speakers, uneven backlight that is to be expected with cheap laptops. Given what you get for just under 250 bucks, it's hard to fault things like this.","Other Thoughts:Throw in an 8GB stick, install ChrUbuntu on the system and you have yourself an extremely good system for almost a blister-packed-compulse-buy-item on the shelf price.The system is more than good enough that I'm pretty much going to stop advising family members on what other systems to get if all they're going to do is get online. Because no matter how well a Windows system is set up, I still end up having to do tech support. I've always wished I could recommend a system that is completely hands off for me and enough for other people to use when getting online. This is it.",12,1
Acer,C710-2487,5,Works great!,2013-04-24,"Pros:Affordable, zippy, secure, has pretty much every thing you need built in.  I've used several net-book style computers over the years and all the windows based ones tend to be slow and rather annoying to use, and because of the limited power you can't do much but basic word processing and web suffering anyway.  This does all the basic functions that a windows one would but it is much faster and a pleasure to use, and it comes with most of your basic things such as docs, and antivirus built in at no extra costs.  They are Google docs, so you don't have as many features as office, but not that many people use all the added features anyway.  The sound and video is surprising clear for such an inexpensive machine.  If your looking for a computer that will do basic functions and play some games and your favorite music/movie this is defiantly a great option.","Cons:The touch pad takes some getting used to, but that can be fixed with a mouse.","Other Thoughts:Just a clarification on what the other reviewer said about antivirus.  Chrome comes with antivirus built in, so it did come with antivirus.  Also a note it can be used offline (not everything works but you can still type docs and the like).",6,0

Would be nice if it came with a recovery disc.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this item to anyone with a limited budget wanting a basic laptop not for gaming or heavy computing.,0,0
Lenovo,T420,5,Happy With Purchase,2017-11-13,"Pros:First time purchasing a refurbished laptop so I did not have much of a benchmark to compare it too. As a B grade, I expected their to be noticeable wear, however I was pleasantly surprised at how well it looked. I received a better processor than advertised so that was very exciting. Product key is genuine. Came upgraded with dual band wireless! Keyboard is not genuine, however, it has a good feel to it. Battery is about 10% worn and seems to hold a charge for about 3-4 hours. All ports work and screen is in great condition. Laptop is quiet and temperatures are around 40-50 idle and 80-90 load. Came with one stick of 4GB RAM so upgrading to 8 will be easy and cheap. 16 is max but not necessary for my needs.","Cons:There are some cons, but keeping in mind that this is a B grade laptop, I am not going to take away a star for them. I will list them though as I want the next buyer to be aware of what they may find. The biggest con is that the lock mechanism for the DVD-RW drive was broken on arrival. The drive is in there pretty snug, however, it can slide out if the laptop is jostled around. After some research I found that this part can break very easily, and it is part of the back plate so a full tear down is required to fix it. I debated calling Joy Systems about it but decided it was not worth sending the laptop back and having it tore down again. When I replace it with another HDD, I will probably just put some tape over it just to be safe. Some screws are missing from the assembly, but nothing is loose. Small scratches on the body but this is part of the B grade experience, most of them you really have to look for. Small scratch on the LCD in the far corner, but again, B grade experience.","Other Thoughts:Please take my review with a grain of salt as this is the only refurbished laptop I have ever purchased. After doing research on what to expect with a B grade laptop, I feel this laptop is above average. Everything is as advertised, if not greater, and it works very well. Just keep in mind that you are not buying ""like new."" There will be some wear. Also these are not gaming laptops.

Lenovo,T420,5,Happy With Purchase,2017-11-13,"Pros:First time purchasing a refurbished laptop so I did not have much of a benchmark to compare it too. As a B grade, I expected their to be noticeable wear, however I was pleasantly surprised at how well it looked. I received a better processor than advertised so that was very exciting. Product key is genuine. Came upgraded with dual band wireless! Keyboard is not genuine, however, it has a good feel to it. Battery is about 10% worn and seems to hold a charge for about 3-4 hours. All ports work and screen is in great condition. Laptop is quiet and temperatures are around 40-50 idle and 80-90 load. Came with one stick of 4GB RAM so upgrading to 8 will be easy and cheap. 16 is max but not necessary for my needs.","Cons:There are some cons, but keeping in mind that this is a B grade laptop, I am not going to take away a star for them. I will list them though as I want the next buyer to be aware of what they may find. The biggest con is that the lock mechanism for the DVD-RW drive was broken on arrival. The drive is in there pretty snug, however, it can slide out if the laptop is jostled around. After some research I found that this part can break very easily, and it is part of the back plate so a full tear down is required to fix it. I debated calling Joy Systems about it but decided it was not worth sending the laptop back and having it tore down again. When I replace it with another HDD, I will probably just put some tape over it just to be safe. Some screws are missing from the assembly, but nothing is loose. Small scratches on the body but this is part of the B grade experience, most of them you really have to look for. Small scratch on the LCD in the far corner, but again, B grade experience.","Other Thoughts:Please take my review with a grain of salt as this is the only refurbished laptop I have ever purchased. After doing research on what to expect with a B grade laptop, I feel this laptop is above average. Everything is as advertised, if not greater, and it works very well. Just keep in mind that you are not buying ""like new."" There will be some wear. Also these are not gaming laptops. The graphics are great for streaming HD video but you will struggle with most 3D games. This laptop is a beast for school, work, or daily driver.

Lenovo,S500 (59371478),5,Very Impressed,2014-03-04,"Pros:Fast, quiet, Windows 8, touchscreen",Cons:Touchpad is oriented left of center,"Other Thoughts:This machine is perfect.  The hardware is great, it runs extremely fast and quiet, and the touchscreen is superb.For a first time Windows 8 user, I highly suggest watching a Windows 8 tutorial on YouTube and googling for some tips and tricks.  It will save you a bunch of growing pains.I really like the full size number pad being built into the keyboard.  Screen brightness and sound are easily adjusted with the F keys as are many other great features.My only dislikes thus far are the touchpad and the right shift key.  The touchpad is not centered for whatever reason and can be tricky to get used to (left hand may accidentally touch the pad while typing.  Also, the right shift key is half-size.  As someone who always hits shift with their right pinky, I find myself (even as I type this review) constantly hitting forward-slash instead of shift.  I'm sure that you can get used to that fairly quickly though.Overall, this is another excellent Lenovo product.  If you're waffling on what to get, buy this.  I use it for home and occasionally business use and it has far exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend getting this model over a model without a touchscreen.  The touchscreen isn't necessary with Windows 8 but it makes it a lot smoother and improves the overall user experience.  Plus, it's fun!",1,0

When i turned it on, waiting for windows to install its stuff, it had an error saying it wasn't successful, so i restart it  and oddly it booted up windows without a problem, good thing i didn't have to waste time reinstalling windows. Then, i find out i have a defective touchscreen, Thanks to newegg, i returned it to newegg and they gave me a replacement without any stress. So everything was going perfect until i find another problem, i couldn't install windows 8.1, which was really odd because i was able to install 8.1 on the first laptop that was defective... but anyways it still works fine so no big deal, I'll just wait for microsoft to fix the problem.Overall, this laptop is amazing for the price i got it for and the low specs it has, definitly worth buying",0,0

Was not in the US, talked with a tech that had us go through the same thing over and over again.I told her that the computer did not complete sysprep and that it had no recovery partition. She insisted that I try onekey recovery, which did not work. I explained to her that the test software for the video card, touchpad and the sleep state was still on the desktop. She had no idea what I was talking about. I said that it was logging into the built in administrator account and was trying to load the test software on login, again, clueless. I told her I went into the troubleshooter of windows 8 and it did not have the option to ""Reset My PC"" which would indicate that there was no recovery partition on the computer, she started to ask if I deleted the partition, why would I delete the partition that would allow me to reload the operating system incase something went wrong?!I asked her if she could send me a recovery cd/usb so I can just reload the operating system. she me clear the capacitors on the computer and trying onekey again .She finally went to go check if she could send me a recovery cd/usb she said one was not available. Most companies have recovery software that you can purchase or have sent to you to reload the operating system.

A USB drive was plugged into one of the ports and the laptop shutdown.  The next day, the same thing happened but then the laptop wouldn't power on after that.  Before you suggest the battery died coincidentally - it was plugged in when it died both times.  Tried other sockets on different breakers, blah blah blah.  May have been a lemon, may be poor design.A lot of the cost seems to be hogged by an unnecessary touchscreen.  If you have a mouse, why use touchscreen?  If you want a tablet, I'd get a tablet.Not much of a con since it balances out, but no CD drive.  Yeah,yeah, who uses CDs anymore when you can use USB, sure, but it's nice to have if you need it.  On the other hand, you don't have to pay for it if you don't use it.  Decided it was time to own an external CD drive and got one discounted during Black Friday sales.If I hadn't gotten this for 33% off, I would have been disappointed, even if it hadn't broken.  Newegg had stellar customer service regarding the return.Overall thoughts: I got this despite there being practically no reviews after searching google for about 30 minutes.  If yours works, then it may not be a bad laptop.  It seems like it can't make up it's mind if it wants to be a laptop or tablet.Returned for a refund and looked at other options for a similar cost.",0,0
Lenovo,S500 (59371478),4,Good value laptop.,2013-12-07,Pros:I bought this laptop for my girlfriend and for her its really perfect. It has an ultra low voltage processor so it runs very cool yet is still a dual core i3 with hyperthreading so its pretty fast. Will not get hot even when left on a blanket for a long time. Considerably quicker than her old laptop with an AMD chip. The battery life is great even while watching Netflix with a bunch of other tabs open. The screen is nice and clear and works great as a touchscreen windows 8 device. I'm used to my 1080p screen and I cant tell the difference. HD 4000 suits her needs as the only gaming she does is The Sims and maybe some Roller Coaster Tycoon 2.,"Cons:For her this laptop is perfect but I'm used to my desktop with a GTX760 =). Had a problem with the wireless internet cutting in and out until I updated drivers and turned off the wifi power saving mode. The Lenovo website wasn't much help, I just downloaded a free driver update utility. Came with some bloatware but that's expected for laptops.

HP,8570P,5,Really Great~,2017-10-14,Pros:Value3rd party vendor service response3rd party tech support,Cons:Condition,"Other Thoughts:If you're like me you want value over cosmetics. This unit did arrive with a substantial ding in one corner. Otherwise, this machine is a speed demon. Cold boot in 10secs. Rips open apps and connectivity is great, this model's hardware though about 4 years old, with win10 installed is right up there with the latest offerings. The only thing missing was built is Bluetooth and a backlit display However HP includes a slick built in, a hidden keyboard light. It;s totally cool! HP installed a slick LED keyboard .Press the button near the mic and voila. Other than that this is a perfect supplement for a desktop machine. The i7 processor is quick. No lag in launching or downloading or anything. Joy systems is great and immediately responsive with email. I was worried that the battery would come depleted and dead alas, it's fully chargeable and holds that charge like new. 4.5 hours with low power settings. It's hit or miss with these refurbs. I bought one from a different vendor and it was a total bust. This one is like striking gold.",2,0

HP,8570P,5,"Great Computer, works like I need it to1",2017-09-08,"Pros:Needed a new laptop after the old one died.  Read reviews and product specs and chose this one because it seemed that it would fit my needs.  It works great, I am able to do everything I need with it.  Refurbished price was a bonus!",Cons:It's really heavy for a laptop,,2,0
HP,8570P,5,So far so good,2017-09-01,"Pros:-A very study laptop.  Looks like it could take a beating, which is one thing I really like about this.-The keys press very well-The system itself is very quick and very quiet-Shipment was quick-For the price, this is a very good deal-No scratches at all on the product itself, which is rare with refurbished items","Cons:-The sticker on the computer said i5, but after checking the system itself, it is confirmed to have all the specs promised in the discription","Other Thoughts:This is a great laptop and I would recommend this to anyone who needs something cheap but with a lot of firepower.  The seller itself seems to do a great job making sure their systems are strong before sending them out, which is not always guaranteed with refurbishes.",4,0

HP,8570P,5,Checks all the boxes at a bargain price.,2017-08-19,"Pros:Easy to remove back cover and work on machine.Powerful and fast.Adequate memory and SSD storage.Nice screen.Additional USB 3.0 ports can be added via the express card slot, if desired.Has SD card slot.Has plenty of ports for most needs, can't think of any lacking, even has a serial port, plus a VGA in addition to the DP.I like the keyboard.  I am a touch typist from the old days, cut my teeth on manual typewriters and on IBM Selectrics and Executives, and for a laptop keyboard, I can't complain about this one.  It has a nice feel.","Cons:I removed the back cover on receipt and noticed dust in the cpu cooling fan blades.  Dust bunnies.  I cleaned the fan with compressed air.Scratches on case are not an issue for me, but some might not like the little dents and dings.  I personally don't think it's relevant at all.No HDMI port.  But, has the DP (display port) which is probably better, but most, like me, probably have more HDMI cords laying around than DP.  Also has VGA port.I wouldn't stray too far from a power source.","Other Thoughts:My unit came through in good condition.  The screen is excellent, with no scratches or issues.  The case is dinged, scraped and dented a little bit, but that is a non-issue, it just doesn't matter to me.  The keyboard is in excellent condition, with good lettering on the keys.  It looks almost new, except examined under the right light, you can see the shine from previous use.My unit came through with the 3740qm cpu chip, which is nice, and a discrete AMD graphics card.  It also has the full HD screen which is 1920 by 1080, and it is a low-glare screen.  It's nice screen, not like on cheap budget laptops.  Nothing against budget laptops, they have their place.  The screen has a feature called ""night light"", which removes a lot of the bluish light, and this can be set for certain times of day, or just left on or off.This machine is really fast.  I expect it to do well with the limited type of photo editing I plan on.  This a lot of machine.",0,0
HP,8570P,5,Very satisfied.,2016-10-08,"Pros:This is my first laptop I've ever owned as I've always built desktops, but the need for a good laptop finally overcame me.  I didn't want to spend a fortune but wanted something that was still powerful enough to have fun with. This one definitely meets that.  Strong processor that doesn't get too crazy hot, although it does eat at the battery pretty good when not plugged in.  Screen is 1080p and looks great, and overall even being a ""B grade"" the whole laptop is in great condition. Very few nicks and bumps in the chassis and everything works as it should.","Cons:Only con to this laptop was the Chinese generic power adaptor it comes with, but it works and is at oem spec for voltage and amperage so hardly worth actually complaining about.",Other Thoughts:My particular laptop ended up coming with a 3740qm processor in it which is a slightly faster version of the 3720 (nice surprise bonus!) as well as a discrete amd graphics setup that well outperforms the Intel hd 4000 integrated I had read these usually come with.

The optional dock for home use is quite useful, giving you more ports and can be used with up to a WQHD (but not 4K at 60Hz) screen.You have to ask yourself if you can live without a webcam and more importantly a USB port on the go. The USB port is available if you want to carry a tiny dongle (included) as well.The many pros of having something so light and transportable must outweigh your need for ports on the go.",2,0
ASUS,B9440UA-XS51,4,"Wonderful, if narrow in purpose",2018-02-10,Pros:It has a great feel in hand. Beautifully made. The keyboard is gentle and responsive. Very comfortable for just having in your lap. The speakers are really impressive. Never would have expected such full sound from such a tiny machine.,"Cons:*Only two ports (beside the mic/headphones jack), they are both USB-C, and one is meant for charging.*The track pad is not great. Seems to have trouble distinguishing button click from a multi-touch gesture, which makes navigating scroll bars tricky. It also seems to be a bit finicky - if your finger is too dry, or a bit sweaty, it starts having a but of trouble following your movements. Not a major problem, just an occasional minor annoyance.","Other Thoughts:It is really meant to be an on-the-go machine. Moderate performance specs, long battery life, and minimal attention for peripherals. If you just need something to toss in a bag, this is great. If you expect more functionality, you might feel a bit limited.Thoughts after owning it for a few months:*The sole audio jack accepts either a mic or headphones. It does not seem to work with a combination device, which is a puzzling choice considering there's just one port.*Even though it charges through a USB port, it still accepts only the manufacturer power supply. It would have been amazing if you could use any USB charger. A great opportunity missed.*Having just one USB-C port generally available peripherals is not a big deal. For home, I got a USB-C / USB-A hub. When away, I don't really use peripherals anyway.*It did have a failure - it wouldn't charge anymore. Getting warranty support was a bit cumbersome, and I had to ship the unit to them. They did turn it around fairly quickly, though.",9,0
ASUS,B9440UA-XS51,5,Super light and full HD screen,2017-08-24,Pros:- Very light- Full HD screen (1920x1080)- Backlit keyboard- Impressive sound- Seems fast enough for business use- Includes Windows 10 Pro- Power socket can be used as USB-C port when not charging- Touchpad has two finger right-click and drag- Plenty of memory- Headphone jack built in,"Cons:- When not plugged in, only two USB-C ports are available directly on the laptop. The adapter (included) must be used for USB-A and HDMI. You should also purchase a USB-C to USB-A multi-port adapter if you're using multiple USB devices.- No SD card port. You will need a separate USB card reader.- No CD\DVD player.- No separate number pad on keyboard. Not a big deal considering the small size.- Somewhat expensive",Other Thoughts:- Good travel computer- About 5 hours of battery life,3,0

There are no usb ports on the computer itself, you have to plug in an external port, which has only one usb port and then it did not always allow you to disconnect, forcing me to remove the flash drive without disconnecting.  Having to have external equipment is a pain.  I also had difficulty connecting to some internet sites, like YouTube and Microsoft.

DELL,e6420,5,Product more than advertised,2018-08-09,"Pros:Computer out of the box only took 1/2 to setup and get running. Microsoft registration already done.

DELL,e6420,4,Good value.,2018-07-16,Pros:-Came as advertised. A few small scuff/scratches on the sides of the unit but otherwise cosmetically in good shape. No issues with the display or otherwise.-Came with an original Dell charger. Not a cheap aftermarket one.-Battery came with a modest 13% wear level so I would assume this was a lightly used unit.-Laptop feels solid. Hinges are still stiff with no play.-The i5 2520m does reasonably well for day to day tasks. It is possible to upgrade this unit to a 2760QM(4c/8t) processor if you require additional processing power.,"Cons:-The included hard drive is terribly slow as is the case with most laptop hard drives. Highly recommend an SSD upgrade.-Migrating the preinstalled Windows 10 to a new SSD was a frustrating experience. Laptop would not recognize the new drive via USB when trying to clone the main drive. Apparently this is a Windows 10 issue and not an issue with this laptop. However, when I tried to install the new drive via a hard drive caddy that fits in the DVD drive slot I found that this Dell uses a proprietary DVD drive that is smaller/thinner than the standard one so I was back to square one. At this point I just gave up and a did a full reinstall on the new drive.-Charging port has some play and feels sloppy. The charger plug doesn't fit snugly in there. This may present a longevity issue with the laptop in time.",Other Thoughts:Overall this is a nice buy depending on what you need. The refurbishing process seems to be done well as this is my second purchase and both have been good units with very little wear and tear. This is not a gaming laptop at all but would work great as a daily use PC or something to travel with. For the price you can't beat it.,2,0

After looking at the screens for a long time I finally noticed that one of them had a couple of very small and barely noticeable dull spots.

ASUS,S510UN-DB55,4,Great Little ASUS,2019-02-26,"Pros:When I first received this laptop, I was very amazed on how light the box was(I come from the world of Mobile desktop laptops that weigh 40lbs)Anyway, upon opening the box I see a sexy sleek laptop and a charger I said wow that’s it,Done are the days when you receive tons of disks and paperwork with new computers.(This laptop doesn’t come with a disk drive… What’s a disk drive?)Very well-appointed laptop nice build quality and has all the i/o ports you will need and a SD Card slot.Backlit Key board for the WIN!!!!!  Yes, finally a laptop under 500$ with a backlit keyboard.Performance wise its good but don’t think you’re going to edit video on it.Gaming well it works I can play Farming Sim 2018 and SimCity on full specs but I would believe faster moving games would task this little laptop that being said this is not a full on gaming laptop so…Upgradable RamUpgradable M.2 SSDUpgradable 2.5 SATA-III Drive.","Cons:The Largest downfall of this laptop is the 1TB 5400RPM platter drive man its slow it helps with the 16 GB M.2 SSD “intel optane” (which is being used as a Ram/Cache) but it would be so much faster with a SSD in place of that Platter Drive.Better yet install a larger M.2 SSD used as the Boot drive and a 1tb 2.5 SSD but once you spec those items in the price of the laptop skyrockets, but the cool part is upgrading these item as you can afford to down the road would make this laptop a small power house.I truly believe ASUS could have went with a better platter drive maybe something 7200 rpm for the base configuration and still make money.(This is my Reason for 4 stars)","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this laptop or any other version/configuration of this laptop to all students really anyone that needs a good, fast, small, lightweight laptop with the ability to do moderate gaming.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-DB55,5,Excellent all around laptop and great value,2019-02-11,"Pros:Design:The ASUS S510UN-DB55 comes with a very slick looking silver, aluminum top to protect the display, whereas the case is plastic, painted a matching silver color. I wish the entire case was aluminum, but some is better than nothing and it is a welcome touch at this price range.This is a light ultra-book weighing less than 3lbs with a well designed keyboard with a full backspace key, however unfortunately no number pad - I would have preferred a number pad for gaming, but the NVIDIA GeForce MX150 will only average you 30fps in GTA V or Tomb Raider, so it's not really ideal for gaming anyway. It's still more than capable of running something like Fortnite, though.The touchpad is large and responsive with support for standard multi-touch.The keyboard feels relatively solid with a firm back support.Installation:This laptop is ready to go out of the box, after going through a few of Windows 10 Cortana data gathering prompts.Software:The S510UN-DB55 comes with Windows 10 Home. I installed ClassicShell out of the box to replace the cluttered interface.Storage: The S510UN-DB55 comes with a 1TB drive, with 960GB actual space and 893GB free out of the box - a decent amount. The shining jewel of this laptop is that it is powered by 16GB of Intel's much hyped Optane memory. Intel Optane was developed in conjunction with US-based Micron Technology as a new memory type called 3D XPoint. It serves to essentially replace DRAM by offering performance close to DRAM memory, while offering all of the permanent storage benefits of NAND. ASUS used this ultra-fast Optane memory to replace the 16GB of DRAM typically found in a laptop and ship it with 4GB+16GB of Optane - a less expensive option. How does this impact performance?Speed:Here is how performance compared with and without Optane installed:S510UN-DB55 with 16GB Optane (Toshiba MQ04ABF100 1TB, 128MB Cache, 5400 RPM)Startup Time (to Windows login screen): 12sCrystalDiskMarkSeq: Read 894.0 MB/s / Write 157.5 MB/s4K: Read 177.9 MB/s / Write 88.32 MB/sHDTuneMin Transfer rate: 10.8MB/sMax Transfer rate: 140.1MB/sAverage: 93.3MB/sAccess Time: 18.8msCPU Usage: 12.7%S510UN-DB55 without 16GB Optane (Toshiba MQ04ABF100 1TB, 128MB Cache, 5400 RPM)Startup Time (to Windows login screen): 24sCrystalDiskMarkSeq: Read 69.40 MB/s / Write 23.48 MB/s4K: Read 0.282 MB/s / Write 0.247 MB/sHDTuneMin Transfer rate: 6.0MB/sMax Transfer rate: 77.7MB/sAverage: 29.5MB/sAccess Time: 29.1msCPU Usage: 2.7%1GB Large File Copy test: 31s515MB Small File Copy test (<100kb files): 5m 36sAs you can see, the boost from Optane is tremendous! Real world performance feels just as snappy as an SSD with the added storage space of a HD.Display: Display is a vibrant 1920 x 1080 IPS display. From other sites, it offers a 72% color gamut.Sound: Quality is okay. Loudness is good. The S510UN-DB15 is at least 30% louder than the F510UA I had before. If you need it louder, you can download the ICEpower application and adjust the equalizer. Unfortunately, speaker placement is poor - speakers are underneath in the front, which makes it a real problem if you are going to watch or listen to something on any non-flat surface (i.e. your bed).Battery life:Full-screen video playing : 4hrs 5minUpgradability:-2 x SO-DIMM PC4 DDR4 2400T memory slots. 1 slot being used by a 4GB Samsung memory module.-1 x M.2 2280 SATA III slot that is being used by the 16GB Optane module.

Great IPS display, large and fast storage, excellent battery life, video capable of light gaming or HD video and decent sound. More RAM would not hurt, but there is space to pop in another module for very little money. Overall an excellent laptop.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-DB55,5,ASUS VivoBook,2019-02-11,"Pros:The ASUS Vivobook is a great laptop.  There is a lot to like.  The build quality can easily be compared to a certain rival ""fruit"" company, I won't name, who's comparable product easily cost 2 or 3 times as much.  The VivoBook has an aesthetically beautiful frame.  The shell is seamless and the top has a metallic look, touch and feel.  The build is solid.  It's not too heavy but it does have a noticeable weight and I think it's due to the battery and the additional nVidia MX150 video card built-in.  This particular model has a 15 inch screen which, in my opinion, means it crosses the line into the ""less portable"" class.  But I guarantee you, it feels portable.  Most people won't be embarrassed to carry it around and it fits very well in a small-ish backpack.  Side note, my 3 year old 15inch gaming laptop does NOT fit in the backpack... the VivoBook's very thin frame made all the difference.  With an enormous battery life, there may not be a need to carry around the power adapter.  Even though the adapter itself is takes up very little space.As far as features go, there's plenty to love.  Three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI video output, 1080P native resolution, nVidia MX150 GPU (2GB VRAM), a very desirable USB-C connection (for docking, etc.) and a 1TB HDD with a 16GB Intel Optane card.  The fingerprint reader built-in to the touchpad is perfect, subtle and not an eyesore.  The keyboard is great to type on.  The keys have a light touch.  The Optane card is designed to automatically store the most widely accessed files, kind of like an extension to the 1TB HDD, but has the speed of an M.2 SSD.  This makes the ASUS VivoBook start up very fast, just a few seconds.  And using the fingerprint reader logs into Windows instantly.  This is a very welcome feature.  The display screen has a 1920 x 1080 resolution.  Brightness and color are very good and there is no edge bleeding.  The nVidia MX150 GPU (video card) is also a nice feature, but mostly a benefit to graphics applications, video streaming and some video gaming.  The audio is crisp and clear.","Cons:The biggest drawback of the ASUS VivoBook is the 4GB of system RAM that it comes with.  Product info seems to allude the 16GB on the optane card is in addition to the 4GB.  While the optane card is helpful for mainly bootup times, 4GB of RAM by today's standards may not be enough.  Heavy Internet users who never close browsers could possibly experience applications getting hung up due to low memory availability.  But if 4GB turns out to be not enough, the RAM chip can be upgraded.The operating system is Windows 10 Home.  While this is fine for most people, I would have preferred Windows 10 Pro pre-installed in case I wanted to connect the ASUS VivoBook to a Windows domain work environment. Windows 10 home can always be upgraded to Pro but at a cost.Like all computer brands, pre-loaded software is fairly typical. The ASUS software is fine and does not take up too much of a footprint, but I prefer using Windows 10 built-in Defender anti-virus over the one that was pre-installed.","Other Thoughts:Overall the ASUS VivoBook is full of features and can be great to use at home or on the go.  Even with a 15 inch screen, it's portable enough and stylish enough to carry around.  In case anyone is interested, I did try its gaming capabilities.  It is definitely not a gaming laptop, so don't plan on playing any modern AAA games with it.  Most of the modern AAA games require much more DRAM and VRAM.  However, I did try Fortnite and surprisingly it ran fairly smooth at a 1080 resolution but most of the graphics quality settings had to be turned down to medium or lower.  So I imagine less graphics intensive games and modern 2D side scrolling games will run just fine on the nVidia MX150 card.In conclusion, The ASUS VivoBook is a very reasonably priced top-notch laptop.  And the attractive / quality design with an 8th gen core i5 processor makes it a great buy.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-DB55,4,Great Product easy to use long time to install all the updates,2019-02-05,"Pros:Nice looking, lightweight, fast charging, long lasting battery. Best trackpad I’ve ever used. Windows 10 worked flawlessly, I did do all updates before really using it. They took a long time. It would have been faster to just use the media creation tool to reinstall Windows. I never had any crashes with this and I have had it about 2 weeks now and have done all the updates from Windows and Asus including updating Bios to 306 and windows to 1809. So I don't understand others having so many troubles or saying the machine is worthless without upgrading the ram.","Cons:The things I didn’t like but understand is the back cover. There is no easy access to ram, battery or the hard drive. To get to anything you have to remove the whole back cover which is made harder by the two hidden screws under the back pads. While I understand this was to keep it thin and light weight the hidden screws are stupid to me as there are other screws right next to it.I do miss having indicator lights on top front to see power and hard drive activity like on my other laptop.","Other Thoughts:As far as laptops go this one is great just missing a touchscreen. The sound is awesome, could not believe how good it sounds. It is so light it is easy to move around with just one hand with an open screen. The bios protects you from outside booting so if you want to boot from a usb device you must disable protection in the bios. Also if you want to remove the 16gb optane memory it looks like you can easily change settings to ACHI also in the bios but haven't tried it yet. Bios also was updated as it was outdated.All in all I think most people will be happy with it even with just 4gb ram.Asus says it will support 16gb but i bet it will do 32gb because intel says the cpu can address 32gb. I've not tested that on this laptop but have on others where the manufacturer says one thing and intel says more and more has always worked for me.As far as the battery is concerned it may last 8 hours like asus says but i've only got about 4 with constant use of web browsing and solitare.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-DB55,4,Fantastic value for money with one major caveat,2019-02-04,"Pros:TL/DR; Useless laptop as shipped. Add a $30 4GB memory stick and the Asus S510UN has unbeatable performance for the price.Powerful laptops that are thin and light, have large displays with small bezels, good keyboards and trackpads, and a reasonable complement of ports are certainly available. Dell’s XPS series, Lenovo Thinkpad X, and the HP Elitebook are examples of the type. None, however, is exactly budget priced.With the VivoBook S510UN, Asus attempts to provide a thin and light laptop that saves money in nonessential areas. You won’t confuse it with a class-leading notebook, but the S510UN is perfect for students or anyone else looking to maximize their spending power. This review comes with a caveat: you need to budget an additional $25-30 for a second 4GB memory stick. As sold, the S510UN is not really functional. More details below.The Asus S510UN makes a good first impression. The screen bezels are not as small as on an XPS but they are far thinner than anything else in this price range. Combine that with an intelligent hinge and actual screen size is larger than normal for this size notebook. The screen itself is reasonably good, with normal viewing angles and a measured sRGB gamut coverage of 90%. No, it isn’t a touch screen - Asus is keeping costs low here.Typing is aided by a well-angled keyboard. The keys themselves are OK - not stellar travel but better than most. The closest comparison I have is to an original Macbook Air. The trackpad thankfully uses Microsoft’s Precision tracking. I had no complaints with it in terms of tracking, gestures, or palm rejection. The integrated fingerprint reader works with Windows Hello. Recognition is useable - recognizing a fingerprint about 75% of the time - albeit not at Dell levels.Graphics performance is definitely aided by the Nvidia MX150 GPU. In this regard, the Asus notebook outperforms the 3x more costly thin-and-light competition. Processor performance also is quite good until you run a program that maxes out the CPU for more than 3-4 minutes. At this point, the fan is blowing on full and the CPU starts throttling. Normal office work, watching videos, and light gaming all work well.The included hard drive offers indifferent performance even by 5400 RPM standards. In most usage, however, this isn’t an issue. The 16GB Optane drive caches remarkably well. Enough so that you’ll forget that the main drive is a slow disk - at least until you read a large file that is not cached.Asus also includes a good selection of ports. There are a pair of USB 2 ports, the obligatory SD card slot, one each USB 3 and USB 3.1 Type-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack. I would have preferred more USB 3 rather than the USB 2, but you shouldn’t need to carry a batch of dongles to attach peripherals.Finally, battery life is good albeit not great. I consistently achieved 6 hours on a charge with light to moderate usage. Load the CPU enough so the fan starts blowing audibly and battery life dropped to 4-5 hours. In other words, enough to get a student through classes; business shoppers looking for extended operation on long flights should look elsewhere.","Cons:The primary flaw of the Asus S510UN is that it ships with a paltry 4GB of system memory. Initial boot and account setup worked perfectly well. I updated the BIOS and Asus drivers. Still no problems. Installing the January cumulative update to Windows 1809, however, brought about frequent blue screens. The cause was the Nvidia MX150 driver starving for memory and crashing. I could fix the blue screens by disabling the Nvidia GPU but that loses a primary selling point of this laptop.I tried resetting Windows to base Microsoft install and then completely reinstalling Windows from scratch. In both cases installing the January 1809 update pack led to blue screens. The system crashes were not infrequent. Only rarely could I use the S510UN for five minutes between blue screens.I then installed a second 4GB memory module. Note that the S510UN uses 2400T memory (Samsung M471A244CB0-CRC). The Samsung module is available here on Newegg (although from a third party); I used a Crucial CT4G4SFS624A memory stick because that what was sitting on a shelf in the office. It worked perfectly. Not a single blue screen or other crash since (Windows was thoroughly corrupted by then so I did a clean reinstall).Build quality can be summarized as “good enough.” You won’t confuse the Asus S510UN for a Thinkpad X1 Carbon or an XPS. The lid is brushed aluminum, the base all plastic. Use the S510UN on your lap and it flexes more than a comparably light $1500 laptop. Thankfully neither the lid nor the keyboard deck are fingerprint magnets.The keyboard layout is good for the most part. Asus added dedicated Home, Page Up and Down, and End buttons. These are arrayed in a column along the right edge of the keyboard. The power button is placed in the same grid as the other keys; more than once I put the laptop to sleep when I meant to press Del or Home instead.The power adapter is housed in a huge wall wart. Not only can it be difficult to fit when other devices are plugged in to a power strip, but the power brick is heavy enough that it easily falls out of well-used outlets.Sound is a final issue with the S510UN. The speakers are on the bottom of the laptop and at the best sound as though they were picked based solely on low cost. Sitting on a desk, the sound is anemic. On your lap, it’s hopeless. The screen is perfectly good for watching movies on. Just use the headphone jack, external speakers, or your bluetooth earbuds.","Other Thoughts:My 4-star rating is most definitely grading on a curve. Compare the Asus S510UN to high end laptops and it will end up last. That said, the S510UN strikes an excellent compromise between price and a laptop that can be used on the go without weighing down your bag. I deducted a star because of the memory issue. If you order the S510UN, make sure to add a 4GB memory stick to your Newegg cart.You certainly can improve on the base configuration. The S510UN can hold up to 16GB of memory and swapping the HDD for a SSD seriously improves performance. If you have an older SSD handy, I recommend the exchange. Paired with the Optane cache, even an older SSD gives real-world performance rivaling that of modern high end NVMe drives. Just be sure to keep track of where each screw came from. Asus uses three different sizes for the case bottom and two for holding the drive cage.Looking at the prices for higher spec versions of the VivoBook, the value proposition isn’t as clear. Prices edge closer to Dell, HP, etc. territory to the point where $100 more gets you a significantly better laptop.One last comment regarding Asus-installed bloatware. It’s there, and some of it could potentially be useful. I opted to reset Windows to start with a clean slate. Back up the Driverstore folder first, and after the reset, update any missing drivers highlighted in Device Manager using the Driverstore backup before updating Windows. Microsoft guessed wrong with one of the drivers through Windows Update. You will also need to install the ATK utilities from the Asus website to get the hotkeys and keyboard illumination working.",2,0

ASUS,S510UN-DB55,5,Great for price but prepare to buy upgrade parts when ordering.,2019-01-06,"Pros:Light weight, MX150 is perfect for mid range gaming. Averaging 6-7 hour battery life when traveling and web browsing. One of the best trackpads for sub 600 dollar PC. Have played a variety of mid level and indie games without issue.  Single fan exhaust to back of laptop.",Cons:-Wish they simply included 8 gb of DDR4 ram as standard.-Temperature not to my liking causing fan to spool up under low load.-Opening the backpanel is a little hassle as they have 2 hidden screws and many plastic clips that you need to carefully pry open.,"Other Thoughts:As title described, be ready to buy some upgrade parts. For me, 1 stick of Crucial 8GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) DR x8 SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD824A for 50 dollars was immediate with intention to by a second stick in future. PC only has 1 copper heat pipe run between the MX150 and CPU. I re-applied the thermal paste with thermal grizzly kryonaught. This dropped temps 6-7C on idle and about 9C on full 100% load. This added significant battery life as the cpu/gpu fan barely runs on web browsing or using microsoft office.   I decided to keep the optane and 1 TB which seems to do a pretty great job after opening your software and few times. Boot times are similar to SSD with optane memory in use. My laptop also needed to connect to wired connections for some work applications so a usb to RJ45 adapter was also necessary.",7,0

Glass track pad with fingerprint scanner works well.","Cons:16gb of Optane does not work as the ""4 GB DDR4 + 16 GB Intel Optane"" of RAM as the title suggests. and the system fails to work properly and freezes, locks up and crashes frequently even under very minor loads such as: having one tab of chrome open and one small file download (30mb) going at the same time. OR having one youtube video running and without network problems, the computer cannot handle the video playback and freezes, glitches, and stops for 30seconds only to switch to 360p after 5mins of perfectly uninterrupted 1080p playback. (the native resolution of the display is 1080p).","Other Thoughts:Next time ASUS, focus on adding $25 of ram to your laptop, and not a brushed aluminium backed display and a fingerprint scanner.",3,3

Education edition windows keys can only be sold to schools meaning no business or consumer can own one. It goes against Microsoft's terms of service. I contacted Newegg over the situation. They offered me a refund which is fine. However, they could not give me an answer if I could order another one with the correct product key. They had no way of knowing since my laptop had been labeled incorrectly. This means others of this model could be that way too. This was a simple clerical error, but I did want to point it out to any buyers. Check your System information, make sure it says ""Windows 10 Pro"" and not ""Windows 10 Pro Education"". A secondary check is to look at the bottom windows sticker on your laptop. If the sticker says education, then I recommend sending it back.Other then the Windows key issue.........fantastic laptop for the price.",,1,1

What I didn't expect was how fast the 8250 processor is, the backlit keyboard, the standard laptop drive bay in addition to the M2 bay.As mentioned above, to turn off secure boot, the BIOS requires setting a BIOS password, but there's nothing in the documentation about that quirk.  This unit comes with a small M2 drive (128GB) but with the available HD bay it's no longer an issue. I've got my OS and home directory on the M2 and all the rest on a 2TB spinning drive.

ASUS,P2540NV-YH21,3,"Good Price for a lightweight powerhouse, but the touchpad.... oh my",2017-08-26,Pros:- Dedicated GPU- Lightweight- Removable Battery- DVD Drive?- Battery life is fantastic- Bang for buck is really good,"Cons:- The TRACKPAD. OH LORD THE TRACKPAD. This thing is impossible. I even went out of my way to research forums about BIOS updates, ATK driver uninstall/reinstall, ELAN drivers instead of Smart Gesture. This thing is an absolute nightmare out of the box and is practically a deal breaker for me. I use an external mouse to do anything on a server RDP session, out of fear that the trackpad will just ""jump"" and cause undesired effects. I really wish I was exaggerating but this is by far the worst touchpad on the market. I have owned over a dozen laptops myself, and serviced a few thousand more throughout my career, and this touchpad is definitely the worst of the batch. Seriously.- DVD Drive? Who really needs this?","Other Thoughts:- If by some miracle ASUS decides to produce a even remotely decent smart gesture driver, it could possibly save this touchpad. However the completely neutered driver gives a laughable amount of customization, only leaving you looking for the 'other' part that gives you what you were looking for, such as coasting, scroll speed, sensitivity, dead zone, etc. (it dosen't exist, only in the registry, with a different driver, and it still isn't good)- I really do want to like this laptop, and if the touchpad wasn't what it is, I would say this is a fantastic laptop. however, as described above, the touchpad is a backbreaking flaw and I would definitely avoid it unless you have no need for a touchpad.",3,0
ASUS,P2540NV-YH21,5,"Great specs for the money, small compromises",2017-08-20,"Pros:- Can't beat the specs for the money- Great battery life (Haven't tested it but it is rated at 18 hours)- Have had no problems in the 3 weeks I've had it so far and I don't expect problems long term since Asus has been placing second after Apple in recent reliability surveys and this is their pro line so it should be built for reliability.- Keyboard and touchpad feel good- All the ports! (4 USB, HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, SD card...)- Fingerprint sensor works fast!- Computer is all plastic but the texturing on the plastic is done very well and looks and feels nice.","Cons:- It is thicker than it looks in the photos. The battery is a bit thicker than the rest of the computer.- Mediocre screen - color reproduction and clarity could be better. I could be biased here since I prefer glossy screens and this one is matte- Mediocre webcam - It gets the job done but if you are in a video call with somebody who is on a Mac, it is obvious that the resolution and dynamic range of your webcam is worse than theirs.","Other Thoughts:Even though I list some cons, I give this laptop 5 eggs since I think they are a worthwhile compromise for the price.

Lenovo,t420,5,Really good refurbished business laptop,2017-02-27,Pros:It's a Thinkpad.Comes with a Windows 10 Pro License (Not home as it's mentioned)Modern enough to do mostly everything you need short of hardcore gaming.,Cons:The chassis and screen had some scratches. (Expected though since this is a B grade refurbished laptop and doesn't really get in the way.)4 GB of ram isn't enough now a days. (Easily upgradable though so no biggie and the fact the machine is reasonably priced.),Other Thoughts:Went with this as I have a thinkpad for a work laptop that's gone through everything and then some and still works. I've removed the hard drive it came with and replaced it with a SSD I already owned and installed Arch to it. Everything works as designed. This one comes with an Intel graphics chipset so don't expect to play a bunch of games on it. It serves its purpose as something for me to watch movies on and browse the web while traveling.,0,0
Lenovo,t420,4,Best Laptop I've Owned,2016-11-19,"Pros:I spent a lot of time researching the best laptop for me. I run arch linux, so I can make even the worst hardware work, but I wanted something that I could really enjoy using. I wanted a thinkpad because I hear they have the best hardware support for linux, and other than that I just wanted a 2.5 GHz processor with a decent monitor that would last me a few years.With the i5 2520 processor it has been fast enough for everything I use. I run a minimul linux distribution, and for almost every program I run there is no lag. I tried running a heavily modded minecraft client and it ran smoothly with over 150 mods. I added a second 4GB stick of ram and replaced the hard drive with a solid state, an added $40, so I can't comment on the default configuration. But with those installed I can't think of any situation where this computer wouldn't be more than fast enough for personal use.Their is excellent documentation for replacing the hardware. Lenovo provides a free online pdf for anyone interested with a list of compatible parts and all the steps to replacing the hardware components. There are also plenty of online videos. The monitor was damaged when I bought it, and after I recieved the replacement it took me less than 10 minutes to replace it.The laptop also has some neat hardware features, such as an led on top of the monitor for lighting the keyboard since the keyboard does not have a backlight. The keyboard lived up to the hype I read about being excellent. The fn and ctrl key are swapped from the typical layout, but there is a bios option to swap them back in software so it is left to personal preference. The monitor is excellent, and there is very little glare. It has 4 USB ports, a VGA and Display Port, an ethernet port, a CD player, Sim card slot, a hardware WI-FI toggle, and two other card reading components that I cant identify. There is a docking station port on the bottom, but I haven't tested it and it isn't compatible with the larger HP docking stations at my work.The bios is very complete, I played with it once after I first installed my OS, but after that I haven't touched it. If there is a feature you need make sure to check that it is supported, but it probably will be.","Cons:About what you would expect from ""B grade"". There were two damaged components: the monitor had white spots, although they wrere barely noticieable most of the time. Worse, one of the 4 USB Ports was damaged, and the only way I can think to replace it would be to replace the entire motherboard at about $120. The monitor was an easy fix, I bought a replacement for $60 and the whitespots are gone, and it was incredibly easy to replace: just snap of the faceplate, unscrew 4 screws, and remove the tape covering a connector.The battery life is about 3 hours with the monitor on and editing a text file, which isn't too bad but the replacement battery is pretty expensive.The CD-rom supports reading cd's and movies, but it is NOT A CD WRITER. I haven't researched buying a new one, but I wanted to make it clear that you can't save your music to a CD with the hardware setup this comes with.The speakers are average, they don't sound bad but they are pretty quiet. I usually only use headphones or external speakers anyway.","Other Thoughts:This is an excellent laptop, the reason the price is over $500 less than it would be new from lenovo.com is because of damaged hardware and long use. The article I read suggesting I buy a thinkpad also claims businesses buy them from the manufacturer then sell them at a loss after they go out of warranty, which is another factor in the low price. It cost me $180 for the laptop, $40 for better hard drive and ram, $60 for the monitor, totalling $280. I would definitely be willing to spend $350 for what I have after replacing parts, so it is definitely worth the price.",0,0

Lenovo,t420,5,Excellent!,2016-08-22,"Pros:What can I say? This unit is in good condition, with B-Grade as an accurate rating. The reason being -- There are cracks in the palmrest on the left side, and a *very small* visible scuff on the case. None of these impact functionality. If this bothers you, please consider getting one of the other t420 machines for only slightly more money. -- I figured I would give this a chance, since I knew it would get some very heavy use! :)Since I am not going to be using the additional features that Windows 7 Pro has, the Home Premium license that is included is perfectly fine. It's legitimate authorized refurbisher license, and activated without an issue.The screen is in perfect shape -- Very bright at max setting. Exceptional colour. -- I don't mind that it's only 1366x768, but to each his or her own!The unit has a combo microphone / headphone jack, which is mounted in an odd spot, so keep that in mind. Decent low-noise output.The built-in webcam is better than expected. Obviously it's not going to be camcorder quality, but for what it is, it works very well!The Think Light is bright and functional.The battery is far better than expected. -- I can get about an hour out of it. As such, I ordered a brand-new 9-cell.","Cons:- This particular unit does not seem to have a writable optical drive. No issue there -- This is to complement my older refurbished x200s, which has no optical drive at all.- As expected, the built-in microphone is useless. -- Please don't try using it for video chat. -- The official audio driver applies heavy noise reduction to it, resulting in even worse quality than if you just boosted it and dealt with a noisy audio feed! :)","Other Thoughts:Highly recommended. I would order an identical 4GB RAM module, and make sure you put an SSD in it. - I have a 240GB one in mine, since I had it as a spare. Also, you might want to obtain the 9-cell battery.",0,0

HP,640 G1,5,What a great secret deal!,2018-09-19,"Pros:Fast 4th gen M-series laptop and 8GB of memory. A lot of refurbs in this price range have only 4GB memory. This also makes it cheaper to just add another 8GB of matching memory for 16GB instead of throwing away a useless 4GB stick and having to buy a kit of 2x8GB.It has a 9.5mm DVD-RW drive! Yes a lot of us still use DVD-RWs. You can Google HP's GUB0N (with a zero, not the letter ""O"") for full media format support. I have not checked, but I'd guess a 9.5mm tray format HP model UJ262/UJ272 series BD-RE can be swapped and put in there too for playing Blu-Ray movies and using BD-R format media for backups.Windows activation is automatic on first time startup. You just go through some regional and system preference setting options (I disabled all the Win10 spying...errr I mean ""monitoring"" options). Other people have had complaints on booting up HP laptop refurbs with a new Windows install.The best feature of all for those seeing the ""C"" grade rating: mine looks like an A-grade. No scratches and very little keyboard wear. My guess is whoever the user was that owned it connected it to a docking station and kept the lid closed. It really looks brand new. I wish I could post pictures here. I expected a banged up case, scratched LCD, and worn keyboard. Seriously mine looks like just an open box item not a three year old refurbed laptop. I also love the almost leathery cover surface feel. It's hard to describe but feels high quality and no fingerprint grabber like another reviewer mentions.","Cons:Honestly I cannot think of one except that it only came with a 250GB drive. Even for a 2015 era laptop and a business class one, that's small. Now while the HDD is a Seagate Momentus 7200RPM 16MB cache drive (model ST9250410AS), and it is snappier than the usual 5400RPM in this class of drive, keep in mind this model drive has been around since 2009. I have not looked at the build date of my HDD in there. But I plan on upgrading to an SSD anyway, so it doesn't matter.","Other Thoughts:I am completely blown away by the condition of this laptop. It literally looks brand new. Not a scratch on it, especially the screen which is what I was worried about the most. I have not tested battery life yet, but I will. This is a the faster more powerful M-series Intel laptop chip and not the lower powered but slower Intel U-series chip. So keep that in mind. I rarely use my laptops in portable situations so performance is more important than battery life. YMMV.There are literally thousands of refurb laptops available on NewEgg. Do your research on your needs and price them. This is the best deal out there at $178. I cannot believe this score. The condition of it alone, at least the one I got and at least one more reviewer here got, is more like a $225-$250 priced refurb for the specs and A-condition.  I spent weeks looking for the best deal on an A or B refurb, and I rolled the dice on this one knowing it was a C-class referenced one. What a steal!",1,0

It has a high quality finish and the overall build quality is very good. If you upgrade the hard drive to a decent SSD, then the performance of this laptop goes through the roof!","Cons:The mouse track pad is kind of on the small side, but still decent compared to modern laptops, but that is to be expected considering this is far from a new unit. My laptop came with a small fracture on the chassis, but besides being a minor sore for the eyes, it does not detract from the overall experience.","Other Thoughts:The back of the LCD has a really pleasant, rubberized finish.

The only part that is lit up is the power button.-Since there is no back-lit features to the keyboard it is hard to tell whether or not CAPS lock is on unless you start to type.-No num-pad which kind of sucks, but not a big deal i suppose-The keyboard has some flex to it when you type, but not anything too major as long as you don't smash on the keys super hard.-Gets very hot if you want to play games, so I'd advise getting a fan pad to go underneath if you plan on doing so.","Other Thoughts:Overall this is a good laptop for the price if you can get it on sale, but I wouldn't pay full price for it.

ASUS,S510UN-MS52,5,Better than I expected,2018-10-06,"Pros:- 25 Watt MX150 capable of playing Overwatch at 60-70fps in 1080p/Medium Detail- 8th Gen i5 is crazy fast- Weight is very light for 15"" screen- Integrated fingerprint scanner works very well, and although location looks like it would be in the road it's not- Matte Screen with good color and bright enough for indoors, to be certain","Cons:- Power key placement is odd, even though I've not personally had a problem with it- Not a touchscreen :(- Custom power block is stupid design- Warm underneath (especially when playing Overwatch.../taxes the system) - not hot enough to burn, just right at the edge of hot enough to be almost, but not quite uncomfortable.  Of course, the solution to that is to get a separate wireless keyboard + mouse, and connect to flat-screen tv via HDMI...","Other Thoughts:I have a computer engineering degree + >20 years tech experience.  I did a thorough analysis of the market, and ultimately settled on this laptop, because if the mix: i5 8250 + MX150 + 256GB SSD + Matte Screen + extra SSD & SODIMM expansion slots.  NOTE: After I had already bought,  I found out that not all ""MX 150"" graphics chips are equal...apparently there's a 25Watt version, and there's a 10 or 15 Watt version.  Fortunately, this laptop has the 25 Watt version.  More power = more performance.Also, I liked that it had a USB-C port (doesn't do power charging or Thunderbolt)...but at least allows direct use of USB-C peripherals.However, when reading other reviews, I was worried about the screen brightness and/or keyboard.  Both are fine.  I couldn't be happier with the laptop.  There are laptops like Microsoft Surface Laptop that are crazy thin & light (approx. 2-2.5 lbs), but they cost roughly 2x as much as this, or 2.5-3x with MX150-equivalent graphics chip.  This laptop, and a few competitors are in the 3.6-4 lb. range (this being on the light-end of that range).  ACER and some others make bulkier, cheaper items in the 5.5-6lb. range, but to have similar specs to this still cost as much.  All in all, I think this model has the best mix of layout, options, and performance hardware in the price range.  Note: 3.6-4 lbs sounds heavy, but it actually doesn't FEEL heavy in hand.  And, compared to a 5.5-6lb. older laptop I have, when I held both, this felt amazingly light...enough to matter.I highly recommend if you're considering this, or others in the same price range, just get this.",7,1

At it's highest setting it's still too weak to hear without strain on some sites. Often I have to hdmi it into a monitor to get adequate volume.It seems to me that these two issues should be easily correctable by Asus. There's no reasonable excuse for lapses in quality like these. Thus 3 stars",Other Thoughts:I'm still undecided as to whether or not to return this unit. If it wasn't such a hassle I'd have sent it back already.

My first client has nothing but good to say about the PC and I spent enough time with both to give my own opinion as well.- The G50-70's aesthetics are really sleek. It has a beaded top panel and a brushed-aluminum look on the inside. It's relatively light, and rather thin--if not comparing to Ultrabooks. Overall, it's a really nice looking laptop.- The keyboard feel and layout is preferable. The only part of the keyboard that I dislike is the enter key; otherwise, Lenovo doesn't commit any cardinal sins some manufacturers do with keyboard layout. The keys are also responsive, smooth, and have a slight curve to the bottom, which at first I didn't like and thought strange, but you get used to them quickly and in the end are not a con but a pro. The touchpad is also nice, smooth and has two dedicated, thin left and right click buttons, which I prefer.- I immediately upgraded this Lenovo to Windows 10 and, in both instances, it upgraded without a hitch. The touchpad was unaffected by driver issues, and Lenovo has relatively all proper Windows 10 drivers available for download off their website. All the drivers and integrated hardware worked without a hitch.","Cons:- The screen bezel is a little thicker than it should be. Nowadays bezels are shrinking more and more, mostly on IPS panels which this is obviously not, but the G50's aesthetics are slightly hurt by the thick bezels. Speaking of the screen; though not terrible, it's viewing angles suffer from quick color drain and fade. Again, though, on a budget PC like this, expecting an IPS or great screen is reasonableness.- Lenovo includes some Bloatware, like all manufacturers, so if you'd like you can uninstall them. However, the Bloatware isn't nearly as bad as some other manufacturers with their third-party apps.- There are some PCs in the same price range that have slightly better specs like an i5 or higher storage space or even 8GB RAM.",Other Thoughts:- In conclusion: The Lenovo G50-70 is a respectable bang-for-the-buck PC; good for college or school students or home users that don't want to spend too much but want a PC with enough chops to do most any basic/mediate tasks-except for gaming or workstation apps.,1,0
Lenovo,G50-70 (59421807),5,Awesome basic laptop,2015-06-06,Pros:Great specs for the priceLong battery life for basic tasks,Cons:The left mouse button wore out quckly. It still works but is a definite difference from the less-used right button.,Other Thoughts:I really question how they fit so much laptop into this price range. The HDD is quite slow (like most) so I would recommend picking up an SSD if this will be your daily driver.,1,0
Lenovo,G50-70 (59421807),5,NOTHING BETTER IN THE PRICE RANGE,2015-05-24,"Pros:For the price, nothing compares. Great looking design, very sleek. With new HDD and RAM this machine screams, more on this later. Very good screen for a laptop, good contrast and low glare even from weird angles, which is where most laptops don't compare. Stays pretty cool even when playing games for hours.","Cons:All the left side ports (USB 3.0, USB 2.0, HDMI, Ethernet, VGA ports are pretty crammed together, making it hard to occupy many ports simultaneously, especially the 2 USB ports, luckily there is a third USB 2.0 on the right side.Battery life is nothing to brag about, but it's only 4 cell so  kinda knew that going in.","Other Thoughts:I bought the barebones version of this in hopes to upgrade the HDD, the RAM, and the processor with laptop parts I was able to get my hands on.The HDD and RAM were a breeze, I bought an WD BLACK2 Dual Drive (which I highly highly recommend) and upgraded it to 8GB of RAM as well as a clean installation of windows 8.1 to make this thing screaming fast, the only problem was the processor, after opening the laptop and voiding the warranty, I found the proc to be built into the motherboard and NOT up-gradable at all. this was odd to me, as all my other laptops had removable processors. just an FYI if you are thinking of upgrading. But i got over this, and am sticking with the i3, the other upgrades make this thing still so fast. I love this little machine now.The last thing is the keyboard may be something to get used to. I bought this for my girlfriend who is used to Acer laptops and it took her a few days or more to get used to the layout of the keyboard.Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants a budget laptop (Not for the avid gamer obviously.) WIth the small and inexpensive upgrades, this thing could easily be worth $700+",2,0
Lenovo,G50-70 (59421807),5,"Great, Inexpensive Laptop",2015-04-13,"Pros:Light, quick, everyday laptop.  Handles normal tasks like web browsing and video or music playback with no issues.  6GB vs 4GB for RAM keeps windows from bogging down.","Cons:None that I can think of.  500GB hard drive is small, but for less than $375, totally expected.  Manage your expectations - this is not a gaming laptop.","Other Thoughts:I am deployed to the desert and my laptop met a violent end.  I got this one, oriignally as a temporary replacement.  I would just get something ""better"" when I got home and give it to my mom or something.  After using it for a few weeks, I think I'll keep it for myself.  It does everything I need without a hiccup.  Great little (specs not size) machine that doesn't miss a beat.  Props to Newegg for being one of the few companies that ship computers to APO addresses.  Mine got here 9 days after ordering - Outstanding!",4,0
Lenovo,G50-70 (59421807),5,Excellent Budget Work Laptop,2015-04-09,"Pros:I purchased this laptop to serve as a general use work laptop. I am NOT gaming on it. I have installed my own operating system as well. I am using the laptop for network scanning, programming, general office work, email, skype, and web browsing.For my uses, this laptop is perfect. It has everything you could need for most computer work. I had it all configured and running exactly how I wanted with all updates installed within a couple hours. It runs smoothly and the extra ram allows for plenty of multi tasking.Also, experience the wonder that is the Novo Button. I had never heard about it before. You press it when the computer is off and it boots straight to Bios. So nice.","Cons:Note I have had this laptop for 1 day so I cannot comment on its longevity. Although, looking at my friend's ancient and somewhat damaged Lenovo he still uses constantly, I have high hopes.The battery life is a bit short. You can squeeze out 3 hours at most. Certainly not the worst though, average laptop battery life of a laptop is 3-5 hours.Installing a separate operating system was a bit annoying due to UEFI, but that is not really the fault of the computer itself. If you're interested, you just need to switch over to legacy booting in the Bios, but make sure you switch it back when you want to boot Windows 8 or you'll get scary errors. The Novo Button makes getting to Bios and doing this a breeze.",Other Thoughts:To answer questions that show up in the Q&A a lot:This is NOT a touch screen.This does NOT have a backlit keyboard.This DOES have a number pad.This does NOT include a Windows Recovery Disc.,4,0
Lenovo,G50-70 (59421807),5,Nice bang for the buck,2015-02-19,Pros:Met exceptions with zippy enough mid-range performance @< $400.Decent graphics quality.Nice looking.  It looks and almost feels metallic.Easy access to internal parts for performing a drive swap.,Cons:Re-installed 8.1 to purge the bloatware and install a SSD but the drivers were easy to find so it all went smoothly.The trackpad is kind of annoying but I expected this after reading the reviews on the Lenovo site.,Other Thoughts:The relatively new Windows 8.1 Media Creation Tool makes rebuilding OEM machines like this fairly easy. Make sure you create the USB with FAT32 for UEFI support.The previous reviewer buys a Win 8.1 PC and proceeds to complain about it? SMH with bemusement.,4,1
Lenovo,G50-70 (59421807),3,Lenovo G50,2014-10-26,Pros:It is small handy real computer,Cons:I hate Windows 8 and the computer is burdened with it also.,Other Thoughts:turning off the touch pad was a major pain.  I'm using a wireless track ball,0,15
