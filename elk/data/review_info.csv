AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Fantastic package,2019-02-20,"Pros:This CPU is a powerhouse. Paired with my Crosshair VII Hero motherboard, overclocking it to get the most out of the cores and the RAM, alongside a RTX 2080 has me running all current triple-A games well beyond 60FPS at maximum settings.Installation was a breeze. Chip slid right in and the heatsink/fan that came with it snapped right on to the motherboard's mounts with zero issues.The LEDS are beautiful and absolutely mesmerizing to watch.","Cons:The fan is VERY loud when under loads. It's not a consistent noise, but it will do a sporadic burst of high RPM that hits nearly 56dba to quickly cool down the processor, then it quiets down for a few minutes thereafter.","Other Thoughts:I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking to get a great CPU for their money. Keep in mind, if you don't like a noisy cooling system, you might want to look into a different one than the one that comes with the CPU."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Smoking fast,2019-02-19,Pros:It does everything but drive me to work !,Cons:No pretty stickers to put on the side of my case.,Other Thoughts:Yes Yes Yes Get this CPU you won't be disappointed.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great piece of hardware,2019-02-18,Pros:Runs very well for gaming and multitasking.,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:I would absolutely recommend and have this item.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Product! Easy to Setup and Use!,2019-02-18,Pros:what you liked about the product: everythingmy job (taking over the world) was definitely made easier by the product!not there yet but almost lol,Cons:- What did you not like about the product?liked everything!How could it be improved?i dunno! f f s ! i dont work in the computer hardware industry lol- Let others know if any of the problems you encountered can be resolved or avoided.no problems thus far so stop bringing that sh 1 T  up!- Be sure to include any bugs or defects.Again none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great for gaming,2019-02-17,Pros:i got mine to OC at 4.1GHZ at 1.35V stable,Cons:none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Would have worked great.,2019-02-16,Pros:It's fast,Cons:The pins are fragile. Wish they'd stop using pins,"Other Thoughts:I know this is a great CPU, I know it would have done everything I asked of it. I know that it, in many ways is superior to Intel. I just wish they didn't use pins. Accidents do happen, pins do get bent, and when they do, AMD doesn't do anything to help you..You'd think they'd plan ahead for accidents to happen knowing that they use pins instead of pads. That people aren't perfect. Instead, they'd rather leave you hanging with a $300 gold plated paperweight that you spent months saving up for, and that is so heartbreaking...This new build was suppose to be a chance to make some money from home ""I'm disabled"" and now I can't...So yea, I only docked the one point because of the pins and how unwilling AMD is to help you if you have any kind of accident...If I ever get a chance to buy a new one ""Which will take who knows how long"" I'll update this review."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great processor hard to overclock,2019-02-14,Pros:Been using this for several months now and I have to say it is a fast processor.One thing to keep in mind is that its internal built features it keeps track of how hot it is and will downclock itself if it gets to hot. I've noticed the better the cooling the more it overclocks itself and keeps the overclock (yes it does this on its own and does not need anyone to tweek the settings).,Cons:If you try and manually overclock it you may have issues trying to get it stable. It is really not needed. You should focus more on keeping it as cool as you can so it can overclock itself.,Other Thoughts:None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Big power savings,2019-02-11,"Pros:Despite the fact that it's listed at 105W, this saves a lot of power over an FX 8350 both at idle and at max throughput. I assume that's because it calculates & completes OS requests so much faster, therefore obviating the need to keep it running at higher wattage for longer periods of time. I discovered this pleasant surprise by monitoring a UPS regularly for the first few weeks.","Cons:It is often said that AMD does not support using the 2700x on Windows 7, when in fact they leave that up to the motherboard manufacturers and Microsoft. If it doesn't work on Windows 7, the motherboard makers and Microsoft will just point fingers at each other.",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Processor,2019-02-11,Pros:- Price is very good- Runs great- AMD Wraith Prism Cooler is wonderful and not very loud- Upgraded my computer with this and it is doing a wonderful job and stays a lot cooler than my older processor,Cons:None that I can think of,Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this product!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Works almost perfectly... Almost a full RG(B) cooler.,2019-02-10,Pros:The CPU was able to hold an overclock of 17% and remain fairly cool in the process. Flawlessly installed and easyA Value for sure and worth buying.,Cons:Well.... Here is the almost. The Wraith cooler that is on the CPU is beautiful if it wasn't for the BLUE LED not working. This absolutely sucks.I would think that the tech would have spotted this in the testing before shipping but they didn't. The CPU has won the silicone lottery but the LED Wraith Cooler is a huge disappointment.,Other Thoughts:I would recomend this CPU but would be really careful if you are needing the RGB lighting for a special build as you might run into problems with it being able to produce the effect that is necessary for your install.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great CPU,2019-02-10,Pros:I waited a month before writing my reviews on the build I put together with boxing day sales. I picked up this CPU on sale and so far I can say that I have no complaints. The cooler that it came with was effective enough to keep the temperatures nice and stable (around 68 deg C).My only recommendation is to get some good after market thermal paste for the CPU. The stuff that is pre-applied will probably be ok but I wouldnt risk it personally.,"Cons:No cons yet, if anything changes, I will update","Other Thoughts:Just for reference, my build is: Ryzen 7 2700, 16GB G.Skill Trident 3200, ASUS Prime X-470 Pro mother board, MSI RX Vega 64 Airboost. I also have two Corsair 140mm magnetic fans for intake cooling set up with positive pressure. The case is a Carbide 270R (which is a great budget case if you are building a decent computer and want good cooling with lots of room)"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Glad I switched back to AMD,2019-02-08,Pros:- 8c/16t monster of a chip for half the price of the 9900k.,Cons:- None so far.,"Other Thoughts:Sure the 9900k beats Ryzen when trying to squeeze out every possible frame, but not enough to justifying spending double in my opinion. You can buy this chip, a decent b450/x470 board and ram for around the same price as the 9900k alone, which is insane. Can't wait for Ryzen 2."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Works great,2019-02-07,"Pros:Chip works amazing in my gf's new computer, she runs every game on ultra, along with a good GPU, and ram, definitely recommend it, and considerably cheaper than getting an i-7 or i-9",Cons:havent found any,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Very Happy,2019-02-06,"Pros:- self OC is deadly, runs high 4.2 regularily.","Cons:- devours the memory, i run B450F 3333 with 16GB Vengence LPX 3333 and im only hitting like 78th percentile for memory on passmark because of it.",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Um, yeah. This thing is fantstic!",2019-02-01,"Pros:Got the Chip for just under 300.00 and for the price it is a great value.Only do 1080P gaming, and paired it with a Vega 64, and has been a great comboGreat in Blender and anything else I throw at it.",Cons:Really can't think of any,"Other Thoughts:Chip like to stay cool to get most of XFR. Under custom whole house water loop, I can get 4.4ghz benchable and 4.3 stable on all cores. Under full load, chip stays under 45*C. Without the custom loop, 4.3 was hard to achieve.Not sure why some are saying the performance was killed with AGESA updates. Haven't noticed this, but also on 1.0.0.6"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Great Cpu, Easy overclocking",2019-01-31,"Pros:I was able to manage a stable over clock of 4.2 on the factory cooler that comes with this cpu, Through bios. I was extremely surprised, Handles gaming like a breeze at ultra settings if paired with a proper graphics card.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Finally a good rival for Intel,2019-01-31,Pros:- Pretty much an overkill for any specs for further games to come- Amazing driver (AMD Ryzen Master)- It will boost to 4.3 ghz with the default setting (it will fluctuate from 2.4 ghz to 4.3 ghz on heavy load)- I manually set it to stay at 4.1ghz and go to 4.3ghz-ish on heavy load- Doesn't bottleneck with my RTX 2080,"Cons:- Took a long time to ship, it comes from the US so expect a long shipping time (roughly two weeks)- Nothing else","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, I always been a fan boy of AMD cpu but the last time I had to build myself a pc, AMD wasn't doing cpus anymore so I had to go with Intel. I'm SO glad to be back with AMD !"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Good CPU,2019-01-30,Pros:Not easily overloaded. most of the time works with minimal efforts for middle range tasks.,Cons:System not noticeably faster than AM3+Too costly as an overall build versus benefits (If upgrading from AM3),"Other Thoughts:AMD could include a taller heat sink and quiet fan, we'll pay for it. The included sink and its fan are j a joke."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Runs great on Linux,2019-01-29,"Pros:I compile like no other. Great for dev, gaming and other computing hobbies. It runs beautifully on Linux.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Very solid indeed.,2019-01-29,"Pros:-I've been running this for 8 months and have had 0 problems.-The included wraith spire fan is awesome, even though im using an AIO water cooler.-I'm overclocking over the max boost limit with 0 issues and cool temps.",Cons:-none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing all the way HELLS TO THE YES!!,2019-01-23,Pros:Everything about my build using this processor was pretty much flawless!!,Cons:none!,Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this processor to everyone who wants to build a bad @ $ $ box!!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,NOW I'M PLAYING WITH POWER!!!,2019-01-22,Pros:This processor is out of sight! It was easy to install and the WRAITH cooler it comes with really does the job! Stressing it for over 15 minutes and it still stayed at no higher than 80 degress C. This is a great alternative to the rising prices of the Intel chips. Try this and you won't be disappointed. The WRAITH  cooler has RGB and it is addressable but you have to download the softwarefrom AMD's website in order to change the colors on it. And you also have to use the USB cable that comes with it and plug it into a RGB  header on the motherboard also.,Cons:None.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2019-01-21,Pros:the delivry was very fast and the cpu work perfectly fine. The fan that come up with the cpu its pretty amazing as well,Cons:did have any problem.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,good processor,2019-01-20,Pros:just got it and hooked it up in my new PC build runs AC odyssey on full blast with no issues-the prism cooler is having no trouble keeping it cool did ben mark on cineabench with no overclocking and temps got no higher than 67c-adjusting the RGB was a sinch with the coolmaster paneli-,Cons:for the free game they want you to subscribe to there newsletter no big deal until they want you to download a program to verify the processor and I got a error the said pct wasn't genuine maybe cause I need a windows key but still if they want a verification they could ask for the recipe from new egg or something instead of downloading a program that most ppl will unistall after they got the game waiting till I get the cash to activate windows if I still have trouble looks like ill be calling them ...,Other Thoughts:will recommend and keep buying from AMD its cheaper than intel and be honest with gaming ppl not rly going to notice any difference wife got a i7 and I rly dont see anything different at least with the games now days
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,great cpu for professional workloads,2019-01-13,"Pros:Great for video editing, great for streaming, okay for gaming, overclock okayish on the stock cooler but better to leave it at stock settings instead, lots of cores and threads","Cons:Stock cooler can get loud, isn't best performer for gaming.",Other Thoughts:If you are just gaming get the ryzen 5 2600x or ryzen 5 2600 with an aftermarket cooler and it will be better than this cpu. Other than that this cpu is a beast!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,works great!,2019-01-12,Pros:a lot more performance than my old ryzen 3 2200g,Cons:canot overclock like intel at 5 ghz,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2019-01-12,Pros:Fast and perfect,Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome Awesome sauce!  Best value for overall performance.  They are pushing Intel aside.,2019-01-11,Pros:Super fast for multitasking.  I run virtual machines all day long for work and then game sometimes in the evenings and this thing does it all.  I don't even need to close any VMs to load a game.  I also can stream 4k on one monitor and game on the other with a VM loaded on the 3rd.  Get full 75FPS (freezync) on the game monitor with no frame drop.*****---Buy this now and sell it on *online_marketplace* when the Ryzen 3000 (16 core 5GHz) comes out in ~6 months.,Cons:Get DDR4 3000 RAM that is approved for your x470 motherboard.  It can be hard to tweak RAM perfectly for this CPU and base 2100MHz will starve this CPU.  Don't overclock the cores at all.  Just get RAM that will run at least 3000 and you are golden.,Other Thoughts:Includes cooler!Great on ~$120 x470 motherboardsGet AMD approved DDR4 3000+ RAM and make sure to set it right in BIOS.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Computer turned on the first time!!!,2019-01-06,"Pros:I can write code, watch Netflix, listen to Pandora, track the stock market, and play a game or two all at the same time.",Cons:Runs a bit hotter than I like with Noctua NH-D15 SE-AM4.Limited clock speed.,"Other Thoughts:Will be upgrading to 3700X, AM4 socket FTW."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Wish I could rate 4.5/5,2019-01-05,"Pros:The cpu is priced right and the cooler makes a great gift to a friend if you plan to go aftermarket, I gave it to my friend with a 2600 build.  With my Cooler Master AIO liquid cooler I'm able to get the cpu to 4.3 GHz on all cores and have zero stability issues.  Temps max out at about 73C so still plenty of headroom for cooling even when under 100% utilization.  Able to stream while gaming and will be doing some video editing as well.","Cons:I currently have an Rx 580 and upgraded to a RTX 2070, but my performance didn't increase all that much in PUBG, maybe only 10fps, this may be because the CPU was bottlenecked even at 4.3ghz the IPC is still not as good as a 8700k from Intel at 5ghz.  I wish I could overclock this thing higher to get that performance, so I returned my 2070 :( I guess you can say this cpu saved me 800 bucks? Or maybe it was my guilt for spending 800 dollars on a GPU.","Other Thoughts:Can't wait to see where Zen 2 goes, AMD is on the right track to keep competition in the PC component marketplace."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Gets the job done,2019-01-04,Pros:It doesn't have a problem with anything I throw at it.,Cons:It runs warm even with a 240mm liquid cooler.,Other Thoughts:I tried overcooking this processor and only have success to 4.1 GHz. Heat doesn't seem to be the issue at all as it stays under 65C overcooked to 4.1 GHz anything above that and I experience stability issues.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Budget Beast,2018-12-31,Pros:Does everything it claimsEasy set upComes with cooler if you don't want to spend any extra cash,Cons:Nothing of the top of my mind.,"Other Thoughts:Runs great, affordable, easy to use. I swapped out the cooler they included (which is not a bad cooler by any means) for liquid cooling, but love it so far."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,slightly deceptive,2018-12-31,Pros:I literally just received the package. haven't tried it out yet.,"Cons:the box was kind of crushed. the CPU box was fine and upon further inspection everything inside was undamaged.However, printed on the side of the box, and the front, it says that contained in this box is a AMD processor, AMD thermal solution, installation instructions, and warranty info.now I may be thinking that thermal solution is referring to the mall paste but I think they mean the fan and heatsink. But, there are no installation instructions at all.",Other Thoughts:missing the instructions isn't a downside for me. I've been building computers for a while so I don't really need them.I just thought I'd share that.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best Value processor for gaming,2018-12-29,Pros:Runs everything wellCan also stream at decent setting while playing,Cons:None so far,"Other Thoughts:I put this in with a thermaltake aio cooler and haven't seen it go above 55 celsius even after long gaming sessions. Great power, great price (I paid around $260 on BF), and runs flawlessly"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,The all rounder CPU,2018-12-28,"Pros:Fast, Affordable.",Cons:none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Fine, so far",2018-12-25,Pros:Just one thing if you are here for multitasking... Trust me you are definitely in the right place (perfect for gaming also),"Cons:The shipment toke 10 days in the airport stucked because newegg didn't send the clearance fast, it should of arrived earlier hy more than 10 days",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Decent Processor,2018-12-24,"Pros:Great upgrade from my FX8350, paired with an Asrock X470 Taichi and 16GB of GSkill Trident 3200 MHz Memory.  Much faster than my previous system, glad I waited for the Ryzen 2000 series before upgrading.","Cons:The Ryzen 7 CPU's, the 2700X specifically uses a +10 degree temperature offset to maintain fan consistency.  I've noticed with my setup that due this +10 degree temperature offset, that my system doesn't boost as high as it can.",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,good processor,2018-12-20,Pros:8 cores 16 threads for less then 500 bucks. solid performance all around good buy. the motherboards are pretty cheap compared to the blue team.,Cons:needs expensive ram to gain performance. Its ok at overclocking but oc the ram brings better performance.,Other Thoughts:havnt had a problem out of the chip like at all. no patches have slowed down performance like intel has. bc of the core count and performance will be a good chip for yrs to come.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-12-19,Pros:Works,Cons:No cons,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,great cpu and great price,2018-12-19,Pros:fast cpu with a rgb cooler,"Cons:some bug for using old version win 10, must download the newest windows if use this cpu",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing performance!,2018-12-18,"Pros:- Performance is really satisfying!- Temperature is not bad with stock wraith cooler, 40 degrees at idle and around 60 under very heavy load- Wraith cooler is really shiny!- Really good deal, I got it for only 330 CAD during Black Friday.",Cons:None really so far!,"Other Thoughts:The PGA type CPU is still very hard to work with. Extremely easy to pull the entire CPU out when uninstalling the cooler, and if you happen to drop the CPU on the floor, you are pretty much in big trouble. Hope AMD can switch to LGA soon."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Faster Than My AMD FX 9590.,2018-12-18,Pros:Love this Processor 40% Improvement over my AMD FX 9590 Rig.Runs Cool with the EVGA 280 Closed Loop Water Cooler.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Will be Purchasing more of these in the Future for my other PC Upgrades.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fantastic,2018-12-15,"Pros:We all know the Ryzen 7 is awesome, but I didn't expect the included cooler (Wraith Prism) to be good enough for my purposes. It very much is. The thing takes everything I can throw at it from Prime95 without breaking 75C.",Cons:None!,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Super fast and a bargain for the price.,2018-12-15,Pros:Fast CPU and comes with a stock cooler saving the additional purchase.  Acquired it as a Combo with the ASRock x470 Mobo. Both are terrific and easy to install.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Highly recommend.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,excellent,2018-12-13,Pros:Fast;Does everything I want;,Cons:Noisy stock cooler,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Bang for the buck can't beat it.,2018-12-12,Pros:Had the 8350 was time to upgrade. There is a big difference in performance between them. I kept my same video card and I'm not getting screen tearing and artifacts now.,Cons:None that I can think of everything was straight forward on installation.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing,2018-12-11,Pros:- multithreaded applications are amazing- gaming is amazing- absolutely fantastic cooler- runs cool 26 on idle and 56 in gaming and around 60 on a heavy work load.,Cons:I can't think of any to be honest.,Other Thoughts:This processor does not need to be overclocked it's not an Intel processor. If you have good cooling it will boost itself. My processor sits itself at 4.2ghz boost without me doing anything. Pair it up with 3000mhz of higher ram and it's an absolute monster of a processor. Why spend more on an Intel processor that you have to overclock or buy an aftermarket cooler for?I had the i7 7700k prior to this processor and I see a huge difference in performance between the two processors in both gaming and work applications.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"love it, Extremely fast.",2018-12-11,"Pros:Extremely fast with multiple threads and cores, good stock cooler, perfect for multithreaded workloads, works pretty decent for gaming.",Cons:Single core performance is a little lacking compared to Intel,Other Thoughts:I was able to overclock this baby to 4.2ghz at 1.3345v to the core. The cpu cooler gets a bit loud when you do this but it keeps it cool. The max temperature I got on my cpu so far with the overclock is 76*c
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent processeur,2018-12-09,"Pros:- Fonctionne super bien avec le radiateur fournit, fonctionne entre 4 et 4,1 ghz en permanence. il est seulement à 34 degrés Celsius (environ 12 au dessus de la température pièce) il monte à 65 degrés Celsius lors d'un test cinebench, dans cinebench j'ai fait un score de 1745 cu (sans l'avoir overclocker).","Cons:Pour le moment, rien.","Other Thoughts:Je recommande ce processeur, il est parfait. Je compte garder mon ordinateur pendant plusieurs années, c'est pour ça que j'ai acheter un processeur aussi cher."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Performs well as expected,2018-12-09,"Pros:I haven't done a lot of testing, but there are several other reviews out there already.I have the CPU running at stock settings. Speed boosts to 4.3 GHz when gaming, 4.1 Ghz running Prime95. CPU temp maxes out around 75 C with the included cooler.The Wraith Prism RGB lighting effects are cool...",Cons:The instructions are minimal. I had to search online what the included cables are for and what software is needed to control the RGB lighting on the cooler.,Other Thoughts:Bought it on sale during Cyber Monday. Definitely worth the price considering it has 8 cores.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing! Blazing Fast!,2018-12-09,Pros:Excellent product. It exceeded my expectations in performanceLove the RGB cooler fan!Runs cool when not overclockedGreat bang for your $$,Cons:None that I noticed,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,1,over heats easy,2018-12-07,Pros:- 8 cores- fast,Cons:- doesn't ram well enough- get hot very easy- the stock fan is trash,"Other Thoughts:This will be my last amd build after see how badly this worked with my 3,200 32gb gskill ram.  I'm building Intel next and I've been an AMD user my entire LIFE!!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD 2700X is a beast!!!,2018-12-04,Pros:8 cores.. 16 threads,Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:So i purchased this CPU last week.. I'm using it for both gaming and design..I didn't overclock it or anything and its running at 4.1ghz on my Asus mobo ( B450-F gaming)I use 2D and 3D design softwares and playing games such as BTF5, Assassins creed odyssey, GTAV etc.This CPU with my 1080 graphics card and 16gb 3200hz of memory run everything without any problem..Amazing performance and great price as always from AMD..I definitely recommend this cpu"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,1790-1815 Cinebench with stock cooler.,2018-12-04,"Pros:Incredible value propositionStock Cooler works well enough, little tricky to install (try unscrewing the retention bars on the motherboard if you can't get it on)Much improved Memory Stability.","Cons:CCX Interconnect latency. But we all better get used to it, chiplets are the future of processors.Voltages can reach 1.5v on the core during peak XFR. It's scary, and even though AMD Engineers say it's perfectly fine, it will never stop bugging you for some reason. (All core 4.0GHZ runs at a much more palatable 1.35V)Some Errata still exist, because Zen is a new architecture. Make sure your copy of Windows is up to date before installing a Zen CPU (Ideally create a new ISO with microsoft's helpful utility)","Other Thoughts:Not much to say, it's a CPU, it handles pretty much everything you throw at it.Yeah, it's not as fast as Intel's top shelf desktop stuff. Intel earned their place at the top through fair and foul means like any good corporation, so if the extra 5-20% performance is worth it to you (Depending on workload) by all means, go for it. Competitive gamers, and people who do render workloads that can leverage the IGPU especially would benefit more from Intel's CPUs, everyone else, wouldn't be able to tell the difference."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-12-03,Pros:Delivered quickly and for a reasonable price,Cons:We bought the wrong one,Other Thoughts:We heard this processor is bbn one of the best unfortunately we didn't check our socket type 1st and it didn't fit
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome,2018-12-02,"Pros:You get what everyone is raving about, really nice cooler.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Highly recommend.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Almost replaced an AMD FX with an i7-8700k, went with this at the last moment. No regrets!",2018-11-27,"Pros:- Has as many threads as my computer has gigabytes of RAM.- Great for workbench loads- Great for gaming loads- Great for Tornado Trouble- Comes with the Wraith Prism cooler, fully equipped with LED lighting and is the best stock cooler you will ever own (maybe even the best air cooler in general) [I actually switch from water back to air because of this cooler]- Much more power efficient than my old Piledriver CPU.",Cons:- CPU itself is not RGB,"Other Thoughts:As my title says, I used to own an FX-8320 that I somehow managed to overclock to almost 5 GHz on a 150 watt motherboard for 4 years. Don't ask how. I don't know. It just worked. My power supply's digital link says that the CPU was drawing almost 250 watts at times. Anyways, the FX-8320 was becoming slower and slower compared to the market, and the power consumption for such a slow CPU was absurd. I looked into upgrades and had planned an Intel i7-8700k build to replace my obsolete FX. Just before ordering, I stumbled upon this here Ryzen 7 2700X, and I'm glad I did.The Intel i7-8700k is only slightly faster in single- and quad-core programs. The Ryzen, however, is a multitasking behemoth that performs much better when utilizing its full power. Most games that I play are capable of multithreading to this level anyways. Some may debate me on which CPU is really the best, but my vote goes for this one. Great purchase!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Working Really Good, My First Team Red Experience",2018-11-27,"Pros:- Benchmarks real nice (compared to my old 4770K, you'd hope it was better right? 8] )- Running all my games, servers, etc real good- Made my storage system function better with the added PCI Lanes n'at- The cooler that comes with it is really cool, works well","Cons:- I have not found any really, if your my friends, ""it isn't from Team Blue, so it's no good"" LOL!",Other Thoughts:- It does run pretty hot underload but it never goes anywhere near too hot.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,In my Helios 500,2018-11-26,"Pros:Runs cool as a cucumber. Pushed it to 4.075GHZ whilst staying under 88 degrees. Most of the time it's at 4.0 GHZ and below 80 degrees.Builds code, machine learning models, games, audio/video/graphics.Truly a powerhouse!!!Great work AMD!",Cons:ABSOLUTELY NONE!,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Decent Upgrade,2018-11-22,Pros:- Tons of cores/threads- Semi decent stock clock speeds- Older am4 motherboard compatibility,Cons:- Intel is still a bit better for gaming because of single core performance-Don't expect turbo boost to go above 4.0GHz on stock clocks,"Other Thoughts:I originally bought a ryzen 1600, but then I bought a gtx 1080. I wanted to upgrade, but didn't feel like getting a whole new motherboard for an intel. This upgrade definitely helped my frames in demanding games. Video rendering and general tasks are noticeably snappier now. The upgrade was easier than expected. Just make sure you have the latest bios if you have an older am4 mobo. Put a H55 AIO cooler on it and never go above  60C. Future proof enough that some day I may overclock a tad."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,2700x is power,2018-11-21,"Pros:I've been with Intel for the last 10 years, and I wanted to try something different for a change, and for the price, I wanted to put the 2700x in the mix, paired with a Crosshair VI Extreme.  So far, the chip is incredible with multitasking and the entire Windows experience is smoother than my older 6700k.  I will admit, having 20-25 tabs open most of the time, VMs, and typical programming stuff ... the 2700x far outperforms the 6700k in multitasking no doubt.  All cores are used in Windows, which surprised me, and the rendering speed was well worth it when tested.  By the way, the Aura looks great!","Cons:I have G.Skill F4 3200C16D-GTZ memory, and it won't run 3200, need to keep it at 2933 (might be other timings).the 2700x runs hot, often hitting over 80 degrees celcius with the included stock cooler, which does get loud and keeps the clock rates lower, 3.9 with all cores 100% (but still above the rated 3.7) ... and truly uses all its 105 watts to power itself which surprised me more often than anticipated.  Gaming frame rates are lower than Intels, even my 6700k with many games, but, the experience has been smoother ... no more hiccups with cpu and drives.  Honestly, for $60 more, I should have bought the 8700k this summer when it was cheaper $449 for the 8700k, where I bought the 2700x for $429.","Other Thoughts:Going to put a AIO water cooling unit on it, see if the game changes.  I know that Ryzen likes 3466 memory, so, that too, might be the next purchase.  All this paired with 980 Pro 512GB for speed!BUT, for price ... the 2700x is by far, the best choice out there!  And I wanted something more for work, than play this time.  And it has not disappointed."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,I've never owned an Intel chip,2018-11-21,"Pros:- Fast, reliable and priced low- I've gotten all cores OC'd to 4.2 stable.  4.3 BSODs on Cinebench- Easy installation- Near instant boots with NVMe drive for OS.",Cons:- I'd like to see the thermals come down a bit.  I have a Dark Rock Pro 4 sitting on top of this thing with GC Extreme thermal paste and I am still getting high 30's low 40s idle.,Other Thoughts:- would recommend since team blue always tacks on like 200 to 300 bucks for equiv CPUs- I have done nothing that choked out this CPU.

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent Choice For The Budget Conscious,2018-11-18,Pros:-Lower price point makes it a good alternative for the budding pc builder/upgrader-Decent air cooler with fancy RGB color thingies-Good performance for the price value,"Cons:-Fans can get a bit loud (and CPU a bit warmer) during heavy usage-With that being said, you may want to reconsider an improved CPU cooler in later upgrades down the road","Other Thoughts:Old rig is 7 years old (i7 2700k) and showing it's age. I figured it's time for a new build. Since I game/draw/animate and stream and budget is an issue, I have to find that happy medium where it can do my current PC needs without breaking the bank.Originally was going for the i7 8700k since my old 2700k has served me well but the price point and my current financial situation forced me to look for alternatives which is the Ryzen series chips and I liked what I saw: it's ability to multi task with it's 8 physical cores/12 threads for various applications for it's price point and I figured I can use the extra money saved to invest in a GPU (RTX 2070) instead. The air cooler that comes with it is a nice enough entry level CPU air cooler instead of spending that saved extra money (which again, I spent it on the GPU instead) for an aftermarket CPU cooler.Sure, as far as performance goes compared to the i7 8700k option, this chip is just a tad bit behind in some aspects and then again, it excel in some areas. I knew what I will be getting with the Ryzen option and I'm totally fine with it.All in all, I was able to find that nice compromise between affordability, future proofing and it's enhanced ability to multi task. So for a budget gamer/artist/budding streamer like me, it's fills that quota quite fine.New rig is as follows:AMD 2700x CPU w/Wraith Spire CPU CoolerCorsair Vengeance RGB 16GB 3200MHzASUS RTX 2070 8GBx1TB Samsung EVO SSDx2 500GB M.2 SATA/NVME SSDx1 2TB HDD (from the old rig)EVGA G+ 750WCorsair 275R case"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,A beast of a processor.,2018-11-17,"Pros:Handles multi-threaded performance unlike any processor I've had, I decided to give my mother my 1700X as she was still using a i7 970. Now she has performance as well. I paired this was an ASRock Taichi Ultimate, and a 500gb m.2 with 16GB of Corsair Vengance Pro 3200. I put both my NVidia 1060ti's back in, and installed CentOS Linux as my host OS, and installed my Virtual Machines to a 1TB SSD the performance of this is unbelievable and I added an addition 16gb of memory in and boosted my VM's I run a dual 43"" Samsung 4k HDR Pro TVs as monitors.I am able to re-compress video files, run a game in ultra settings, and my CPU temps don't get over 52C, I have the Corsair H150i installed into a NXZT 440.",Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:Aside from the threadripper, this CPU will handle all the tasks you need. Also you can run linux without an issues, I made a clean install of CentOS with KDE Plasma, no issues. I have 4 task windows so I put my Windows VM's on them that way my screens are not full."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing,2018-11-13,Pros:Fast CPU handles everything quickly.,Cons:I don't know if I can complain it works nicely haven't really tried overclocking just let it to auto and have seen it go up to 4.3.ghz.,Other Thoughts:Will recommend if you can get an extra 15 dollars off do so its worth it.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Powerful Processor!,2018-11-12,Pros:-Silent Fan (a little loud when under heavy load but nothing crazy)-Gets the job done perfectly!-Powerful (upgraded from an i3-6100),Cons:-No cons at the moment,Other Thoughts:-I would highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their desktop!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Coming from a 4 year old 4790k,2018-11-10,Pros:High core count at a decent price,Cons:Not an overclockerTurbo is good for only 3.95 using excellent memory and bumping voltageAMD still uses pins that bend easyCooler ratings are hype - too loud and temps on stock clocking still hit 65C,Other Thoughts:This long and hard about upgrading.  I honestly think I made a big mistake based on review hype.  This was my first round with AMD in 10 years or so.  Very disappointed overall.  Maybe 3% gains over my 4790k overall.  Ugh...
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent Upgrade,2018-11-04,"Pros:This processor is fast, but in a rather unconventional way. AMD is really onto something with their Inifinity Fabric on this CPU. While not everything is faster per se, there is a level of consistency when I am running programs/games with this processor installed.My model is the 2700X, upgrading from a Skylake i7 6700K. Clock for clock, this is a completely different beast. I was able to overclock my 6700K to 4.6 Ghz comfortably while my 2700X can't really push past 4.15 without running into temperature/power restrictions.I am currently playing games on a 1080 monitor that runs at 144 Hz.* Similar performance as my old i7 setup, even with different clock speeds while playing games. However, I get more CONSISTENCY with Ryzen. My 1% lows have drastically improved.* More cores/threads - Seems like a ""no duh"". On my i7 6700K, I had to really fiddle with some settings to stream with decent settings, and even then it was sketch. Out of the box, I don't have to mess with too much on my new Ryzen processor in terms of application priority, bitrate, etc.* Tuning memory timings yields results! If you aren't aware, or don't know, Ryzen benefits SIGNIFICANTLY from better quality memory.","Cons:* CPU runs pretty hot. If moving from Intel Skylake or earlier, upgrade your cooling solution.* You may also want to consider spending the money on a faster RAM kit from a reputable vendor. G-Skill FlareX modules reportedly work very well. This is a con as it may add cost to anyone's budget.","Other Thoughts:My particular memory kit is a Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro running 3000 Mhz @ CL 14-16-16-26. My system has passed every memory test I could throw at it. Very stable. Google ""Ryzen memory calculator"" and follow the instructions for tuning your particular memory kit.Due to my particular computer case, I am restricted to micro ATX or smaller motherboards. So I opted for the MSI B450M Mortar. While it has a parallel 4-phase VRM, that same  4-phase VRM is also on a large number of X470 motherboards.Gigabyte and ASUS for the same form factor disappoint with their power delivery solutions. As I planned on running this particular CPU, power delivery has to be at least halfway decent."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Price doesn't make sense...,2018-11-03,Pros:- Seems to be better for everyday computing compared to the intel 9700k,Cons:- Not nearly as good for gaming as the intel 9700k,"Other Thoughts:All the reviews say that if you're considering the intel core i5 9700k, you should go with the ryzen 7 2700x to save a few bucks.  However, the ryzen 7 2700x is $65 MORE expensive!!!  Scratching my head on this one...  So in my opinion, if you want a good gaming machine, then go with the intel core i5 9700k and save a few bucks.  The intel core i5 9700k is by far better for gaming.  The intel chips also supports 4k.  So if you might possibly every want to add a 4k bluray player to your computer, you will need the intel chip.  Also, just in my opinion, some might argue that the amd processors are more stable than they used to be, but I still don't trust amd as much as intel.  I've never had an intel processor fail for me personally, but I've had many amd processors fail and needed to be replaced.  And for the record I've never overclocked any of my processors...  I would have given amd another try this time around despite not being as good for gaming, but the price is just too high...  Go Intel!!!!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fast! Excited about this upgrade!,2018-11-01,Pros:Fast out of the box! I haven't even touched overclocking this thing yet. no need too imo! I have it paired with the stock cool . Besides the stock cooler the wraith prism software not detecting the software (I have it plugged in only via usb header) and the software says it cant detect it. ohwell! I can live with just the rainbow mode its defaulted at I have fallen in love with the colors changing!,Cons:None! wouldn't even gripe at the $310 price tag this chip is amazing value at that price!,Other Thoughts:have already reccomended it to many!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,This CPU is a BEAST!,2018-10-30,"Pros:Fast... Very very fast. Great Value for money, and the next closest one from the competition is $200 more with a more expensive motherboard.",Cons:None that I've found so far.,"Other Thoughts:I would recommend this to people that are looking for a very powerful CPU at a reasonable price. It's good to see AMD back in the game, with a competitive CPU. Now, let's work on those video cards guys!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Don't get a Power Hungry Thread,2018-10-30,Pros:- Low Power Consumption- Overclocks like The Algorithm- Sonic The Hedgehog,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:- If you don't want to blow the Bank, and want to save on Electricity Bills, while still Overclocking, then take the Leap."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Nice!,2018-10-30,Pros:-Installed flawlessly on my x370 Aorus Gaming 5 Mobo-Got it to 4.1GHz stable almost right away at Vcore 1.4 and Soc at 1.2-Good performance increase from Ryzen 1600 at 3.9GHz-I go it for $269 at the time. My 1600 was $219 when it came out.,Cons:-Couldn’t get it to 4.2GHz. Might of been my Mobo or need more voltage.-Wish it made me pancakes with what temps it gets but water cooling helped a lot with OC.,Other Thoughts:Get this instead of the 2700x if you want to save money or know how to OC.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Faster Than What It Replaces,2018-10-30,Pros:Good single core; very good multi-core.  Reasonable power consumption,Cons:None -- no AVX-512? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"Other Thoughts:Replaces an E3-1230v2, which despite some nebulous reviews on the internet, it replaces handily."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Great processor.,2018-10-30,"Pros:if you do your research, you should know what you are getting. It does everything what it says it can do, and i have no issues what so ever.","Cons:I got this bundled with a mother board and the mother boards color controller AURA is not compatible with the included RGB fan. This means that i have to use cooler masters software to change the color instead of using the RGB controller that controls the rest of my rigs colors. This is the only reason i gave it 3 stars. If you are going to include an RGB fan, it should be compatible with the motherboards you are bundling them with Newegg.OR... AMD, you need to have 2 cables, one for power and one for the RGB controller. This means any themes i pick using AURA are going to look out of place because of the stock CPU fan. Witch is a bumber because AURA is pretty great.","Other Thoughts:i would recommend the Processor to other people on performance, but i will be telling them to not use the included fan."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"From a 1090t to a 2700x, this CPU impresses!",2018-10-26,"Pros:- Excellent multithreaded performance- Incredibly price to performance ratio- Outstanding productivity performance- Excellent multitasking performance- Great gaming performance- 8 cores and 16 threads for under $330 USD!- True SMT, not hyperthreading- Significantly less security flaws than Intel's series- It CAN be overclocked above it's rated clock, but you need to play with BCLK, LLC, voltage and PBO (along with CPB).","Cons:- Does not clock as high as Intel (not really a con to me, but it might be to some!)","Other Thoughts:This has been an exceptional CPU. Windows 10 Pro runs beautifully, and I can do some many things at the same time, I actually can't max out the CPU in the real world. My 1090t was starting to struggle with modern games and rendering times, plus I've already overclocked it as far as I can go. The 2700x has met and exceeded my expectations across the board. I know that in theory, you could get 300fps with an Intel chip versus the 290fps with the Ryzen chip, but at the sacrifice of TDP and SMT and who wants to pay that much more for only a few FPS in games? I do more than game anyway.I make music, I program, I write, I compile source, I do a whole bunch of stuff including video editing. This is definitely the best all-around CPU you can possibly buy until Zen 2/Ryzen 3000 comes out.Highly, highly recommended."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome,2018-10-25,"Pros:Great performance of course. Paired with 16gb 3200mhz ram, and it's awesome. The stock cooler is excellent (cools the cpu really well, looks BEAUTIFUL, and is small so it doesn't block any ram slots), and the pre-applied stock thermal paste is working great. price is good, i would gladly pay more for this. comes with a cool sticker.","Cons:Installation wasn't difficult, but it wasn't super easy. the latch on the cooler is kind of a pain.","Other Thoughts:This cpu runs hot. 50-60 degrees while gaming, can be 75 in really cpu intensive stuff. don't worry about it, that's how it's supposed to be. totally safe at those temps."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Well Done AMD,2018-10-25,"Pros:I couldn't have asked for a better cpu. Paired with the Asus ROG Crosshair VII Hero X470 motherboard, M2 Samsung evo SSD, G.Skill Flare X Series (3200) 16GB, GTX 1080 ti, and a EVGA CLC 280 AIO. This build is lighting fast. Originally went for the i9-9900k upgrade but found it the less attractive buy and canceled my pre-order for various reasons. I couldn't have made a better choice. Great work amd.",Cons:A bit quirky with software.,Other Thoughts:Be advised some software doesn't work with well with amd. EVGA Liquid cooler software doesn't work and like many reviews of that cooler stated. By-passing the cooler and plugging directly into the motherboard Is required.Another important note. Do not use your old OS disk to install windows 10. It has been stated on many forums the old OS disks will cause freezing and lock ups. This was very much the case for me. Download newest install version onto a USB drive.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,2700X review,2018-10-20,Pros:Stock cooler is nice and will let it hit its advertised 4.35Ghz turboI have mine however on a H150i AIO runs cool never even seen it hit 60C during games. I do not have mine OC never plan on it better to just let it do its own thing.Using to own a I7 4790K before switching to ryzen the 1700 felt a little bit like a downgrade for some older games BUT this CPU is almost as good.Have it paired with a GTX 1080 and a 1440P 144hz panel this CPU doesn’t bottleneck my card at all in basically any title! GPU usage in GTA5 will sometimes only be around 80% usage but this happen to my 4790K at 4.7Ghz as well.Tips for buyers I don’t care what anyone says go to your motherboard’s memory compatibility list on their site and make sure the memory is supported on that board with Pinnacle Ridge! Don’t buy anything below 3200mhz either unless you only plan on using this with mid-range GPU’s or you aren’t a gamer.Geekbench 4 scores down below I’d love to link the site if newegg decided to be cooler than other people and allow it!4934 Single core27835 Multi-CoreCineBench R15 scoresSingle Core 179Multicore 1800,Cons:Isn't Zen 2 or Zen 3 Amd don't delay these launchesNot 100% why but it's not terrible but Intel systems boot way faster i had the same SSD's on my Haswell CPU and it booted in like 20 seconds this machine takes twice that time not a big issue however. Note this was like this on 2 different AM4+ boards. Probably has something to do with their AGESA.,Other Thoughts:I will be upgrading each time Amd comes out with a new CPU for around 350$ most of the time I can get half the money from just selling the older CPU! This is like my only hobby so most of the time I have the money haha
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Work nicely under loads,2018-10-19,"Pros:workhouse, easy install, cooler looks great and does the job plus 16 threads nothing not to like about it.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I'm impressed with performance and cost.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great performance and value,2018-10-18,"Pros:This is a lot of compute power for your money.  The stock cooler looks good & performs easily well enough if you're running it stock.  XFR2 provides safe dynamic overclocking based on current load & temperature.  For the first time in years I'm running my desktop CPU with a stock cooler and no manual overclock.  It performs great as-is, so I'm not really motivated to tinker with manual overclocking.  Yes, you can get better gaming performance with Intel but even as someone who enjoys 1080p gaming on a 144Hz monitor I'm very happy with the frame rates I'm getting with this processor.  Still, high frame-rate 1080p is where Intel makes the most sense ; at 1440p (and especially 4K) I wouldn't even consider Intel.  Next year you'll also have the option to drop a ZEN 2 processor into your mainboard with only a BIOS update required.","Cons:If you want the absolute most frames that you can get at 1080p (or even 1440p) and you don't care much about cost, this isn't the processor for you.","Other Thoughts:If you have good quality TIM on hand by all means use it, but the pre-applied TIM on the stock cooler is actually fine, and will perform better than your TIM if it's misapplied.  I recommend 3200 MHz memory for Ryzen processors.  Tight timings (like 14-14-14-34) will help performance, but 3200 MHz is the main thing so if you prefer to spend a bit less and get Cas16 memory that will be fine.  Look for memory that's advertised as Ryzen-compatible, and check the manufacturer's QVL to ensure compatibility with your mainboard.  Memory compatibility is much improved in 2nd-gen Ryzen but you can still avoid a potential headache by doing a little investigation before you place your order."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,What can I say. Wow.,2018-10-18,Pros:FAST. Incredible when paired with good ram. Blows the doors off my buddy's i7-6800k.,Cons:Cache and memory latency! 65ns? really? seems about average no matter what I stick in there!,"Other Thoughts:I'm really impressed with this chip. It's incredibly fast. It has a drawback or two, but it's more then worth every penny I spent. Came from an FX 8350, and the difference is incredible."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great CPU,2018-10-15,"Pros:Love it, used to have an Intel 2600K, an AMD FX9590.   Since Ryzen came out I'd rather go with AMD then Intel but still Nvidia for graphics (Till AMD brings out better cards which will be soon hopefully)",Cons:- None,Other Thoughts:I don't know if I'd purchase another 2700X CPU but planning a Ryzen build for my son running on a Ryzen 5 2400G CPU/APU but depending on when I start the build I'm hoping they will bring out a more powerful  CPU with built in graphics for cheap too. If I could afford another 2700X  I probably would buy it again though.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"All the cores, none of the monopoly",2018-10-15,Pros:-8 cores-easy 4ghz 24/7-smashes everything I throw at it.-Stock Cooler looks cool,Cons:-wasn't free,Other Thoughts:Happy with this CPU even if other CPUs have higher single thread performance or extreme frequencies.My first AMD CPU. Probably not buying Intel again.2700x/Asus x470 Prime Pro/F4-3200C16D-16GVKB
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great All-Around CPU,2018-10-14,"Pros:-Good Price-RGB cooler (even though that's a con, because the cooler could be better without the RGB).","Cons:-Stock cooler comes with too much thermal paste. When I went to remove it after testing it for a day, it wouldn't come off and was stuck to the CPU. The CPU ended up coming straight out with the cooler. Not cool. The CPU was still stuck to the bottom of the cooler. I had to twist it to get it off, and that created a very noticeable and deep scratch on the CPU's IHS.-Low quality thermal paste.-Thought I was going to break the cooler trying to get it locked. Just needed a LOT of force.","Other Thoughts:-I wouldn't recommend the stock CPU cooler, even though it looks great."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Simply excellent!  Game changer and a wake-up call for the competition.,2018-10-14,"Pros:The CPU is extremely fast and capable of annihilating all the tasks I have thrown at it, including gaming. The AMD PB2 and XFR2 work supremely well and eliminate any need or urges for overclocking. They provide a very smart dynamic auto-overclock based on the specific operating condition of the silicon.",Cons:The included Wraith Prism cooler does a good job of keeping the CPU cool but it is quite noisy.  I would highly recommend the Noctua NH-U12S SE-AM4 cooler for people who put priority on silent computing.,Other Thoughts:I am EXTREMELY pleased overall with the Ryzen 2700X and would very highly recommend it.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-10-14,Pros:- Works great and is fast.,Cons:- None so far,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Value,2018-10-14,Pros:can get this cpu and a high end x470 for the current asking price of a 9900k and this is only about 17 percent slower or less and it comes with a nice stock cooler. 8 core 16 threads. it games great and  runs circles around my old i7 950 and 2700k,Cons:its not the fastest but it right there. its down 17 percent at best to intel 9900k and almost half the price,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,No need to overclock. Great cooler.,2018-10-13,Pros:Comes with paste on the cooler. Very fast. Lots of programmability using RyzenzMaster.,Cons:Cheap paste. Scraped it off and used MX4. Didn't need to. Stock paste is good enough.,Other Thoughts:I really like this AMD CPU. AMD is finally TCOB. Good job AMD. Can't wait to try the 7nm stuff.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD RYZEN 7 2700X is an awesome processor!,2018-10-13,"Pros:-8 cores/16 threads with high enough frequency for a good price, with a good cooler tooFor the price, I would buy 2700X over Intel's 6 core/12 threads Core i7 8700K or i7 8086K any day. That holds true for gaming too. Yes, Intel chips have higher frequency, but some people reported that despite having more fps at lower resolution (1080P or 1440P), some games did not run as smooth as with 2700X, so overall experience was better with Ryzen  7 2700X. At 4K, you don't even get slightly lower fps with 2700X, 1 or 2 frames at the most, which is within the margin of error. Gaming is generally considered to be 2700X's week point, but it is really not, and at 4K resolution, there is no difference, no matter what high end video card you are going to use. Of course, if you do other things that can take full advantage of 8 cores/16 threads, 2700X wins against Intel's 6 core/12 threads i7 8700K or 8086K with no contest. Always read and watch the reviews to make up your own mind before you buy any processor!","Cons:-NoneI am personally extremely happy with my AMD RYZEN 7 2700X, including its gaming performance.","Other Thoughts:Intel is soon to release Core i9 9900K, which will also have 8 cores/16 threads, just like Ryzen 7 2700X. It is about time, considering that AMD had 8 core processors for about 1.5 years now (not counting CPUs before Ryzen) on the mainstream platform. I have no doubt that Intel's i9 9900K will have better performance than Ryzen 7 2700X. But then it comes down to price, and I am pretty sure that Intel's i9 9900K will be much more expensive for somewhat better performance than Ryzen  7 2700X, especially because of Intel's current production issues with 14 nm process. Intel's i9 9900K should cost $488 US (not CAD) when released. To be honest, if you want 8 core/16 threads processor and if you are after gaming performance, I would suggest to get AMD's 2700X (not Intel's i9 9900K), and put the difference towards a better video card, which would in general improve your performance in gaming way more than getting Intel's i9 9900K alone. That being said, you don't necessarily need 8 core/16 threads processor for gaming in 2018, but I would recommend it, considering that you may want to keep it for a while. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if it is worth buying Intel's i9 9900K or i7 8700K or i7 8086K or any other processor over Ryzen 7 2700X."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,NICE!,2018-10-11,Pros:-Will do light work of basicaly anything-Nice cooler in the box,Cons:-none so far,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Wow,2018-10-05,Pros:So fast it cought me of guard at 1st.   Everything runs super smooth and fast.  Replaced my 6700k.Paired with MSI Carbon Pro and G Skill 3200mhz memory.Everything Worked like a charm.  Didn't even had to re-install windows it just worked.  I will reset windows just in case.Stock cooler is good.  I was playing cs go with an open case and my temps were 49-51 Celsius which is insanely cool.,"Cons:Fan a bit loud, but its not a big deal",Other Thoughts:Recommended this prdouct to few of my friends and they got it too.None of them any any issues so far.Good Job AMD and welcome back in the CPU world.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent processor,2018-10-04,Pros:I really like the speed this processor has.  The stock fan is quite enough for what I need.  I like the stock fan being RGB.  The whole thing works great with my Gigabtye X470 Aorus.  The CPU fan is very quiet.,Cons:Cons are required but not necessary with this product.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,1,"DON""T BUY ***READ***",2018-10-01,"Pros:Below is my original review, go to CON's.I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 and upgraded from an Intel i7-6700k. The Meltdown and Spectre patches killed my performance and became unbearable. This CPU with the Gigabyte X470 Auros Motherboard surpassed my expectations. The performance in spectacular. I use it for development and compiles/builds have noticeably improved.",Cons:AMD has introduced a performance penalty in their latest update to their AGESA 1.0.0.4 Microcode. This update decreases the multi-threaded performance of the CPU by more than 15%.I have been in contact with Gigabyte and they acknowledged the problem and w﻿ere able to reproduce the results as well. The performance decrease can be noticed using real world applications and synthetic benchmarks such as Passmark's PerformanceTest.Gigabyte said they would be contacting AMD about the issue.My guess at the moment is a variant of Spectre flaw was patched and has critically hindered the performance and AMD just silently didn't tell anyone.Be warned for anyone buying the Ryzen 7 2700x and getting the expected performance that has been reported in the past. This patch has hit the overall performance of the CPU.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,its ryzen 7 2700x!,2018-09-30,"Pros:RGB on the wraith prism cooler looks fancy and syncing well with motherboard RGBs with proper software.very strong multicore processing, it gets my video rendering work done really fast.for my 4k gaming experience along with vega 64 GPU, this ryzen 7 2700x does superb work with no bottleneck.for OCers the stock RGB cooler decent jobs cooling down the CPU and low fan noise, I would not spend money on aftermarket coolers for light overclocking on this CPU though.",Cons:none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Productivity Processor,2018-09-30,Pros:This is a very fast processor.  It is great for a mix of productivity and gaming performance.  Comes with a cooler that has optional RGB.,Cons:Limited PCIE lanes limits the number of M.2 NAND drives and high performance graphics cards that can be used.,"Other Thoughts:I replaced my i7 6800K with this. The two extra cores help with productivity and the higher based/turbo clocks make it great for games.  I thought about going with the best i7, but all the coolers excluding custom loop water, disinterested me and I did not want to spend the extra cash for it.I chose the X over the non-X to get higher clock frequencies for better gaming performance.  I have not overclocked this processor as it is fast enough for me without overclocking.  I need stability and this processor, even with the included cooler, is solid.I have not found out how to control the inner ring of the RGB on the cooler to keep it from color changing.  But it looks cool, so I stopped fiddling with it."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Pretty Awesome for 3D Modeling and Gaming,2018-09-30,Pros:Got to clock to 4.15Ghz across all cores at 1.2875V which is awesome for temperatures and productivity. Scoring an 1874 on cinebench was a good sight. It does anything and everything you could want without too much of a hiccup once you get it tuned in.,"Cons:The Voltages at stock are a little crazy if your board automatically applies an all core clock speed. I saw it fluctuate from .9~ish volts @2.8Ghz to 1.55v at 4.3Ghz, just from the stock settings with the board auto-applying the All Core Boost. This made my processor sit at roughly 80-85 Degrees C Tdie (90-95 C Tctl). That temperature was a tad uncomfortable for me and it climbed easily when the GPU was also pushing heavy loads. The only thing I wish is that in the future AMD makes sure that features which can cause an auto-overclock are disabled by default as some people may never check for this sort of thing.","Other Thoughts:I'd still recommend this over Intel if you want your computer to perform well in a variety of different tasks, such as: Gaming, Recording, 3D Modeling, Game Development, Video Editing, etc.With the Vega 64 Listed below, I've been getting 100-120fps (Locked at 120fps) on Fortnite at 1080p@Max, 65-75 FPS in Doom at 4k@Max, and am getting great performance in blender for modeling.System:Ryzen 2700xCooler: MA610Px470 TaichiG.

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Powerhouse!,2018-09-28,Pros:8 Core/16 Thread performance I barely reach 50% load during gaming/everyday tasks (gaming). I upgraded from an Intel i7 3770K which was decent for 1440p gaming though would bottleneck with 4K gaming. AMD 2700X Handles 4K like a champ with room to spare. I'm still troubleshooting clock and memory speeds. Currently workingat 4.3GHz @ 1.4+/-. Very pleased with where AMD is going and how they are tackling Intel. Healthy Competition is always welcomed.,Cons:Little headroom beyond 4.3GHz though considering this is an 8 core CPU that's understandable. AMD is still innovating! Pending Zen 3 @ 7nm.Stock cooler is adequate if you do not plan on overclocking anything. You can try to overclock on air though will see temps spike past your comfort zone. Cinebench on air would push me to 90-100+ Celsius and Idle temps would fluctuate between 60-70c. Now granted I did not use thermal paste. I used a thermal graphite pad. I'm currently using thermal paste with a custom water loop that has improved temps and clock speeds. You may have different results. Take mine experience with a grain of salt.,Other Thoughts:Current Rig:Ryzen 2700X X 43GHzAsus X470 Crosshair VII WifiCorsair 32GB GDDR4 3466MHz running at 3200MHz Stable2 x EVGA 1080 Hybris in SLICorsair HX1000iCorsair 570X RGB Crystal Case White
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Wow this thing is fast.,2018-09-27,Pros:Just use the wraith spire included with this CPU. I bought an AIO water cooler and quite frankly I wasted a lot of money on it. Just use the cooler the box has inside of it.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Would have been nice to have some detailed instructions on how to install this entire thing. At least include a how to.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD is back,2018-09-26,"Pros:FAST. Don't let the benchmark hardcore geeks fool you, this chip from AMD put them back into the game big time. If you are a hardcore custom building OC'ing ultra computer nerd, then you are likely going to find more hobby potential somewhere else. If you are everyone else, gamer, graphics design, whatever, then this is the chip for you. AMD's own fancy little algorithm does an amazing job of optimizing power use and boost clock performance without having to touch anything. It's plug and play speed.","Cons:None? I have heard these chips run hot, but i built my rig with a liquid cool set up from the get go so i couldn't say. The included air cooler is huge and fancy and looks like a part from a space shuttle or something, so odds are even if it runs hot AMD has you covered with that thing. I went liquid because I have in the past and IMO more stable temps also means more life and less fan noise. Especially the fan noise part.","Other Thoughts:Now is the time to give AMD a shot. This chip is bonkers. I picked up a Vega 64 GPU to go with it, a lot because of price but also because the (hard to find) unbiased reviews gave it very high marks on par if not exceeding the 1080's. I hope AMD can design a GPU to put Nvidea on it's heels like they did to Intel with chip.I put this into a new rig using ASRock's Taichi mobo. What a brilliant combo it has been so far."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Fantastic package,2019-02-20,"Pros:This CPU is a powerhouse. Paired with my Crosshair VII Hero motherboard, overclocking it to get the most out of the cores and the RAM, alongside a RTX 2080 has me running all current triple-A games well beyond 60FPS at maximum settings.Installation was a breeze. Chip slid right in and the heatsink/fan that came with it snapped right on to the motherboard's mounts with zero issues.The LEDS are beautiful and absolutely mesmerizing to watch.","Cons:The fan is VERY loud when under loads. It's not a consistent noise, but it will do a sporadic burst of high RPM that hits nearly 56dba to quickly cool down the processor, then it quiets down for a few minutes thereafter.","Other Thoughts:I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking to get a great CPU for their money. Keep in mind, if you don't like a noisy cooling system, you might want to look into a different one than the one that comes with the CPU."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Smoking fast,2019-02-19,Pros:It does everything but drive me to work !,Cons:No pretty stickers to put on the side of my case.,Other Thoughts:Yes Yes Yes Get this CPU you won't be disappointed.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great piece of hardware,2019-02-18,Pros:Runs very well for gaming and multitasking.,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:I would absolutely recommend and have this item.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Product! Easy to Setup and Use!,2019-02-18,Pros:what you liked about the product: everythingmy job (taking over the world) was definitely made easier by the product!not there yet but almost lol,Cons:- What did you not like about the product?liked everything!How could it be improved?i dunno! f f s ! i dont work in the computer hardware industry lol- Let others know if any of the problems you encountered can be resolved or avoided.no problems thus far so stop bringing that sh 1 T  up!- Be sure to include any bugs or defects.Again none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great for gaming,2019-02-17,Pros:i got mine to OC at 4.1GHZ at 1.35V stable,Cons:none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Would have worked great.,2019-02-16,Pros:It's fast,Cons:The pins are fragile. Wish they'd stop using pins,"Other Thoughts:I know this is a great CPU, I know it would have done everything I asked of it. I know that it, in many ways is superior to Intel. I just wish they didn't use pins. Accidents do happen, pins do get bent, and when they do, AMD doesn't do anything to help you..You'd think they'd plan ahead for accidents to happen knowing that they use pins instead of pads. That people aren't perfect. Instead, they'd rather leave you hanging with a $300 gold plated paperweight that you spent months saving up for, and that is so heartbreaking...This new build was suppose to be a chance to make some money from home ""I'm disabled"" and now I can't...So yea, I only docked the one point because of the pins and how unwilling AMD is to help you if you have any kind of accident...If I ever get a chance to buy a new one ""Which will take who knows how long"" I'll update this review."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great processor hard to overclock,2019-02-14,Pros:Been using this for several months now and I have to say it is a fast processor.One thing to keep in mind is that its internal built features it keeps track of how hot it is and will downclock itself if it gets to hot. I've noticed the better the cooling the more it overclocks itself and keeps the overclock (yes it does this on its own and does not need anyone to tweek the settings).,Cons:If you try and manually overclock it you may have issues trying to get it stable. It is really not needed. You should focus more on keeping it as cool as you can so it can overclock itself.,Other Thoughts:None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Big power savings,2019-02-11,"Pros:Despite the fact that it's listed at 105W, this saves a lot of power over an FX 8350 both at idle and at max throughput. I assume that's because it calculates & completes OS requests so much faster, therefore obviating the need to keep it running at higher wattage for longer periods of time. I discovered this pleasant surprise by monitoring a UPS regularly for the first few weeks.","Cons:It is often said that AMD does not support using the 2700x on Windows 7, when in fact they leave that up to the motherboard manufacturers and Microsoft. If it doesn't work on Windows 7, the motherboard makers and Microsoft will just point fingers at each other.",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Processor,2019-02-11,Pros:- Price is very good- Runs great- AMD Wraith Prism Cooler is wonderful and not very loud- Upgraded my computer with this and it is doing a wonderful job and stays a lot cooler than my older processor,Cons:None that I can think of,Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this product!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Works almost perfectly... Almost a full RG(B) cooler.,2019-02-10,Pros:The CPU was able to hold an overclock of 17% and remain fairly cool in the process. Flawlessly installed and easyA Value for sure and worth buying.,Cons:Well.... Here is the almost. The Wraith cooler that is on the CPU is beautiful if it wasn't for the BLUE LED not working. This absolutely sucks.I would think that the tech would have spotted this in the testing before shipping but they didn't. The CPU has won the silicone lottery but the LED Wraith Cooler is a huge disappointment.,Other Thoughts:I would recomend this CPU but would be really careful if you are needing the RGB lighting for a special build as you might run into problems with it being able to produce the effect that is necessary for your install.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great CPU,2019-02-10,Pros:I waited a month before writing my reviews on the build I put together with boxing day sales. I picked up this CPU on sale and so far I can say that I have no complaints. The cooler that it came with was effective enough to keep the temperatures nice and stable (around 68 deg C).My only recommendation is to get some good after market thermal paste for the CPU. The stuff that is pre-applied will probably be ok but I wouldnt risk it personally.,"Cons:No cons yet, if anything changes, I will update","Other Thoughts:Just for reference, my build is: Ryzen 7 2700, 16GB G.Skill Trident 3200, ASUS Prime X-470 Pro mother board, MSI RX Vega 64 Airboost. I also have two Corsair 140mm magnetic fans for intake cooling set up with positive pressure. The case is a Carbide 270R (which is a great budget case if you are building a decent computer and want good cooling with lots of room)"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Glad I switched back to AMD,2019-02-08,Pros:- 8c/16t monster of a chip for half the price of the 9900k.,Cons:- None so far.,"Other Thoughts:Sure the 9900k beats Ryzen when trying to squeeze out every possible frame, but not enough to justifying spending double in my opinion. You can buy this chip, a decent b450/x470 board and ram for around the same price as the 9900k alone, which is insane. Can't wait for Ryzen 2."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Works great,2019-02-07,"Pros:Chip works amazing in my gf's new computer, she runs every game on ultra, along with a good GPU, and ram, definitely recommend it, and considerably cheaper than getting an i-7 or i-9",Cons:havent found any,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Very Happy,2019-02-06,"Pros:- self OC is deadly, runs high 4.2 regularily.","Cons:- devours the memory, i run B450F 3333 with 16GB Vengence LPX 3333 and im only hitting like 78th percentile for memory on passmark because of it.",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Um, yeah. This thing is fantstic!",2019-02-01,"Pros:Got the Chip for just under 300.00 and for the price it is a great value.Only do 1080P gaming, and paired it with a Vega 64, and has been a great comboGreat in Blender and anything else I throw at it.",Cons:Really can't think of any,"Other Thoughts:Chip like to stay cool to get most of XFR. Under custom whole house water loop, I can get 4.4ghz benchable and 4.3 stable on all cores. Under full load, chip stays under 45*C. Without the custom loop, 4.3 was hard to achieve.Not sure why some are saying the performance was killed with AGESA updates. Haven't noticed this, but also on 1.0.0.6"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Great Cpu, Easy overclocking",2019-01-31,"Pros:I was able to manage a stable over clock of 4.2 on the factory cooler that comes with this cpu, Through bios. I was extremely surprised, Handles gaming like a breeze at ultra settings if paired with a proper graphics card.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Finally a good rival for Intel,2019-01-31,Pros:- Pretty much an overkill for any specs for further games to come- Amazing driver (AMD Ryzen Master)- It will boost to 4.3 ghz with the default setting (it will fluctuate from 2.4 ghz to 4.3 ghz on heavy load)- I manually set it to stay at 4.1ghz and go to 4.3ghz-ish on heavy load- Doesn't bottleneck with my RTX 2080,"Cons:- Took a long time to ship, it comes from the US so expect a long shipping time (roughly two weeks)- Nothing else","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this product to anyone, I always been a fan boy of AMD cpu but the last time I had to build myself a pc, AMD wasn't doing cpus anymore so I had to go with Intel. I'm SO glad to be back with AMD !"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Good CPU,2019-01-30,Pros:Not easily overloaded. most of the time works with minimal efforts for middle range tasks.,Cons:System not noticeably faster than AM3+Too costly as an overall build versus benefits (If upgrading from AM3),"Other Thoughts:AMD could include a taller heat sink and quiet fan, we'll pay for it. The included sink and its fan are j a joke."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Runs great on Linux,2019-01-29,"Pros:I compile like no other. Great for dev, gaming and other computing hobbies. It runs beautifully on Linux.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Very solid indeed.,2019-01-29,"Pros:-I've been running this for 8 months and have had 0 problems.-The included wraith spire fan is awesome, even though im using an AIO water cooler.-I'm overclocking over the max boost limit with 0 issues and cool temps.",Cons:-none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing all the way HELLS TO THE YES!!,2019-01-23,Pros:Everything about my build using this processor was pretty much flawless!!,Cons:none!,Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this processor to everyone who wants to build a bad @ $ $ box!!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,NOW I'M PLAYING WITH POWER!!!,2019-01-22,Pros:This processor is out of sight! It was easy to install and the WRAITH cooler it comes with really does the job! Stressing it for over 15 minutes and it still stayed at no higher than 80 degress C. This is a great alternative to the rising prices of the Intel chips. Try this and you won't be disappointed. The WRAITH  cooler has RGB and it is addressable but you have to download the softwarefrom AMD's website in order to change the colors on it. And you also have to use the USB cable that comes with it and plug it into a RGB  header on the motherboard also.,Cons:None.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2019-01-21,Pros:the delivry was very fast and the cpu work perfectly fine. The fan that come up with the cpu its pretty amazing as well,Cons:did have any problem.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,good processor,2019-01-20,Pros:just got it and hooked it up in my new PC build runs AC odyssey on full blast with no issues-the prism cooler is having no trouble keeping it cool did ben mark on cineabench with no overclocking and temps got no higher than 67c-adjusting the RGB was a sinch with the coolmaster paneli-,Cons:for the free game they want you to subscribe to there newsletter no big deal until they want you to download a program to verify the processor and I got a error the said pct wasn't genuine maybe cause I need a windows key but still if they want a verification they could ask for the recipe from new egg or something instead of downloading a program that most ppl will unistall after they got the game waiting till I get the cash to activate windows if I still have trouble looks like ill be calling them ...,Other Thoughts:will recommend and keep buying from AMD its cheaper than intel and be honest with gaming ppl not rly going to notice any difference wife got a i7 and I rly dont see anything different at least with the games now days
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,great cpu for professional workloads,2019-01-13,"Pros:Great for video editing, great for streaming, okay for gaming, overclock okayish on the stock cooler but better to leave it at stock settings instead, lots of cores and threads","Cons:Stock cooler can get loud, isn't best performer for gaming.",Other Thoughts:If you are just gaming get the ryzen 5 2600x or ryzen 5 2600 with an aftermarket cooler and it will be better than this cpu. Other than that this cpu is a beast!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,works great!,2019-01-12,Pros:a lot more performance than my old ryzen 3 2200g,Cons:canot overclock like intel at 5 ghz,None

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome Awesome sauce!  Best value for overall performance.  They are pushing Intel aside.,2019-01-11,Pros:Super fast for multitasking.  I run virtual machines all day long for work and then game sometimes in the evenings and this thing does it all.  I don't even need to close any VMs to load a game.  I also can stream 4k on one monitor and game on the other with a VM loaded on the 3rd.  Get full 75FPS (freezync) on the game monitor with no frame drop.*****---Buy this now and sell it on *online_marketplace* when the Ryzen 3000 (16 core 5GHz) comes out in ~6 months.,Cons:Get DDR4 3000 RAM that is approved for your x470 motherboard.  It can be hard to tweak RAM perfectly for this CPU and base 2100MHz will starve this CPU.  Don't overclock the cores at all.  Just get RAM that will run at least 3000 and you are golden.,Other Thoughts:Includes cooler!Great on ~$120 x470 motherboardsGet AMD approved DDR4 3000+ RAM and make sure to set it right in BIOS.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Computer turned on the first time!!!,2019-01-06,"Pros:I can write code, watch Netflix, listen to Pandora, track the stock market, and play a game or two all at the same time.",Cons:Runs a bit hotter than I like with Noctua NH-D15 SE-AM4.Limited clock speed.,"Other Thoughts:Will be upgrading to 3700X, AM4 socket FTW."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Wish I could rate 4.5/5,2019-01-05,"Pros:The cpu is priced right and the cooler makes a great gift to a friend if you plan to go aftermarket, I gave it to my friend with a 2600 build.  With my Cooler Master AIO liquid cooler I'm able to get the cpu to 4.3 GHz on all cores and have zero stability issues.  Temps max out at about 73C so still plenty of headroom for cooling even when under 100% utilization.  Able to stream while gaming and will be doing some video editing as well.","Cons:I currently have an Rx 580 and upgraded to a RTX 2070, but my performance didn't increase all that much in PUBG, maybe only 10fps, this may be because the CPU was bottlenecked even at 4.3ghz the IPC is still not as good as a 8700k from Intel at 5ghz.  I wish I could overclock this thing higher to get that performance, so I returned my 2070 :( I guess you can say this cpu saved me 800 bucks? Or maybe it was my guilt for spending 800 dollars on a GPU.","Other Thoughts:Can't wait to see where Zen 2 goes, AMD is on the right track to keep competition in the PC component marketplace."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Gets the job done,2019-01-04,Pros:It doesn't have a problem with anything I throw at it.,Cons:It runs warm even with a 240mm liquid cooler.,Other Thoughts:I tried overcooking this processor and only have success to 4.1 GHz. Heat doesn't seem to be the issue at all as it stays under 65C overcooked to 4.1 GHz anything above that and I experience stability issues.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Budget Beast,2018-12-31,Pros:Does everything it claimsEasy set upComes with cooler if you don't want to spend any extra cash,Cons:Nothing of the top of my mind.,"Other Thoughts:Runs great, affordable, easy to use. I swapped out the cooler they included (which is not a bad cooler by any means) for liquid cooling, but love it so far."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,slightly deceptive,2018-12-31,Pros:I literally just received the package. haven't tried it out yet.,"Cons:the box was kind of crushed. the CPU box was fine and upon further inspection everything inside was undamaged.However, printed on the side of the box, and the front, it says that contained in this box is a AMD processor, AMD thermal solution, installation instructions, and warranty info.now I may be thinking that thermal solution is referring to the mall paste but I think they mean the fan and heatsink. But, there are no installation instructions at all.",Other Thoughts:missing the instructions isn't a downside for me. I've been building computers for a while so I don't really need them.I just thought I'd share that.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best Value processor for gaming,2018-12-29,Pros:Runs everything wellCan also stream at decent setting while playing,Cons:None so far,"Other Thoughts:I put this in with a thermaltake aio cooler and haven't seen it go above 55 celsius even after long gaming sessions. Great power, great price (I paid around $260 on BF), and runs flawlessly"

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Decent Processor,2018-12-24,"Pros:Great upgrade from my FX8350, paired with an Asrock X470 Taichi and 16GB of GSkill Trident 3200 MHz Memory.  Much faster than my previous system, glad I waited for the Ryzen 2000 series before upgrading.","Cons:The Ryzen 7 CPU's, the 2700X specifically uses a +10 degree temperature offset to maintain fan consistency.  I've noticed with my setup that due this +10 degree temperature offset, that my system doesn't boost as high as it can.",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,good processor,2018-12-20,Pros:8 cores 16 threads for less then 500 bucks. solid performance all around good buy. the motherboards are pretty cheap compared to the blue team.,Cons:needs expensive ram to gain performance. Its ok at overclocking but oc the ram brings better performance.,Other Thoughts:havnt had a problem out of the chip like at all. no patches have slowed down performance like intel has. bc of the core count and performance will be a good chip for yrs to come.

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,great cpu and great price,2018-12-19,Pros:fast cpu with a rgb cooler,"Cons:some bug for using old version win 10, must download the newest windows if use this cpu",None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing performance!,2018-12-18,"Pros:- Performance is really satisfying!- Temperature is not bad with stock wraith cooler, 40 degrees at idle and around 60 under very heavy load- Wraith cooler is really shiny!- Really good deal, I got it for only 330 CAD during Black Friday.",Cons:None really so far!,"Other Thoughts:The PGA type CPU is still very hard to work with. Extremely easy to pull the entire CPU out when uninstalling the cooler, and if you happen to drop the CPU on the floor, you are pretty much in big trouble. Hope AMD can switch to LGA soon."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Faster Than My AMD FX 9590.,2018-12-18,Pros:Love this Processor 40% Improvement over my AMD FX 9590 Rig.Runs Cool with the EVGA 280 Closed Loop Water Cooler.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Will be Purchasing more of these in the Future for my other PC Upgrades.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fantastic,2018-12-15,"Pros:We all know the Ryzen 7 is awesome, but I didn't expect the included cooler (Wraith Prism) to be good enough for my purposes. It very much is. The thing takes everything I can throw at it from Prime95 without breaking 75C.",Cons:None!,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Super fast and a bargain for the price.,2018-12-15,Pros:Fast CPU and comes with a stock cooler saving the additional purchase.  Acquired it as a Combo with the ASRock x470 Mobo. Both are terrific and easy to install.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Highly recommend.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,excellent,2018-12-13,Pros:Fast;Does everything I want;,Cons:Noisy stock cooler,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Bang for the buck can't beat it.,2018-12-12,Pros:Had the 8350 was time to upgrade. There is a big difference in performance between them. I kept my same video card and I'm not getting screen tearing and artifacts now.,Cons:None that I can think of everything was straight forward on installation.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing,2018-12-11,Pros:- multithreaded applications are amazing- gaming is amazing- absolutely fantastic cooler- runs cool 26 on idle and 56 in gaming and around 60 on a heavy work load.,Cons:I can't think of any to be honest.,Other Thoughts:This processor does not need to be overclocked it's not an Intel processor. If you have good cooling it will boost itself. My processor sits itself at 4.2ghz boost without me doing anything. Pair it up with 3000mhz of higher ram and it's an absolute monster of a processor. Why spend more on an Intel processor that you have to overclock or buy an aftermarket cooler for?I had the i7 7700k prior to this processor and I see a huge difference in performance between the two processors in both gaming and work applications.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"love it, Extremely fast.",2018-12-11,"Pros:Extremely fast with multiple threads and cores, good stock cooler, perfect for multithreaded workloads, works pretty decent for gaming.",Cons:Single core performance is a little lacking compared to Intel,Other Thoughts:I was able to overclock this baby to 4.2ghz at 1.3345v to the core. The cpu cooler gets a bit loud when you do this but it keeps it cool. The max temperature I got on my cpu so far with the overclock is 76*c
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent processeur,2018-12-09,"Pros:- Fonctionne super bien avec le radiateur fournit, fonctionne entre 4 et 4,1 ghz en permanence. il est seulement à 34 degrés Celsius (environ 12 au dessus de la température pièce) il monte à 65 degrés Celsius lors d'un test cinebench, dans cinebench j'ai fait un score de 1745 cu (sans l'avoir overclocker).","Cons:Pour le moment, rien.","Other Thoughts:Je recommande ce processeur, il est parfait. Je compte garder mon ordinateur pendant plusieurs années, c'est pour ça que j'ai acheter un processeur aussi cher."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Performs well as expected,2018-12-09,"Pros:I haven't done a lot of testing, but there are several other reviews out there already.I have the CPU running at stock settings. Speed boosts to 4.3 GHz when gaming, 4.1 Ghz running Prime95. CPU temp maxes out around 75 C with the included cooler.The Wraith Prism RGB lighting effects are cool...",Cons:The instructions are minimal. I had to search online what the included cables are for and what software is needed to control the RGB lighting on the cooler.,Other Thoughts:Bought it on sale during Cyber Monday. Definitely worth the price considering it has 8 cores.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing! Blazing Fast!,2018-12-09,Pros:Excellent product. It exceeded my expectations in performanceLove the RGB cooler fan!Runs cool when not overclockedGreat bang for your $$,Cons:None that I noticed,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,1,over heats easy,2018-12-07,Pros:- 8 cores- fast,Cons:- doesn't ram well enough- get hot very easy- the stock fan is trash,"Other Thoughts:This will be my last amd build after see how badly this worked with my 3,200 32gb gskill ram.  I'm building Intel next and I've been an AMD user my entire LIFE!!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD 2700X is a beast!!!,2018-12-04,Pros:8 cores.. 16 threads,Cons:none,"Other Thoughts:So i purchased this CPU last week.. I'm using it for both gaming and design..I didn't overclock it or anything and its running at 4.1ghz on my Asus mobo ( B450-F gaming)I use 2D and 3D design softwares and playing games such as BTF5, Assassins creed odyssey, GTAV etc.This CPU with my 1080 graphics card and 16gb 3200hz of memory run everything without any problem..Amazing performance and great price as always from AMD..I definitely recommend this cpu"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,1790-1815 Cinebench with stock cooler.,2018-12-04,"Pros:Incredible value propositionStock Cooler works well enough, little tricky to install (try unscrewing the retention bars on the motherboard if you can't get it on)Much improved Memory Stability.","Cons:CCX Interconnect latency. But we all better get used to it, chiplets are the future of processors.Voltages can reach 1.5v on the core during peak XFR. It's scary, and even though AMD Engineers say it's perfectly fine, it will never stop bugging you for some reason. (All core 4.0GHZ runs at a much more palatable 1.35V)Some Errata still exist, because Zen is a new architecture. Make sure your copy of Windows is up to date before installing a Zen CPU (Ideally create a new ISO with microsoft's helpful utility)","Other Thoughts:Not much to say, it's a CPU, it handles pretty much everything you throw at it.Yeah, it's not as fast as Intel's top shelf desktop stuff. Intel earned their place at the top through fair and foul means like any good corporation, so if the extra 5-20% performance is worth it to you (Depending on workload) by all means, go for it. Competitive gamers, and people who do render workloads that can leverage the IGPU especially would benefit more from Intel's CPUs, everyone else, wouldn't be able to tell the difference."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-12-03,Pros:Delivered quickly and for a reasonable price,Cons:We bought the wrong one,Other Thoughts:We heard this processor is bbn one of the best unfortunately we didn't check our socket type 1st and it didn't fit
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome,2018-12-02,"Pros:You get what everyone is raving about, really nice cooler.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Highly recommend.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Almost replaced an AMD FX with an i7-8700k, went with this at the last moment. No regrets!",2018-11-27,"Pros:- Has as many threads as my computer has gigabytes of RAM.- Great for workbench loads- Great for gaming loads- Great for Tornado Trouble- Comes with the Wraith Prism cooler, fully equipped with LED lighting and is the best stock cooler you will ever own (maybe even the best air cooler in general) [I actually switch from water back to air because of this cooler]- Much more power efficient than my old Piledriver CPU.",Cons:- CPU itself is not RGB,"Other Thoughts:As my title says, I used to own an FX-8320 that I somehow managed to overclock to almost 5 GHz on a 150 watt motherboard for 4 years. Don't ask how. I don't know. It just worked. My power supply's digital link says that the CPU was drawing almost 250 watts at times. Anyways, the FX-8320 was becoming slower and slower compared to the market, and the power consumption for such a slow CPU was absurd. I looked into upgrades and had planned an Intel i7-8700k build to replace my obsolete FX. Just before ordering, I stumbled upon this here Ryzen 7 2700X, and I'm glad I did.The Intel i7-8700k is only slightly faster in single- and quad-core programs. The Ryzen, however, is a multitasking behemoth that performs much better when utilizing its full power. Most games that I play are capable of multithreading to this level anyways. Some may debate me on which CPU is really the best, but my vote goes for this one. Great purchase!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Working Really Good, My First Team Red Experience",2018-11-27,"Pros:- Benchmarks real nice (compared to my old 4770K, you'd hope it was better right? 8] )- Running all my games, servers, etc real good- Made my storage system function better with the added PCI Lanes n'at- The cooler that comes with it is really cool, works well","Cons:- I have not found any really, if your my friends, ""it isn't from Team Blue, so it's no good"" LOL!",Other Thoughts:- It does run pretty hot underload but it never goes anywhere near too hot.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,In my Helios 500,2018-11-26,"Pros:Runs cool as a cucumber. Pushed it to 4.075GHZ whilst staying under 88 degrees. Most of the time it's at 4.0 GHZ and below 80 degrees.Builds code, machine learning models, games, audio/video/graphics.Truly a powerhouse!!!Great work AMD!",Cons:ABSOLUTELY NONE!,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Decent Upgrade,2018-11-22,Pros:- Tons of cores/threads- Semi decent stock clock speeds- Older am4 motherboard compatibility,Cons:- Intel is still a bit better for gaming because of single core performance-Don't expect turbo boost to go above 4.0GHz on stock clocks,"Other Thoughts:I originally bought a ryzen 1600, but then I bought a gtx 1080. I wanted to upgrade, but didn't feel like getting a whole new motherboard for an intel. This upgrade definitely helped my frames in demanding games. Video rendering and general tasks are noticeably snappier now. The upgrade was easier than expected. Just make sure you have the latest bios if you have an older am4 mobo. Put a H55 AIO cooler on it and never go above  60C. Future proof enough that some day I may overclock a tad."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,2700x is power,2018-11-21,"Pros:I've been with Intel for the last 10 years, and I wanted to try something different for a change, and for the price, I wanted to put the 2700x in the mix, paired with a Crosshair VI Extreme.  So far, the chip is incredible with multitasking and the entire Windows experience is smoother than my older 6700k.  I will admit, having 20-25 tabs open most of the time, VMs, and typical programming stuff ... the 2700x far outperforms the 6700k in multitasking no doubt.  All cores are used in Windows, which surprised me, and the rendering speed was well worth it when tested.  By the way, the Aura looks great!","Cons:I have G.Skill F4 3200C16D-GTZ memory, and it won't run 3200, need to keep it at 2933 (might be other timings).the 2700x runs hot, often hitting over 80 degrees celcius with the included stock cooler, which does get loud and keeps the clock rates lower, 3.9 with all cores 100% (but still above the rated 3.7) ... and truly uses all its 105 watts to power itself which surprised me more often than anticipated.  Gaming frame rates are lower than Intels, even my 6700k with many games, but, the experience has been smoother ... no more hiccups with cpu and drives.  Honestly, for $60 more, I should have bought the 8700k this summer when it was cheaper $449 for the 8700k, where I bought the 2700x for $429.","Other Thoughts:Going to put a AIO water cooling unit on it, see if the game changes.  I know that Ryzen likes 3466 memory, so, that too, might be the next purchase.  All this paired with 980 Pro 512GB for speed!BUT, for price ... the 2700x is by far, the best choice out there!  And I wanted something more for work, than play this time.  And it has not disappointed."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,I've never owned an Intel chip,2018-11-21,"Pros:- Fast, reliable and priced low- I've gotten all cores OC'd to 4.2 stable.  4.3 BSODs on Cinebench- Easy installation- Near instant boots with NVMe drive for OS.",Cons:- I'd like to see the thermals come down a bit.  I have a Dark Rock Pro 4 sitting on top of this thing with GC Extreme thermal paste and I am still getting high 30's low 40s idle.,Other Thoughts:- would recommend since team blue always tacks on like 200 to 300 bucks for equiv CPUs- I have done nothing that choked out this CPU.

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent Choice For The Budget Conscious,2018-11-18,Pros:-Lower price point makes it a good alternative for the budding pc builder/upgrader-Decent air cooler with fancy RGB color thingies-Good performance for the price value,"Cons:-Fans can get a bit loud (and CPU a bit warmer) during heavy usage-With that being said, you may want to reconsider an improved CPU cooler in later upgrades down the road","Other Thoughts:Old rig is 7 years old (i7 2700k) and showing it's age. I figured it's time for a new build. Since I game/draw/animate and stream and budget is an issue, I have to find that happy medium where it can do my current PC needs without breaking the bank.Originally was going for the i7 8700k since my old 2700k has served me well but the price point and my current financial situation forced me to look for alternatives which is the Ryzen series chips and I liked what I saw: it's ability to multi task with it's 8 physical cores/12 threads for various applications for it's price point and I figured I can use the extra money saved to invest in a GPU (RTX 2070) instead. The air cooler that comes with it is a nice enough entry level CPU air cooler instead of spending that saved extra money (which again, I spent it on the GPU instead) for an aftermarket CPU cooler.Sure, as far as performance goes compared to the i7 8700k option, this chip is just a tad bit behind in some aspects and then again, it excel in some areas. I knew what I will be getting with the Ryzen option and I'm totally fine with it.All in all, I was able to find that nice compromise between affordability, future proofing and it's enhanced ability to multi task. So for a budget gamer/artist/budding streamer like me, it's fills that quota quite fine.New rig is as follows:AMD 2700x CPU w/Wraith Spire CPU CoolerCorsair Vengeance RGB 16GB 3200MHzASUS RTX 2070 8GBx1TB Samsung EVO SSDx2 500GB M.2 SATA/NVME SSDx1 2TB HDD (from the old rig)EVGA G+ 750WCorsair 275R case"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,A beast of a processor.,2018-11-17,"Pros:Handles multi-threaded performance unlike any processor I've had, I decided to give my mother my 1700X as she was still using a i7 970. Now she has performance as well. I paired this was an ASRock Taichi Ultimate, and a 500gb m.2 with 16GB of Corsair Vengance Pro 3200. I put both my NVidia 1060ti's back in, and installed CentOS Linux as my host OS, and installed my Virtual Machines to a 1TB SSD the performance of this is unbelievable and I added an addition 16gb of memory in and boosted my VM's I run a dual 43"" Samsung 4k HDR Pro TVs as monitors.I am able to re-compress video files, run a game in ultra settings, and my CPU temps don't get over 52C, I have the Corsair H150i installed into a NXZT 440.",Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:Aside from the threadripper, this CPU will handle all the tasks you need. Also you can run linux without an issues, I made a clean install of CentOS with KDE Plasma, no issues. I have 4 task windows so I put my Windows VM's on them that way my screens are not full."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing,2018-11-13,Pros:Fast CPU handles everything quickly.,Cons:I don't know if I can complain it works nicely haven't really tried overclocking just let it to auto and have seen it go up to 4.3.ghz.,Other Thoughts:Will recommend if you can get an extra 15 dollars off do so its worth it.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Powerful Processor!,2018-11-12,Pros:-Silent Fan (a little loud when under heavy load but nothing crazy)-Gets the job done perfectly!-Powerful (upgraded from an i3-6100),Cons:-No cons at the moment,Other Thoughts:-I would highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their desktop!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Coming from a 4 year old 4790k,2018-11-10,Pros:High core count at a decent price,Cons:Not an overclockerTurbo is good for only 3.95 using excellent memory and bumping voltageAMD still uses pins that bend easyCooler ratings are hype - too loud and temps on stock clocking still hit 65C,Other Thoughts:This long and hard about upgrading.  I honestly think I made a big mistake based on review hype.  This was my first round with AMD in 10 years or so.  Very disappointed overall.  Maybe 3% gains over my 4790k overall.  Ugh...
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent Upgrade,2018-11-04,"Pros:This processor is fast, but in a rather unconventional way. AMD is really onto something with their Inifinity Fabric on this CPU. While not everything is faster per se, there is a level of consistency when I am running programs/games with this processor installed.My model is the 2700X, upgrading from a Skylake i7 6700K. Clock for clock, this is a completely different beast. I was able to overclock my 6700K to 4.6 Ghz comfortably while my 2700X can't really push past 4.15 without running into temperature/power restrictions.I am currently playing games on a 1080 monitor that runs at 144 Hz.* Similar performance as my old i7 setup, even with different clock speeds while playing games. However, I get more CONSISTENCY with Ryzen. My 1% lows have drastically improved.* More cores/threads - Seems like a ""no duh"". On my i7 6700K, I had to really fiddle with some settings to stream with decent settings, and even then it was sketch. Out of the box, I don't have to mess with too much on my new Ryzen processor in terms of application priority, bitrate, etc.* Tuning memory timings yields results! If you aren't aware, or don't know, Ryzen benefits SIGNIFICANTLY from better quality memory.","Cons:* CPU runs pretty hot. If moving from Intel Skylake or earlier, upgrade your cooling solution.* You may also want to consider spending the money on a faster RAM kit from a reputable vendor. G-Skill FlareX modules reportedly work very well. This is a con as it may add cost to anyone's budget.","Other Thoughts:My particular memory kit is a Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro running 3000 Mhz @ CL 14-16-16-26. My system has passed every memory test I could throw at it. Very stable. Google ""Ryzen memory calculator"" and follow the instructions for tuning your particular memory kit.Due to my particular computer case, I am restricted to micro ATX or smaller motherboards. So I opted for the MSI B450M Mortar. While it has a parallel 4-phase VRM, that same  4-phase VRM is also on a large number of X470 motherboards.Gigabyte and ASUS for the same form factor disappoint with their power delivery solutions. As I planned on running this particular CPU, power delivery has to be at least halfway decent."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Price doesn't make sense...,2018-11-03,Pros:- Seems to be better for everyday computing compared to the intel 9700k,Cons:- Not nearly as good for gaming as the intel 9700k,"Other Thoughts:All the reviews say that if you're considering the intel core i5 9700k, you should go with the ryzen 7 2700x to save a few bucks.  However, the ryzen 7 2700x is $65 MORE expensive!!!  Scratching my head on this one...  So in my opinion, if you want a good gaming machine, then go with the intel core i5 9700k and save a few bucks.  The intel core i5 9700k is by far better for gaming.  The intel chips also supports 4k.  So if you might possibly every want to add a 4k bluray player to your computer, you will need the intel chip.  Also, just in my opinion, some might argue that the amd processors are more stable than they used to be, but I still don't trust amd as much as intel.  I've never had an intel processor fail for me personally, but I've had many amd processors fail and needed to be replaced.  And for the record I've never overclocked any of my processors...  I would have given amd another try this time around despite not being as good for gaming, but the price is just too high...  Go Intel!!!!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fast! Excited about this upgrade!,2018-11-01,Pros:Fast out of the box! I haven't even touched overclocking this thing yet. no need too imo! I have it paired with the stock cool . Besides the stock cooler the wraith prism software not detecting the software (I have it plugged in only via usb header) and the software says it cant detect it. ohwell! I can live with just the rainbow mode its defaulted at I have fallen in love with the colors changing!,Cons:None! wouldn't even gripe at the $310 price tag this chip is amazing value at that price!,Other Thoughts:have already reccomended it to many!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,This CPU is a BEAST!,2018-10-30,"Pros:Fast... Very very fast. Great Value for money, and the next closest one from the competition is $200 more with a more expensive motherboard.",Cons:None that I've found so far.,"Other Thoughts:I would recommend this to people that are looking for a very powerful CPU at a reasonable price. It's good to see AMD back in the game, with a competitive CPU. Now, let's work on those video cards guys!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Don't get a Power Hungry Thread,2018-10-30,Pros:- Low Power Consumption- Overclocks like The Algorithm- Sonic The Hedgehog,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:- If you don't want to blow the Bank, and want to save on Electricity Bills, while still Overclocking, then take the Leap."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Nice!,2018-10-30,Pros:-Installed flawlessly on my x370 Aorus Gaming 5 Mobo-Got it to 4.1GHz stable almost right away at Vcore 1.4 and Soc at 1.2-Good performance increase from Ryzen 1600 at 3.9GHz-I go it for $269 at the time. My 1600 was $219 when it came out.,Cons:-Couldn’t get it to 4.2GHz. Might of been my Mobo or need more voltage.-Wish it made me pancakes with what temps it gets but water cooling helped a lot with OC.,Other Thoughts:Get this instead of the 2700x if you want to save money or know how to OC.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Faster Than What It Replaces,2018-10-30,Pros:Good single core; very good multi-core.  Reasonable power consumption,Cons:None -- no AVX-512? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,"Other Thoughts:Replaces an E3-1230v2, which despite some nebulous reviews on the internet, it replaces handily."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Great processor.,2018-10-30,"Pros:if you do your research, you should know what you are getting. It does everything what it says it can do, and i have no issues what so ever.","Cons:I got this bundled with a mother board and the mother boards color controller AURA is not compatible with the included RGB fan. This means that i have to use cooler masters software to change the color instead of using the RGB controller that controls the rest of my rigs colors. This is the only reason i gave it 3 stars. If you are going to include an RGB fan, it should be compatible with the motherboards you are bundling them with Newegg.OR... AMD, you need to have 2 cables, one for power and one for the RGB controller. This means any themes i pick using AURA are going to look out of place because of the stock CPU fan. Witch is a bumber because AURA is pretty great.","Other Thoughts:i would recommend the Processor to other people on performance, but i will be telling them to not use the included fan."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"From a 1090t to a 2700x, this CPU impresses!",2018-10-26,"Pros:- Excellent multithreaded performance- Incredibly price to performance ratio- Outstanding productivity performance- Excellent multitasking performance- Great gaming performance- 8 cores and 16 threads for under $330 USD!- True SMT, not hyperthreading- Significantly less security flaws than Intel's series- It CAN be overclocked above it's rated clock, but you need to play with BCLK, LLC, voltage and PBO (along with CPB).","Cons:- Does not clock as high as Intel (not really a con to me, but it might be to some!)","Other Thoughts:This has been an exceptional CPU. Windows 10 Pro runs beautifully, and I can do some many things at the same time, I actually can't max out the CPU in the real world. My 1090t was starting to struggle with modern games and rendering times, plus I've already overclocked it as far as I can go. The 2700x has met and exceeded my expectations across the board. I know that in theory, you could get 300fps with an Intel chip versus the 290fps with the Ryzen chip, but at the sacrifice of TDP and SMT and who wants to pay that much more for only a few FPS in games? I do more than game anyway.I make music, I program, I write, I compile source, I do a whole bunch of stuff including video editing. This is definitely the best all-around CPU you can possibly buy until Zen 2/Ryzen 3000 comes out.Highly, highly recommended."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome,2018-10-25,"Pros:Great performance of course. Paired with 16gb 3200mhz ram, and it's awesome. The stock cooler is excellent (cools the cpu really well, looks BEAUTIFUL, and is small so it doesn't block any ram slots), and the pre-applied stock thermal paste is working great. price is good, i would gladly pay more for this. comes with a cool sticker.","Cons:Installation wasn't difficult, but it wasn't super easy. the latch on the cooler is kind of a pain.","Other Thoughts:This cpu runs hot. 50-60 degrees while gaming, can be 75 in really cpu intensive stuff. don't worry about it, that's how it's supposed to be. totally safe at those temps."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Well Done AMD,2018-10-25,"Pros:I couldn't have asked for a better cpu. Paired with the Asus ROG Crosshair VII Hero X470 motherboard, M2 Samsung evo SSD, G.Skill Flare X Series (3200) 16GB, GTX 1080 ti, and a EVGA CLC 280 AIO. This build is lighting fast. Originally went for the i9-9900k upgrade but found it the less attractive buy and canceled my pre-order for various reasons. I couldn't have made a better choice. Great work amd.",Cons:A bit quirky with software.,Other Thoughts:Be advised some software doesn't work with well with amd. EVGA Liquid cooler software doesn't work and like many reviews of that cooler stated. By-passing the cooler and plugging directly into the motherboard Is required.Another important note. Do not use your old OS disk to install windows 10. It has been stated on many forums the old OS disks will cause freezing and lock ups. This was very much the case for me. Download newest install version onto a USB drive.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,2700X review,2018-10-20,Pros:Stock cooler is nice and will let it hit its advertised 4.35Ghz turboI have mine however on a H150i AIO runs cool never even seen it hit 60C during games. I do not have mine OC never plan on it better to just let it do its own thing.Using to own a I7 4790K before switching to ryzen the 1700 felt a little bit like a downgrade for some older games BUT this CPU is almost as good.Have it paired with a GTX 1080 and a 1440P 144hz panel this CPU doesn’t bottleneck my card at all in basically any title! GPU usage in GTA5 will sometimes only be around 80% usage but this happen to my 4790K at 4.7Ghz as well.Tips for buyers I don’t care what anyone says go to your motherboard’s memory compatibility list on their site and make sure the memory is supported on that board with Pinnacle Ridge! Don’t buy anything below 3200mhz either unless you only plan on using this with mid-range GPU’s or you aren’t a gamer.Geekbench 4 scores down below I’d love to link the site if newegg decided to be cooler than other people and allow it!4934 Single core27835 Multi-CoreCineBench R15 scoresSingle Core 179Multicore 1800,Cons:Isn't Zen 2 or Zen 3 Amd don't delay these launchesNot 100% why but it's not terrible but Intel systems boot way faster i had the same SSD's on my Haswell CPU and it booted in like 20 seconds this machine takes twice that time not a big issue however. Note this was like this on 2 different AM4+ boards. Probably has something to do with their AGESA.,Other Thoughts:I will be upgrading each time Amd comes out with a new CPU for around 350$ most of the time I can get half the money from just selling the older CPU! This is like my only hobby so most of the time I have the money haha
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Work nicely under loads,2018-10-19,"Pros:workhouse, easy install, cooler looks great and does the job plus 16 threads nothing not to like about it.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I'm impressed with performance and cost.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great performance and value,2018-10-18,"Pros:This is a lot of compute power for your money.  The stock cooler looks good & performs easily well enough if you're running it stock.  XFR2 provides safe dynamic overclocking based on current load & temperature.  For the first time in years I'm running my desktop CPU with a stock cooler and no manual overclock.  It performs great as-is, so I'm not really motivated to tinker with manual overclocking.  Yes, you can get better gaming performance with Intel but even as someone who enjoys 1080p gaming on a 144Hz monitor I'm very happy with the frame rates I'm getting with this processor.  Still, high frame-rate 1080p is where Intel makes the most sense ; at 1440p (and especially 4K) I wouldn't even consider Intel.  Next year you'll also have the option to drop a ZEN 2 processor into your mainboard with only a BIOS update required.","Cons:If you want the absolute most frames that you can get at 1080p (or even 1440p) and you don't care much about cost, this isn't the processor for you.","Other Thoughts:If you have good quality TIM on hand by all means use it, but the pre-applied TIM on the stock cooler is actually fine, and will perform better than your TIM if it's misapplied.  I recommend 3200 MHz memory for Ryzen processors.  Tight timings (like 14-14-14-34) will help performance, but 3200 MHz is the main thing so if you prefer to spend a bit less and get Cas16 memory that will be fine.  Look for memory that's advertised as Ryzen-compatible, and check the manufacturer's QVL to ensure compatibility with your mainboard.  Memory compatibility is much improved in 2nd-gen Ryzen but you can still avoid a potential headache by doing a little investigation before you place your order."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,What can I say. Wow.,2018-10-18,Pros:FAST. Incredible when paired with good ram. Blows the doors off my buddy's i7-6800k.,Cons:Cache and memory latency! 65ns? really? seems about average no matter what I stick in there!,"Other Thoughts:I'm really impressed with this chip. It's incredibly fast. It has a drawback or two, but it's more then worth every penny I spent. Came from an FX 8350, and the difference is incredible."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great CPU,2018-10-15,"Pros:Love it, used to have an Intel 2600K, an AMD FX9590.   Since Ryzen came out I'd rather go with AMD then Intel but still Nvidia for graphics (Till AMD brings out better cards which will be soon hopefully)",Cons:- None,Other Thoughts:I don't know if I'd purchase another 2700X CPU but planning a Ryzen build for my son running on a Ryzen 5 2400G CPU/APU but depending on when I start the build I'm hoping they will bring out a more powerful  CPU with built in graphics for cheap too. If I could afford another 2700X  I probably would buy it again though.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"All the cores, none of the monopoly",2018-10-15,Pros:-8 cores-easy 4ghz 24/7-smashes everything I throw at it.-Stock Cooler looks cool,Cons:-wasn't free,Other Thoughts:Happy with this CPU even if other CPUs have higher single thread performance or extreme frequencies.My first AMD CPU. Probably not buying Intel again.2700x/Asus x470 Prime Pro/F4-3200C16D-16GVKB
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great All-Around CPU,2018-10-14,"Pros:-Good Price-RGB cooler (even though that's a con, because the cooler could be better without the RGB).","Cons:-Stock cooler comes with too much thermal paste. When I went to remove it after testing it for a day, it wouldn't come off and was stuck to the CPU. The CPU ended up coming straight out with the cooler. Not cool. The CPU was still stuck to the bottom of the cooler. I had to twist it to get it off, and that created a very noticeable and deep scratch on the CPU's IHS.-Low quality thermal paste.-Thought I was going to break the cooler trying to get it locked. Just needed a LOT of force.","Other Thoughts:-I wouldn't recommend the stock CPU cooler, even though it looks great."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Simply excellent!  Game changer and a wake-up call for the competition.,2018-10-14,"Pros:The CPU is extremely fast and capable of annihilating all the tasks I have thrown at it, including gaming. The AMD PB2 and XFR2 work supremely well and eliminate any need or urges for overclocking. They provide a very smart dynamic auto-overclock based on the specific operating condition of the silicon.",Cons:The included Wraith Prism cooler does a good job of keeping the CPU cool but it is quite noisy.  I would highly recommend the Noctua NH-U12S SE-AM4 cooler for people who put priority on silent computing.,Other Thoughts:I am EXTREMELY pleased overall with the Ryzen 2700X and would very highly recommend it.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-10-14,Pros:- Works great and is fast.,Cons:- None so far,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Value,2018-10-14,Pros:can get this cpu and a high end x470 for the current asking price of a 9900k and this is only about 17 percent slower or less and it comes with a nice stock cooler. 8 core 16 threads. it games great and  runs circles around my old i7 950 and 2700k,Cons:its not the fastest but it right there. its down 17 percent at best to intel 9900k and almost half the price,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,No need to overclock. Great cooler.,2018-10-13,Pros:Comes with paste on the cooler. Very fast. Lots of programmability using RyzenzMaster.,Cons:Cheap paste. Scraped it off and used MX4. Didn't need to. Stock paste is good enough.,Other Thoughts:I really like this AMD CPU. AMD is finally TCOB. Good job AMD. Can't wait to try the 7nm stuff.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD RYZEN 7 2700X is an awesome processor!,2018-10-13,"Pros:-8 cores/16 threads with high enough frequency for a good price, with a good cooler tooFor the price, I would buy 2700X over Intel's 6 core/12 threads Core i7 8700K or i7 8086K any day. That holds true for gaming too. Yes, Intel chips have higher frequency, but some people reported that despite having more fps at lower resolution (1080P or 1440P), some games did not run as smooth as with 2700X, so overall experience was better with Ryzen  7 2700X. At 4K, you don't even get slightly lower fps with 2700X, 1 or 2 frames at the most, which is within the margin of error. Gaming is generally considered to be 2700X's week point, but it is really not, and at 4K resolution, there is no difference, no matter what high end video card you are going to use. Of course, if you do other things that can take full advantage of 8 cores/16 threads, 2700X wins against Intel's 6 core/12 threads i7 8700K or 8086K with no contest. Always read and watch the reviews to make up your own mind before you buy any processor!","Cons:-NoneI am personally extremely happy with my AMD RYZEN 7 2700X, including its gaming performance.","Other Thoughts:Intel is soon to release Core i9 9900K, which will also have 8 cores/16 threads, just like Ryzen 7 2700X. It is about time, considering that AMD had 8 core processors for about 1.5 years now (not counting CPUs before Ryzen) on the mainstream platform. I have no doubt that Intel's i9 9900K will have better performance than Ryzen 7 2700X. But then it comes down to price, and I am pretty sure that Intel's i9 9900K will be much more expensive for somewhat better performance than Ryzen  7 2700X, especially because of Intel's current production issues with 14 nm process. Intel's i9 9900K should cost $488 US (not CAD) when released. To be honest, if you want 8 core/16 threads processor and if you are after gaming performance, I would suggest to get AMD's 2700X (not Intel's i9 9900K), and put the difference towards a better video card, which would in general improve your performance in gaming way more than getting Intel's i9 9900K alone. That being said, you don't necessarily need 8 core/16 threads processor for gaming in 2018, but I would recommend it, considering that you may want to keep it for a while. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if it is worth buying Intel's i9 9900K or i7 8700K or i7 8086K or any other processor over Ryzen 7 2700X."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,NICE!,2018-10-11,Pros:-Will do light work of basicaly anything-Nice cooler in the box,Cons:-none so far,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Wow,2018-10-05,Pros:So fast it cought me of guard at 1st.   Everything runs super smooth and fast.  Replaced my 6700k.Paired with MSI Carbon Pro and G Skill 3200mhz memory.Everything Worked like a charm.  Didn't even had to re-install windows it just worked.  I will reset windows just in case.Stock cooler is good.  I was playing cs go with an open case and my temps were 49-51 Celsius which is insanely cool.,"Cons:Fan a bit loud, but its not a big deal",Other Thoughts:Recommended this prdouct to few of my friends and they got it too.None of them any any issues so far.Good Job AMD and welcome back in the CPU world.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent processor,2018-10-04,Pros:I really like the speed this processor has.  The stock fan is quite enough for what I need.  I like the stock fan being RGB.  The whole thing works great with my Gigabtye X470 Aorus.  The CPU fan is very quiet.,Cons:Cons are required but not necessary with this product.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,1,"DON""T BUY ***READ***",2018-10-01,"Pros:Below is my original review, go to CON's.I'm running Ubuntu 18.04 and upgraded from an Intel i7-6700k. The Meltdown and Spectre patches killed my performance and became unbearable. This CPU with the Gigabyte X470 Auros Motherboard surpassed my expectations. The performance in spectacular. I use it for development and compiles/builds have noticeably improved.",Cons:AMD has introduced a performance penalty in their latest update to their AGESA 1.0.0.4 Microcode. This update decreases the multi-threaded performance of the CPU by more than 15%.I have been in contact with Gigabyte and they acknowledged the problem and w﻿ere able to reproduce the results as well. The performance decrease can be noticed using real world applications and synthetic benchmarks such as Passmark's PerformanceTest.Gigabyte said they would be contacting AMD about the issue.My guess at the moment is a variant of Spectre flaw was patched and has critically hindered the performance and AMD just silently didn't tell anyone.Be warned for anyone buying the Ryzen 7 2700x and getting the expected performance that has been reported in the past. This patch has hit the overall performance of the CPU.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,its ryzen 7 2700x!,2018-09-30,"Pros:RGB on the wraith prism cooler looks fancy and syncing well with motherboard RGBs with proper software.very strong multicore processing, it gets my video rendering work done really fast.for my 4k gaming experience along with vega 64 GPU, this ryzen 7 2700x does superb work with no bottleneck.for OCers the stock RGB cooler decent jobs cooling down the CPU and low fan noise, I would not spend money on aftermarket coolers for light overclocking on this CPU though.",Cons:none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Productivity Processor,2018-09-30,Pros:This is a very fast processor.  It is great for a mix of productivity and gaming performance.  Comes with a cooler that has optional RGB.,Cons:Limited PCIE lanes limits the number of M.2 NAND drives and high performance graphics cards that can be used.,"Other Thoughts:I replaced my i7 6800K with this. The two extra cores help with productivity and the higher based/turbo clocks make it great for games.  I thought about going with the best i7, but all the coolers excluding custom loop water, disinterested me and I did not want to spend the extra cash for it.I chose the X over the non-X to get higher clock frequencies for better gaming performance.  I have not overclocked this processor as it is fast enough for me without overclocking.  I need stability and this processor, even with the included cooler, is solid.I have not found out how to control the inner ring of the RGB on the cooler to keep it from color changing.  But it looks cool, so I stopped fiddling with it."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Pretty Awesome for 3D Modeling and Gaming,2018-09-30,Pros:Got to clock to 4.15Ghz across all cores at 1.2875V which is awesome for temperatures and productivity. Scoring an 1874 on cinebench was a good sight. It does anything and everything you could want without too much of a hiccup once you get it tuned in.,"Cons:The Voltages at stock are a little crazy if your board automatically applies an all core clock speed. I saw it fluctuate from .9~ish volts @2.8Ghz to 1.55v at 4.3Ghz, just from the stock settings with the board auto-applying the All Core Boost. This made my processor sit at roughly 80-85 Degrees C Tdie (90-95 C Tctl). That temperature was a tad uncomfortable for me and it climbed easily when the GPU was also pushing heavy loads. The only thing I wish is that in the future AMD makes sure that features which can cause an auto-overclock are disabled by default as some people may never check for this sort of thing.","Other Thoughts:I'd still recommend this over Intel if you want your computer to perform well in a variety of different tasks, such as: Gaming, Recording, 3D Modeling, Game Development, Video Editing, etc.With the Vega 64 Listed below, I've been getting 100-120fps (Locked at 120fps) on Fortnite at 1080p@Max, 65-75 FPS in Doom at 4k@Max, and am getting great performance in blender for modeling.System:Ryzen 2700xCooler: MA610Px470 TaichiG.

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Powerhouse!,2018-09-28,Pros:8 Core/16 Thread performance I barely reach 50% load during gaming/everyday tasks (gaming). I upgraded from an Intel i7 3770K which was decent for 1440p gaming though would bottleneck with 4K gaming. AMD 2700X Handles 4K like a champ with room to spare. I'm still troubleshooting clock and memory speeds. Currently workingat 4.3GHz @ 1.4+/-. Very pleased with where AMD is going and how they are tackling Intel. Healthy Competition is always welcomed.,Cons:Little headroom beyond 4.3GHz though considering this is an 8 core CPU that's understandable. AMD is still innovating! Pending Zen 3 @ 7nm.Stock cooler is adequate if you do not plan on overclocking anything. You can try to overclock on air though will see temps spike past your comfort zone. Cinebench on air would push me to 90-100+ Celsius and Idle temps would fluctuate between 60-70c. Now granted I did not use thermal paste. I used a thermal graphite pad. I'm currently using thermal paste with a custom water loop that has improved temps and clock speeds. You may have different results. Take mine experience with a grain of salt.,Other Thoughts:Current Rig:Ryzen 2700X X 43GHzAsus X470 Crosshair VII WifiCorsair 32GB GDDR4 3466MHz running at 3200MHz Stable2 x EVGA 1080 Hybris in SLICorsair HX1000iCorsair 570X RGB Crystal Case White
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Wow this thing is fast.,2018-09-27,Pros:Just use the wraith spire included with this CPU. I bought an AIO water cooler and quite frankly I wasted a lot of money on it. Just use the cooler the box has inside of it.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Would have been nice to have some detailed instructions on how to install this entire thing. At least include a how to.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD is back,2018-09-26,"Pros:FAST. Don't let the benchmark hardcore geeks fool you, this chip from AMD put them back into the game big time. If you are a hardcore custom building OC'ing ultra computer nerd, then you are likely going to find more hobby potential somewhere else. If you are everyone else, gamer, graphics design, whatever, then this is the chip for you. AMD's own fancy little algorithm does an amazing job of optimizing power use and boost clock performance without having to touch anything. It's plug and play speed.","Cons:None? I have heard these chips run hot, but i built my rig with a liquid cool set up from the get go so i couldn't say. The included air cooler is huge and fancy and looks like a part from a space shuttle or something, so odds are even if it runs hot AMD has you covered with that thing. I went liquid because I have in the past and IMO more stable temps also means more life and less fan noise. Especially the fan noise part.","Other Thoughts:Now is the time to give AMD a shot. This chip is bonkers. I picked up a Vega 64 GPU to go with it, a lot because of price but also because the (hard to find) unbiased reviews gave it very high marks on par if not exceeding the 1080's. I hope AMD can design a GPU to put Nvidea on it's heels like they did to Intel with chip.I put this into a new rig using ASRock's Taichi mobo. What a brilliant combo it has been so far."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great product.,2018-09-23,Pros:Excellent processor. No regrets.Fast and secure shipping.,Cons:Nothing.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Nice Processor,2018-09-18,"Pros:Fast, upgraded from FX8350, which was fine, but this is fast. To be fair I did change to a M.2 SS harddrive, I'm sure that made a difference also. But I am happy, nice stock cooling to go with it, normal temps about 53 C.",Cons:No con that I can see.,"Other Thoughts:Would recommend, AMD is doing a fine job!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Great chip,2018-09-17,"Pros:Ryzen pros should be well known. Its 8 core 16 thread, I don't see CPU usage above 60% in gaming leaving plenty of CPU for streaming, background tasks etcChip install is a bit less touchy than Intel on the socket- just be REALLY careful with the chip itself. Do. Not. Drop. lolThe Wraith Prism cooler is legit beautiful and does a decent job cooling if you cant afford an aftermarket solution right now.","Cons:Maybe I just got a bad chip, but mine runs hot. I idle at around 60c and max at 85-90 on air cooling and 77-80 on an AIO. It idles at 60c no matter what. I may RMA the chip for this reason. On air, my clock speeds also dial WAY back- down to 3.6 or 3.7 under full load.Overclocking is pointless, and confusing. there are so many different ways to do it, the MB, Ryzen master, Asus AI suite 3- I don't know how these different things interact and am not comfortable with it. I just want one way to overclock.Warranty is dumb. Ryzen voids your warranty for just about anything- they give you xfr2 and then tell you it voids your warranty to use it. xfr2 doest do anything for my chip anyway btw.","Other Thoughts:I am liking the chip in general, but I did seem to have gotten a bad one which is unfortunate."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Worked on first POST,2018-09-13,Pros:Worked. Temps are okay. I ordered better thermal compound to see if that makes a difference.,"Cons:I wanted to get the Prism cooler, but didn't want the higher power consumption. I now find the Prism is not available, and am now looking at water cooling.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this cpu. I have had nothing but good experiences so far. I liked the lower power consumption compared to the 2700X. The performance delta is small.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,OK... But,2018-09-09,"Pros:It does everything it says, no complaints there,","Cons:Ok, seriously with this packaging? I mean come one! I bought a specific model that is specific to one socket, why do you give me install instruction for installing on an AM2 board???","Other Thoughts:Well, it does do all the things you already read. BUT. When you have to install it, just start guessing about the fan, Nothing about it in the instructions. So maybe this will help someone... There are 2 covered ports, one for USB and one for RGB. If you have that RGB connection then you are good to go, don't worry about the USB one. Also, put the AMD logo in the top left corner on the fan, that seems to be the best orientation (no instructions). One side note: The RGB on the fan seems to be addressable with MLB software, except for the one ring right around the fan... it has a mind of it's own.***EDIT*** Ok you can control that ring of light with Cooler Master software (undocumented) and if you plug in the USB (undocumented). Not changing my 4 Egg review, this stuff should be explained in a manual. Loving the speed of this thing!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,great cpu!,2018-09-06,Pros:Haven’t had any issues what so ever.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:Some how mine came already over clocked to 4.3? XD
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best CPU for price,2018-09-06,"Pros:The Ryzen CPUs are truly great for the price. An 8 core, 16 thread CPU that runs fine with stock cooler. Some people say this CPU isn't good for gaming, but they are more than enough. I game at 1440p 60fps+ on the smaller CPUs (Ryzen 1600) and haven't experienced any CPU bottleneck in *any* game. These are also very good for video editing.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Better than Intel,2018-09-05,"Pros:Run perfect at stock frequency with its stock cooler, not hotter than 75C in encoding.",Cons:AMD should use a better thermal compound on the cooler.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Finally over a week later,2018-09-04,"Pros:Power .... and what a lot of it, pus the CPU cooler added with it is an amazing perk",Cons:I'll let you know if I find one,"Other Thoughts:.... my suggestion is pay for the extra shipping, to expensive a part for it to be late and be in another province.Shipped on Monday and was available for pick up the following Tuesday, for a destination that should have take 2 days max.I would remove an egg for the 8 day hassle to get it but that would not reflect the product nor Newegg but Canada Post which is not the item being reviewed."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,1,Great product I'm sure...if it worked.,2018-09-03,"Pros:No Pros for me. The mobo an error code of ""8"" right out of the box. Not ""08""...""8"". I did look the error code up but at this point I don't recall what it meant. And it doesn't matter, I now purchased Intel based parts as I should have from the get go.",Cons:Didn't work.,"Other Thoughts:Bought this in a combo. Combo #3821024. This also included AMD RYZEN 7 2700X 8-Core 3.7 GHz (4.3 GHz Max Boost) Socket AM4 105W YD270XBGAFBOX Desktop Processor and G.SKILL TridentZ RGB Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 3200 (PC4 25600) Desktop Memory. The memory for this combo was incorrect and was not for AMD. The AMD part number should have an ""X"" at the very end (F4-3200C14D-16GTZR ""X"") but I was sent (F4-3200C14D-16GTZR). This is clearly stated on the G.SKill website and when picking parts on pcpartpicker.com they had the incorrect part as well. Luckily the dude I spoke with who helped me return this put in a ticket to change the incorrect RAM part after he checked it while I was on the phone with him. Hopefully they have the combo with the correct TridentZ RAM with Ryzen CPU's now. Well, I attempted to go with AMD for the very first time and it didn't work out. So, after receiving my refund I came back to Newegg and purchased Intel based parts. I'll only be paying about $50 more for Intel parts that have worked for me for years and years. I'll stick with Intel from this point on for sure! Sorry AMD."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Nice Cpu,2018-09-01,Pros:Runs Really Fast.Fits Perfect In Asus Prime X470 Pro MV,Cons:Stock Cooler Runs LoudOverDrive Makes Voltages Wacked,Other Thoughts:Turn Overdrive off and just keep it at stock speed and shes a the best cpu ever
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Does work with Win7 without a new OS install. It's easy, see other and you will see how easy it is",2018-09-01,"Pros:Upgraded from 8320 overclocked to 3.8ghz.  There is a huge increase in games like Civ 5, the Last Remnant, and even newer games.  Geometry Wars and Chicken Invaders at 4k is finally possible, and also in some newer games like Nier, but some settings have to be turned down. 1440 resolutions don't bother this processor.  Very happy with the upgrayedd.  Two D's for a double dose of that P1MP1N","Cons:Not sure if it's because of my mobo, but my system uses more power than my old one.  My electricity bill is way higher.","Other Thoughts:--This is copy paste from my MSI x470 review--If you want to run Win 7 on here, without jumping through hoops, I will guide you through a simple process that takes about 3-5 min. You don't have do make a new disc, usb install, or anythang else. Even though you should probably do a fresh install since this is new hardware, you don't have to. I've been using this same SSD (Samsung 840 Pro) for years and haven't reinstalled Win on it in several years. You can use the same install you are probably reading this on, and you don't have to buy a new keyboard, I will tell you how to login without one. I installed Win 10 on my  970 Pro, and hate it, even though I installed the classic shell UI, spybot beacon, and turned off as much annoying and useless stuff as I can. (I can't even overlock my monitor with Win 10, like I could with Win 7).DO THESE STEPS BEFORE YOU INSTALL YOUR NEW HARDWARE, MEANING THE SYSTEM YOU ARE PROBABLY USING NOW. This is NOT for new installs1) On the system you will use Win 7 on, go to the MSI website (or whatever mobo you are using) and download the USB drivers, along with Lan drivers, then extract them. Select the Win 7 x64 or x86, whichever you use. Should be under the other tab. Put them in a folder where you can easily remember them.2) Do not buy any keyboard usb/ps2 adapters, most will not work. You will use the same keyboard you have been using, unless you just want to buy a new keyboard. You will need an old school ps2 mouse, IT IS necessary, but you can buy one from Newegg for very cheap, and if you don't like it, you can return it after you finish, but I keep mine just in case something happens down the road. Go with name brand like Logitech or Microsoft. Make sure your mobo has a ps2 mouse port, the MSI mobo I use has one. Do not buy a ps2/ USB adapter for a keyboard or mouse. You are wasting time and money. I did that, and it did not work. You have to have a working mouse, and ps2 mouses will work best. After you follow these steps, and get your system up and running, then you can start using your regular usb mouse. Got it!?NOW, INSTALL YOUR NEW HARDWARE (x470 + RYZEN+CURRENT WIN 7 HARD DRIVE/SSD) AND BOOT INTO YOUR ALREADY WORKING WIN 7 OPERATING SYSTEM1) Once you get to the Win 7 login screen, if you have a working ps2 mouse, you will notice the mouse works, but the keyboard doesn't. It's natural, but make sure your keyboard is still connected.2) At the login screen, on the very bottom left of the screen, you will see an icon, it's an ease of access icon. Click on that, and many options will show up. The 3rd or 4th choice will give you an option for an on screen keyboard. Click that option, and now you have an on screen keyboard so you can login. Make sure you mouse click on the password part after the keyboard pops up, and you will use your mouse to click on your letters and numbers, but your physical keyboard still will not work. Before you even buy your hardware, next time you go to login, check to make sure this option is available. I had been using Win 7 for seven years and just recently found out this option even existed.  I had my new hardware laying around my house for 2 months before I figured this out lol.3) Go to the folder where you have your extracted usb drivers. You really should have download all of them, even the ethernet, chipset, etc. Ethernet is also important, because if you forgot to download something, now you can connect to the internet.4) Go to control panel, and select device manager. You will right click on properties, and update the drivers this way. Update drivers by ""Browse my computer for software."" Select the location you have your mobo drivers downloaded to (Manually).5) You will update the following individually: Keyboards, mice and other deivces, other devices, system devices, and Universal serial bus controllers.CLICK ON THEM, AND MAKE THE TREE SHOW, AND UPDATE THEM EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A YELLOW EXCLAMATION POINT. Don't just update the ones that give you the warning. Many of the drivers will show working, but they aren't, they need to be updated. You went this far, now don't be lazy. I don't remember if it was the Universal serial bus controllers or keyboard, but once I updated this, my keyboard started illuminating again, and the buttons started working again.  I could finally use my keyboard again. Using this method, I could still use the same OS i've been using for the past several years, and I didn't lose any files or software in the process.  After I logged in it took about 5 min to do all of them.You are welcomeRyzen 2700x (stock speed)MSI x470 m7Noctua NH-D15 SE-AM4G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series DDR4 3600, 32GB (2 x 16GB)Gtx 980tiSamsung 970 Pro 1tb Win 10Samsung 850 Pro 512 gbSamsung 840 Pro 512gb Win 7Samsung 860 Evo 1tbSeaSonic X Series X650 GoldCrucial M4 512gbCorsair case 650 (d or t)"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,3,Really hot,2018-08-31,"Pros:-Does the job, it's fast when it needs too",Cons:-Chip runs really hot-Provided cooler is subpar,Other Thoughts:I don't know maybe I just got a really hot chip. Remove the non essential features...like the LED and lower the price.

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fast :],2018-08-30,"Pros:Pros: Fast and reliable. A HUGE upgrade to my old AMD FX 8350. This cpu has zero issue handling games.  Paired with an x470 rbg mobo, the Wraith Prism cooler with even more RGB and TridentZ RGB DD4 ram, I can finally say that my system is complete. Had no trouble updating the BIOS, and had no trouble installing newer drivers.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:YAS! :D Great CPU!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Loving this processor!,2018-08-29,"Pros:Reasonably priced, great cooler, I haven't tried overclocking not sure if I will.  This thing is a speed Demon.",Cons:Well I just wish AMD kept updating their graphics cards as well,Other Thoughts:Would definately recommend this processor to anyone who wants a great product at a reasonable price
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Nooiiice,2018-08-29,Pros:-It's fast and works great!,Cons:-null,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Unbeatable bang for the buck,2018-08-28,Pros:- 8 cores / 16 Threads- Always boosting to 4 GHz or higher- Good in games- Great for stuff like video editing,Cons:- None so far,Other Thoughts:Wanted an affordable good processor for games and work (Read: Not a Threadripper).Satisfied.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,I have yet to max this out,2018-08-27,"Pros:Fast, more cores than I could ever need, great price/performance ratio.  I use this for GIS, Excel, web surfing (all at the same time) and games like World of Tank/World of Warships and I have yet to max out cores or speed.  The included cooler is pretty darn good.  Saved $40+ there.",Cons:None yet.,Other Thoughts:The included cooler pushed this over for me from buying an Intel to the 2700x.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Rising,2018-08-23,Pros:I've been AMD for a hot minute now. I recently upgraded from the FX-8350 bringing up the question: to intel or not to intel?AMD it is.Fan looks cool.Much snappier than the FX series. If it wasn't I'd be pretty upset.,"Cons:-Stock cooler is louder than my ""be quiet!"".",Other Thoughts:I'm impressed enough to continue with AMD in the future.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Great cpu,2018-08-23,"Pros:Fast, not as fast as the x version, but faster than the fx series","Cons:Is not friendly to windows 7, and most RAM, a lot of head aches matching up the right set up. Website says it can take ddr4 3000, but it does not. DO YOUR RESEARCH!","Other Thoughts:AMD no longer supports Win 7, be warned."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD for Life,2018-08-21,"Pros:I been with AMD for many years, My first build was a K6 2 500 overclocked to 550 on Windows 95, Every build since then was AMD but this is by far the fastest and most stable to date. Great heat dissipation by the stock cooler. Handles everything I throw at it.",Cons:If installing on a B350 chipset BIOS flash will be necessary.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Loving the Zen+ Platform!,2018-08-21,"Pros:Running without a manual OC on the stock cooler, I'm getting boosts up to 4.2ghz. Gaming temps average at 51c, with the occasional odd spike to the low 60s that lasts a second or two. Great gaming performance so far! It's pushing the frames that I'd expect when paired with the 1080ti.The included Wraith Prism looks great using the RGB header as it syncs with the board, but I understand the using the USB header will produce different effects controlled by the AMD/Cooler Master software.With some juggling of the fan curves, the stock cooler doesn't ramp up too loudly and keeps everything cool and quiet.","Cons:I've not built an AMD system in many years and I forgot how much of a pain the stock bracket can be for the cooler. I eventually got it after smearing paste all over the IHS, but nothing appears to be damaged. It's not ""hard"" to install, just not intuitive as there are very few instructions on exactly how to get the mount to clip.","Other Thoughts:Besides the stock cooler being a little bit of a pain to install, everything is working well. This is playing well with 32gb of DDR4 at 3000mhz.The boost seems to work oddly at idle; it ramps up/down clock/voltage when literally nothing is happening, but seems to perform more steadily under load (gaming). I was concerned that I was pushing 1.4v under the auto OC, but it turns out this is normal per AMD.Typical temps are in the low 50c's while gaming with an average voltage closer to 1.3v pushing 4.1ghz-4.2ghz. I've turned off the precision boost and it stays at a constant 3.7ghz with little to no fluctuating voltage, but since the other operation is normal, precision boost stays on as it pushes a few more FPS that way.There is zero documentation for the stock cooler in regards to it's hi/low switch OR the USB and RGB cables. My switch is set to low, which I can only assume sets the max RPM, and things are OK. I've read that the RGB cable will sync to your board's RGB software, while the USB cable will enable use of the Cooler Master RGB software w/ different effects. I've only tried the RGB cable and it works well with MSI Mystic Light. It syncs to the RAM/Board LEDs, but I can't independently control the ring colors on the cooler. The USB cable is needed for that w/ the other software, but only one cable should be used at a time as the RGB cable will override the USB cable if they're both plugged in.Set a custom curve for you fans. Ramp up the intake and exhaust a little to provide cool fresh air, and the stock CPU cooler shouldn't fluctuate much. I'm using a Meshify C with two 140mm up front and a 120mm in the back. 75% case fan speed is enough to keep the stock cooler quiet, while keeping temps more than reasonable."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Unbelievable,2018-08-20,Pros:This is such a great processor AMD has really stepped it up again giving Intel a run for their money I have never owned an Intel processor and I never will. for being at the top of the line consumer model of CPUs to come with a top-of-the-line air cooler with RGB lighting and three zones of control the air cooler has been tested Buy testors on YouTube to compete very closely with AIO water coolers it's rated at 3.7 gig but it runs out of the box steady at 4.0 with no overclocking on all 8 cores comes with two cables for two different ways to control the RGB lighting depending on your setup you're going to want to search online as they do not give you proper instructions but there are some great videos on YouTube that explain the wiring setup.,Cons:basically there are no cons just a couple small issues there are no clear instructions on how to set up the two cables to the CPU fan for the lighting control one as USB and one is RGB I had to do a lot of research there is a great video on YouTube that explains which one to use in which situations and secondly based on that I wish there was a way that you didn't have to use the USB header on the motherboard for full RGB control with the AMD software you download from CoolerMaster.,Other Thoughts:Another home run from AMD paired with the proper motherboard X470 and memory you can have you a great system basically a top-of-the-line system and for what you get you can not spend too much money and doing it compared to other setups that you could get from other manufacturers I would recommend you pair this with the Asus ROG Crosshair VII Wi-Fi version and Corsair vengeance RGB Pro memory that's my setup and it works great.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Its amazing,2018-08-20,Pros:-Lots of cores-3D Modeling work in Blender is super smooth-Running an AMD processor feels good-Great price point,Cons:Should I have waited for Ryzen 2?,None

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great value for price,2018-08-16,Pros:The stock cooler looks amazing. Performance though is just okay. It just looks too good thoughGreat overclocker. 8 Cores 16 Threads. Game and stream without a problemCompared to the R7 1700 that this is replacing I am seeing some nice increase in performance.,"Cons:Ryzen Master is bugged on ultrawide 1440p monitor. Very blurry software. It is okay though you can overclock via BIOS.Some issue with Corsair software when reading temperature. Due to AMD's offset on the 2700X and basically any of their Ryzen X CPU. (most issues seem to be software, almost no cons with the hardware).Stock voltage seems a little worrisome. (May be my motherboard default settings though. I did end up turning it down)","Other Thoughts:If you can find this on sale, it is a no brainer. Until Intel's new 9000 series comes out this is the king of gaming + streaming. Works great for editing and encoding videos as well."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great CPU no matter which brand you love.,2018-08-16,"Pros:-decent temps under load-standard installation easy as pie-best AMD gaming CPU you can get on any budget (Not counting TR series as they are not for gaming, plus this works better in most cases anyway)-Excellent for streaming while gaming, nearly as good as having two systems in OBS, nearly-value is excellent with included cooling solution that actually looks cool and works","Cons:-still slower then 8700k in single threaded applications-though good value, still expensive-AMD/Coolermaster cooler had issues setting up RGB. USB headers on my Crosshair hero didn't want to detect the cooler.-on max speed the cooler is quite loud (not a big deal since it never seems to get there unless you bully it quite a bit)","Other Thoughts:Overall this CPU performs exactly as I expected it too. I have an 8700k in my other PC and by comparison they compete on pretty level ground. At 1440p, which is my preferred resolution, both systems trade blows in most games. Very little to separate them. Only at 1080p does the Intel pull away and not by much. AMD is having a good year and this CPU is proof of that. Have to give this CPU a solid recommendation for gamers, streamers, workstations and general users. If you only game and want the best, I have to say the 8700k is a better CPU, but since it lacks a cooler the 2700x is a good second choice. If you want a jack of all trades this CPU is fantastic."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,So far so good,2018-08-15,Pros:- Fast- Heat sink is pretty,Cons:- Runs a little hot with the stock cooler getting about 73C  under cpu stress test.,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from a 1st Gen I5 to this beast. For the cost I can't complain. It gets me the desired functionality and allows me to work and play with extreme speeds.  It does run a little warm but I'm using the stock cooler with liquid metal thermal compound, with that said I idle around 50C and under full load I'm hitting at most 73 C.  I just can't complain."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,RYZEN 7 8 Core/ 12 Thread,2018-08-13,Pros:It's the new generation of RYZEN 7. It's an animal...I had a 6 core/ 12 thread Intel 5930k. This processor smokes it anyday. Very impressed with AMD right now.,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:The LED Wraithspire Cooler is a nice touch, looks amazing in the case. I would definitely recommend."

AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-08-06,"Pros:Fast, cost efficient",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Good for many needs,2018-08-04,Pros:8 cores without breaking the bank,Cons:I can't find a true con,Other Thoughts:My review is biased. I upgraded from an Ivy Bridge i7 running Linux which was being used solely for Android Development. I expected doubling up the cores to noticably speed up the dev workflow. It does not. Going fron 2 > 4 cores was a big boost. going SATA3 > PCIE SSD was a big boost. Going Ryzen 7 meant less responsiveness & mild regressions. Quad-core is enough.This will be great for devs running a lot of VM ot docker containers. Not much help for Android
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Second AMD processor I ever owned,2018-08-03,Pros:-Cool Box-RGB Heatsink-Neat case badge,Cons:-Mounting system is dated and was a pain to install,Other Thoughts:Installed this on a x470 ASUS ROG motherboard with no issues. When gaming I touched 63-65C with monitoring from Ryzen Master software. I am waiting for my AM4 kit to arrive for my H80i GT liquid cooler as I am not a fan of stock heatsinks. No instability whatsoever to report with a full days testing. 8 cores and 16 threads is plenty for me to grow into. Highly recommend this processor but just know you need a AM4 motherboard and a X470 chipset that is optimized for Ryzen 2. I cannot speak for X370.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Duuuude, You're Getting a Ryzen",2018-08-02,"Pros:- Posted without issues as some others have mentioned (installed on an ASUS Prime x470-Pro).- Overclocks, and then overclocks some more. For those less inclined to configure your OC settings in the BIOS, it pretty much overclocks itself with very little effort. I still recommend getting a mobo with decent OC support in order to squeeze even more out of this beast. CPUz benchmarks scored above average out of the box, so I'm very happy with the chip I received.- Running 2x 8gb G.Skill TridentZ RGB at 3600mhz and tighter timings than advertised. This says more about the RAM and motherboard, but the 2700x is able to remain stable while overclocked even with my out-of-spec RAM timings.",Cons:- Doesn't float?,"Other Thoughts:- I needed to update my BIOS to get rid of some very slight stuttering I noticed on the first boot. I knew that I needed to update the BIOS to get the best functionality, just mentioning this for others. The platform is still new-ish, and performance will continue to increase as it matures and motherboard manufacturers update their products. If you're purchasing a new motherboard to support this CPU, it would probably be wise to go with a brand that regularly issues BIOS fixes/updates for the near future.- The included heatsink's (AMD Wraith Prism) LED lighting isn't my cup of tea, but it's really just an optional feature. The heatsink is a bit wide vs. tall, and it is worth noting that it might make some setups cramped. No complaints here, as it was awesome to receive an aftermarket-level heatsink along with the CPU."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best for the price,2018-08-01,"Pros:140+ fps gaming! Easy to stream w/ without lagging or stutter. I'm impressed with the stock cooler, it can handle most tasks with quiet fan speeds.",Cons:none,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,"It's a small, gray square that does magic",2018-07-30,Pros:It processes things quickly.It processes a lot of things at once even faster.What can I say? It's a processor.,"Cons:Single core performance benches only slightly better (in my setup) than that of my old FX-8350, and it's inconsistent between runs.It seems to really struggle with virtual machines, even more than my old processor, and my old-old Phenom II X4!","Other Thoughts:I only took one egg off even with the cons listed because I can't imagine that all my issues are caused by the processor. My Motherboard (ASRock Fatal1ty X470 Gaming K4) is a very strange animal, and I may be able to blame it for some of this.If you're curious, take a look at my review of it.Also, the included RGB fan is nice."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Not as good as 1800X,2018-07-29,"Pros:1. Easy to overclock. Running stable at 4.1GHz without adjusting the core voltage (did not try more).2. Slightly faster than 1800X in photo processing, but not a must.","Cons:1. This CPU forced me to switch from Win7 to Win10 for missing the USB3.1 drivers. While I am not ready for Win10 yet (though evaluated for several times).2. The CPU stopped working the next morning without any reason, burned out? This never happened before.3. The core temperature reached 80s degree C in processing a photo at 4.1GHz.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this Ryzen 7 2700 to couple with MSI B350 motherboard. I doubt about the quality of the Zen+ or it might require a more powerful cooler (mine is Corsair H55 liquid cooler with double fans).The Ryzen 7 1800X is the best one that I can stay with Win7. I may buy another 1800X or wait for Zen2.But still, I give five stars to AMD processors."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Incredible CPU,2018-07-28,Pros:Fast?  I can't begin to say how fast this is.  Makes everything run smooth as silk. If you have the $$ this would be the cpu to get.,Cons:Nothing but a bit pricey.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,2,A-M-D-isaster,2018-07-27,"Pros:first AMD, haven't use it long enough to see any benefits over my previous pc","Cons:Runs HOT!!! idle temps 40C-55C(hot for intel guy like me) ran prime 95 and temps jump to 86C. The idle temps alone worried me, then noticed temps were spiking 40C-65C just  browsing the web. Read the forums for help, people say its normal, been Intel guy all my life so this was not normal to me, also cpu voltages are spiking 1.125v to 1.45v plus the fans throttle up and down from max to normal back to max and was annoying as heck, tried fan curve no luck cant tune it out. The temps were high but safe temps it seems but needed to fix the fan throttling problem.  IF you have temp problems with this CPU listen up...Solved my problem.  Noticed it was boosting to 4.3ghz alot but got my attention when it was boosting just to move the MOUSE, WT F?  the cpu would boost to max if you did anything, background programs also caused it to boost which was why it kept boosting up and down every other second.  AMD Fail is all i gotta say, not saying it sucks, the fan boys are hating on me now :) but out of the box it has lots of problems. So went back to bios decided to try disabling the cpu boost, ""problem solved"".  cpu clocks stay at stock 3.7ghz it'll still down boost but not boost up if that makes any sense, so no more temp spikes. Idle temps are now 30C at idle and normal use like typing an essay or browsing the web dont cause temp spike anymore still at 30C, playing games on steam, temps stabilized at 38c-40c. Rerun prime95 max temps 68C stabilized. Opening web browser or moving the mouse don't cause temp spikes any more.Now that's normal for me.","Other Thoughts:So far not worth the switch to AMD should've stayed with intel. People were raving about how good it is but i don't do rendering or anything that could maximized on the 8 cores so cant test that. Primary use is normal home stuff like typing, movies, internet browsing and some games so not seeing the benefit there. If your thinking of getting your first AMD cpu and you only use it for normal stuff, don't get it, you have to pay attention to what is compatible and whats not. Sometimes they say its compatible and its still not.  AMD cpu are backwards compatible with previous gen motherboards but this can cause some serious headaches as it sometime require a skilled person to tweak the bios.  knew this before buying and still had major problems with this build, not going to bore you with the details, but bought a motherboard with this cpu that others had said was ""plug and play out of the box"" well not so much."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,No problems so far,2018-07-23,Pros:-Great speeds-Stable-Should keep you within acceptable performance levels for quite some time.,"Cons:-Had a problem installing the stock cooler. The latches were about 2-3mm too short to attach to the board retention brackets. What should have taken me 2 minutes tops took about half an hour. I was concerned the paste was botched at this point and will be monitoring temps like a hawk. So far according to hwmonitor it idles at 40-45c , plays at 55-65c, and peaks at 70c. CPU-Z stress test for a minute and half capped it out at 78c. Worst case scenario I switch out the coolers but since I'm not planning to OC this seems to be about expected from what I've read and before any throttling. Mobo was Asrock x470 K4 for reference.",Other Thoughts:-I'll definitely be recommending the Ryzen series CPUs to anyone. 2600x was my first option but I got this on a sale that matched my original budget so I figured why not.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Good CPU,2018-07-22,Pros:- It's the top of the line CPU before the Thread Rippah.,Cons:- Probably could have bought a Ryzen 7 1700/1700x/1800x and lose 10% performance and save 50-100 dollars.,"Other Thoughts:It's not the best value, unless you find this on sale. The included CPU cooler is very good and if you actually don't have a CPU cooler than this is a very good deal."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,I definitely got a good one,2018-07-20,Pros:FastStable (at standard clocks)Very reasonably priced for the performance vs other brand CPUs,Cons:No cheaper option to buy it without the air cooler,"Other Thoughts:Already had a Ryzen 7 1700.  This dipped price-wise below my ""I'll buy it when it hits this price"" cost threshold.  Was not disappointed.  Updated the mobo UEFI BIOS as required, uninstalled the 1700 and installed the 2700X.  Ran it for a couple days to let thermal paste set.  When I ran the benchmarks, the CPU scored about 2.5% higher than the world average at standard clocks on my ASRock X370 Taichi and with a Samsung 970 EVO 250GB NVMe 2280 M.2 SSD as the OS/boot disk.This CPU line is why I stick with AMD for custom builds.  Best bang for the buck."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best consumer-grade workstation processor on the market.,2018-07-16,"Pros:With stock settings on a x470 Taichi I get 15% more performance than a stock 1800x and 10% more than a stock 8700k. You need fast ram to achieve this (Samsung B Die). Also, I gained 10% more performance by tightening my secondary ram timings. My primary timings are still at 3200 14-14-14, and by only tweaking the secondary ones using Ryzen Timing Calculator I was able to get a significant CPU performance boost! No need to overclock this baby, xfr2 is awesome!",Cons:Absolutely none. Best purchase I have ever made.,"Other Thoughts:Don't buy this with slow ram. Get Samsung B Die at 3200 14-14-14 minimum or you won't get the most out of your investment. I know the RAM prices are crazy right now, but trust me... it makes a big difference. This processor will tear through anything.I am a music producer. With this thing, I can run massive 30-track orchestral projects with zero latency and live-record on top without any underruns! It's a dream come true!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Good Upgrade,2018-07-15,Pros:Fast.  Responsive.,Cons:Not sure.,Other Thoughts:Didn't notice much of an upgrade over my fx-8350 at 4.6 GHz.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best General CPU of 2018,2018-07-14,"Pros:8-Cores = fast performance when I'm multitasking, with multiple things all open/running in Win10Very good gaming performance too!Great top of the line CPU Air Cooler included!",Cons:AMD Ryzen Master software kept putting the CPU into single-core/gaming performance mode but it eventually saved my setting correctly to Creator Mode.,Other Thoughts:Buy a GOOD x470 motherboard for this.  I bought the ASRock Tachi and had zero regrets.  The ASUS ROG Cross VII was my alternative on my NewEgg wishlist.  The Wraith cooler was redundant for my build (I have a 280mm water-cooled radiator in my case) and I resold it in two hours on <name redacted> for $50

Its fast and efficient..Great for multitasking .This CPU will do it all..I also have the Ryzen 5 1600..Its a great CPU as well..BEWARE, THIS CPU DOES NOT HAVE iGPU..So, u will need a dedicated GPU.."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,I am glad I purchased this processor!,2018-07-09,"Pros:Easy to installLove the colors on the CPU fanQuiet, faster compared to previous FX-8350Lives up to the hypePrice to performance is great",Cons:None to me,Other Thoughts:Bought as a combo with AsRock TaiChi Ultimate MB. Both installed flawlessly. Running Windows 10 Pro with 16GB of AdataXPG Gammix D10 DDR4 3000.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best CPU for $300,2018-07-09,"Pros:- Full 8c/16t- Incredibly fast- Soldered IHS- The included heat-sink performs great, so long as you're not overclocking, and is much better than previous stock heat-sinks from AMD or Intel.","Cons:- Not the best overclocker, don't expect to go above 4.3GHz without some crazy voltage(and cooling). Even then, the processor performs incredibly at the frequencies it hits.","Other Thoughts:Upgraded from an FX-6300, and I'm incredibly happy, and impressed, with the 2700(I have mine OC'd to 4.0GHZ, @1.35v with a Noctua NH-U12S)Great for Streaming/Recording/Encoding/Gaming/anything you throw at it.10/10 would buy again."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent processor,2018-07-08,"Pros:I haven't bought an AMD chip since the Phenom II X4 965 Black way back when... And the reason for that is because the FX successor chips were NOT very good... Really the only good thing about the FX chip was the cheap price...Anyway I digress...I was really skeptical about buying this chip because of the FX series, but AMD really did a fantastic job with the Ryzen processor and it definitely exceeded my expectations, I bought this for a gaming rig and I choose this processor over the i7-8700k for quite a few reasons...- The price. It's about 50 dollars cheaper.- It has 8-cores, and 16 threads. Can you find another processor that has that?- Stock cooler is amazing. It looks beautiful and complimented my Thermaltake View 71 perfectly and it was extremely easy to install on AM4 mobo. I literally placed the CPU in, locked it in place and my board already had the bracket installed I simply snapped it on with the hooks on the cooler and it went on very secure. Oh and not to mention AMD applied liberal thermal paste to the cooler. The i7-8700k doesn't have a cooler, you have to buy. By the time you buy the processor and a good cooler your already at 400+ or maybe 500 dollars if you plan on doing extreme over clocking.- Temps are pretty low at base clocks... Idle around 35-40, when gaming it maxed out at 51c, I even stressed the game with Kingdom Come which is extremely CPU heavy because of Cry Engine , I was getting 60fps at Vhigh Settings with High Def graphics mod enabled @ 1920x1080 with Sapphire Nitro+ RX580. The only thing bottlenecking me with this game is that I don't have a Solid State... (Yet)- I messed around with my asus auto tuning settings, and it OCed the chip about 14% and the temps maxed out at around 70c on a stress test which isn't bad, I have not attempted manual OC and probably won't until I have a better cooler.- Loads windows/apps very fast.I would def recommend this chip to anyone. I think AMD has learned their lesson with their FX chips and is definitely looking to repair their reputation... Which for me, they absolutely have. If you have any reservations or still feel cautious about purchasing AMD's new chips because of previous bad experiences with FX line - you can lay those thoughts to rest.AMD is back.",Cons:- I heard over clocking this thing was a pain in the wazoo.- Not as good as the i7-8700k.,"Other Thoughts:If you plan on using the stock cooler like me, buy a see through case! I got my case loaded down with 8 Thermaltake riing 12 series blue fans, the AMD stock cooler, and my Asus ROG Strix x470-F lights up beautifully!! Looks like Christmas in there!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great gaming CPU,2018-07-07,Pros:FastStableCost effective,Cons:Wish its clock speed per core was higher or overclocked better.  Be careful when buying memory for this as this chip benefits greatly from higher clocked ram.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Crazy Fast 4.325ghz all cores!,2018-07-07,Pros:My chip runs 4.325ghz on all cores @ 1.35 on MSI x470 M7 AC boardIve seen it self boost to 4.6ghz before my manual overclock (Not on all cores)Stays cool max ive seen with stated overclock is 67C with Thermaltake Water 3.0 Extreme S (This is stress testing it)Beats my I7-4770k @4.3ghz in games like Farcry5 same GTX 1080 (I7 4770k - 70-80 FPS)  (Ryzen 2700x - 100-125fps)Older games they get around the same FPS,Cons:None I might have hit the silicon lottery for once! 4.325 @ 1.35 volts and didn't try any higher. I might push it higher down the road when its towards the end of its life like I did my I7-4770k which I lost  the lottery on lol.,"Other Thoughts:If you want the max FPS right now then go with a Intel I7-8700k and OC it to 5ghz.  The only reason to choose Intel now.If you want to upgrade you CPU 2 years down the road pick AMD!If you want to get more threads/ total CPU power for your money Pick AMD!If you don't want to have to delid you CPU Pick AMD.The core wars have begun and newer games can actually use these threads, and they will continue to be threaded higher and higher to keep the first gen Xbox ones and PS4s running the newer games. So most games will be using 8 threads soon. Ive seen Farcry 5 use all 8 threads of my I7-4770k at 80-95% so yea they use the threads but it you can give it 8 real cores you going to gain some great fps just like I did!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,What A Piece of Work!,2018-07-04,"Pros:This thing is fast and responsive. And, considering it's relatively new, I had some reservations about using it since I wanted to switch to Linux, but the OS and 2700x are working perfectly together and my system is snappy and responsible.",Cons:There are none.,Other Thoughts:Would absolutely recommend. 10/10
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,OWNS EVERYTHING I THROW AT IT,2018-07-02,"Pros:Upgraded from a AMD FX-6300 and let me tell you just within 3 hours of use I noticed everthing was so much better, programs load fast and fps in games is almost doubled. Im still on the same GTX 960SC and it is a great card but just upgrading to this gives me solid 60FPS at 1080p. Games like Conan Exiles, 7DTD, The Division, BF1, Escape from Tarkov, etc.",Cons:- No RGB on the Processor itself...,Other Thoughts:(Yes that con was a joke)
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,A Nice improvement over My 1700X,2018-07-01,Pros:Plays games better and my grandson says it renders his videos much faster than the already fast 1700X.Ryzen Master software is much improved for general tweaking and overclockingIt's very good for gaming and superb for content creation.Great price and value!  Intel is nowhere close.,"Cons:They won't let me submit without a con.  So, I guess it could always be less expensive.  Maybe free?...LOL",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this CPU to anyone.I bought another one for my grandson's build
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Works well,2018-06-30,Pros:I've been observing the process self-boost faster than advertised with HWMonitor.  The highest seen was 4.5 ghz.  Not sure if the app isn't showing it correctly or AMD sells the 2700 and 2700x as the same chip but with different coolers.,Cons:The stock cooler is barely sufficient.  I knew this going in and bought a Noctua (NH-U12S SE-AM4),Other Thoughts:Look at the 2700x with the stock cooler or this proc with an aftermarket cooler.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,It's a tank,2018-06-24,Pros:-heckin fast-stays decently cool under a Kraken X52-16 threads-beats the snot out of my old i7 4790K,Cons:-a difficult overclocker; voltages get pretty insane,Other Thoughts:I found that the most stable settings for this CPU in my system are 4.2Ghz at 1.36 Vcore on an X470 Ultra Gaming board.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Beastly,2018-06-19,"Pros:With good RAM, this thing is awesome!! At stock settings with 3600mhz B-die ram I have consistently pulled 1790 to 1803 on Cinebench. I'm impressed.","Cons:the prism cooler is awesome, if you don't plan on overclocking. I couldn't even pull 3.8 without thermal throttling.",Other Thoughts:I will be investing in an AIO or custom loop in the future... otherwise I'm convinced that I made the right choice.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great product for streaming amd rendering,2018-06-18,Pros:8 CORES !!! 16 THREADS!!!Very nice box cooler with beautiful RGB,Cons:Not the best in games compared with 8700k,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Works great.,2018-06-16,Pros:This thing destroys the competition.,Cons:None so far.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great,2018-06-15,Pros:You can hit 4.3 on a aio 1.3875v play games all day. I keep mine at 4.275 at 1.36875v keeps the fan noise down less heat. But 4.3 is do able. My h105i keeps it cooled well even OC. I just don't like my PC to sound like 747.,Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Its a Beast!,2018-06-15,"Pros:- Stock cooler keeps it nice and cool, no need for aftermarket cooling unless you are overclocking.- Chews through everything in its path!",Cons:none thus far,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing,2018-06-14,"Pros:I haven't owned an AMD processor in ten years.  But I'm glad I pulled the trigger and got this CPU.  It's amazing.  Playing Battlefield 1 in 4K with only 20% CPU usage.  Runs a little hotter than my previous processor, but I have to order and new AIO cooler.  It's disappointing that my Corsair Hydro H105 did not come with a AM4 bracket, so I'm using the included heatsink/fan.  Which is decent.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Bought it 2 weeks ago--  awesome,2018-06-12,"Pros:Fast, great, fast, great, get the wraith cooler- awesome",Cons:can't find one,"Other Thoughts:AMD has done their homework as a company.  Great processor, great price, classy, fast. This will do what you need; and then some."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AWESOME cooler and solid boost clocks!,2018-06-11,"Pros:-The Wraith Prism cooler looks incredible. Be sure to download the LIghting tool from Cooler Master and use the USB cable and plug it directly into a USB 2.0 header on your motherboard if you want full independent lighting control.-Works on current AM4 x370 boards with a BIOS update. No more having to buy a whole new board with every CPU like intel makes you do. Updated the BIOS on my Crosshair and everything was fine.-I see boost clocks as high as 4.295GHz on single core, 4GHz all core on medium load, and 3.7-3.9GHz under intense stress testing at stock settings.-Running my GALAX HOF ram at 3200mhz no problem.-8 cores of pure Ryzen goodness.","Cons:-It can't make me a sandwich.-I wish the cooler had a different latching mechanism, but this one does make it compatible with legacy AMD boards so I get it.",Other Thoughts:-Seriously buy it. The multiple advantages this has over the 8700k more than makes up for the small IPC difference.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"I don't own, just letting you know.",2018-06-08,Pros:- Fast- Runs at a great temperature- Cheapest 8 core 16 thread- Really great all around performance,Cons:- Is there one?,"Other Thoughts:This is advice / information for anyone looking for it.The Ryzen series was never intended to take the crown of most FPS from Intel. It did in some titles but all around Intel still has the most FPS at 1080p. That's just a fact, but does it warrant the higher price?There is no difference in fps at 1440p or 4k. Since it's graphic card dependent. That's just common knowledge you can find on anywhere on the web and on any tech youtuber's channel.AMD runs cooler then most Intel, due to soldered IHS, and not glued. Yes Intel has GLUED Integrated Heat Spreader. Please google and find out yourself if you do not believe, hence why ""delidding"" only exist for intel.When comparing a ryzen 5 to a intel i5, ryzen beats its out in terms of workstation work, rendering etc. EXCEPT in adobe premiere. cause adobe premiere has igpu enhancements. which is ""integrated graphics"" which intel incorporates in EVERY chip (well consumer) not xeons.Also AMD has APU's and they are pretty good, and I suspect they would do amazing in Adobe premiere with that feature enabled. but Ryzen 1 series and 2nd series do not have integrated graphics, and do not beat Intel in adobe premiere. They lose out by a landslide.... even an i5 8600, or 8600k beating even ryzen 2700x in adobe premiere.Those are just facts. Facts which can't be ignored and need to be considered, and can be found ANYWHERE on the web, or on any tech youtuber.As a ryzen user, I know it's a great chip for it's price. I have 1st gen ryzen not 2nd. But I kept up with all the benchmarks, all the tech youtubers. So I feel I've got a good grasp on what's what currently. Also I'm not a fan boy of either company, using both tech over the years, both amd and intel processors. So my view of them are not biased.I currently consider AMD to be the better value, ALL around. If you do more then just game, You're going to really want to consider AMD 5 series or 7 even ryzen 3... if you're looking for extreme value.And if you're a die hard gamer, who's just DYING for those high fps with their 1080ti, then you need a 8700k. Theres no doubt about it.Those are facts which can't be ignored and can be found anywhere, from anyone with knowledge.Hope this helps you in your endeavors!Cheers!"
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Ryzen without the bugs,2018-06-06,"Pros:-No bugs or long first boots as with Ryzen 1st gen-XFR works great and I honestly leave it be with no overclock-Runs much cooler than expected-Included cooler is much better than last gen, however I don't use it-Much better ram support",Cons:-Manual overclocking still not great (just use XFR),Other Thoughts:-Notes-So my vast increase in memory support may also be related to motherboard.  I am using an ASUS Crosshair Hero VII X470.Just use XFR as you get better clocks than manual without the increase in  heat.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Best CPU I have owned.,2018-06-04,Pros:Fast and cheap! Runs all my games faster than the old CPU.Not Intel.Fan has pretty colors.,Cons:Only thing I had to complain about is the fan. It gets REALLY loud. Would like better control of the fan speed via software. Might eventually get a different fan or liquid cooler but I cant figure out what to get yet.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,The fastest 8 core on the market,2018-06-03,"Pros:I did my research and up until now have always been an INTEL ONLY man. This is the ONLY publicly available multi core processor that allows ALL of the cores to run at the specified Ghz rating of the processor. Normally only the first or first two cores run at this speed while all of the other cores are banked to a lower and throttled lower at the same time as processor heats up. This processor has what AMD calls ""AI"", but is simple an algorithm to allow all cores to run at top processor speeds and only throttle the overheating cores. It will throttle all of them down, except the 1st two cores if that is what is required to prevent thermal overload, otherwise you get the public's first true 3.7Ghz 8 core processor. IT IS FASTER THAN a DUAL CORE XEON server that I built 5 years ago. The bottle neck for my build is the hard drives.","Cons:Did not come with step by step installation instructions for the included heat sink and the pictures where for different processors\sinks. It was simple enough to install, however I would have liked to have installed the heat sink 180 degrees from where it is now.","Other Thoughts:I highly recommend this for anyone needing more horse power - you would have to purchase a $1,500 Intel processor to compare to this! No Kidding! I did my research and I am very familiar with Intel processors."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fast and nice fan,2018-05-30,Pros:SpeedyGreat coolerEasy install,Cons:Price,Other Thoughts:This cpu is very fast and supports high speed ram. It comes with a great RGB led cooler and was easy to install with only 2 clips to attach to the motherboard. This cooler is much better and bigger than the one i had with a Ryzen 1600 cpu. The 2700x cpu is compatible with my Asus TUF B350 bios but you might need a bios update with your motherboard. The only bad thing is its price right now but it is well worth it if you want speed and the nice cooler. I still give 5 stars and recommend it. I purchased from Newegg Canada.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Major Upgrade!,2018-05-27,"Pros:-Zero issues installing/setting up.-Huge performance boost compared to my old fx-8150.-Wraith Prism cooler is adequate for stock use.-Hits the advertised 4.3Ghz boost. (I've observed cores hitting a max of 4,350mhz using stock XFR2 settings.)-Idle Temps around 35°C, gaming load 50°C, and full load on all 16 threads is around 68°C.-Plays any game at max or high at 60fps (Paired with 1070 ti FE @ 1920x1080)-Upgrade path for the next two generations on x470 platform is nice.",Cons:-It doesn't do the dishes.,"Other Thoughts:Overall, this processor was a huge upgrade for me.  I was considering the intel i5 8600k + aftermarket cooler, but I'm glad I waited to see what AMD would bring.  This was definitely a more cost effective choice.  I won't deny that the 8700k is superior in gaming, but if you're playing on a 60Hz monitor at 1080p, both processors will easily push more than you need.  With that in mind, Ryzen was the obvious choice due to the extra multi-threaded performance.10/10 Would Recommend!*Be sure to grab Ryzen Master & Grab the chipset driver that comes with the unique Ryzen power plan."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Hit 5.2ghz,2018-05-27,"Pros:I have my 2700x all on default settings on a custom cooling loop, I just checked and it was at 5185mhz (5.2ghz) while gaming",Cons:all the haters,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD has outdone themselves,2018-05-26,"Pros:-Wicked Fast, single core and multi core scores are INSANE- Stays cool and quiet, on full load with Prime95 and stock cooler and only 58C-BEAUTIFUL cooler, has high and low settings-Processor is great for gaming and running Virtual Machines, video encoding, photo editing, etc-My 7zip extracts go so fast that 7zip doesnt even open anymore, its just done-",Cons:-Absolutely none,"Other Thoughts:i Highly recommend this product to everyone that has high performance, and future-proofing in mind."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,None,2018-05-24,"Pros:Haven't stressed it yet, but a lot cheaper than Intel.LED fan ring.",Cons:The attachment to the motherboard was a but of pain; trying to get all four points.,"Other Thoughts:Upgrade from a Ryzen 1600, so it will be interesting to what this CPU can do."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,So Glad I switched to AMD!!!,2018-05-23,"Pros:Fast, responsive, great for multitasking.Love that it comes with the Wraith Spire, great cooler for a non AIO.I enjoy the RGB for the fan.Got it for gaming and it doesn't disappoint.","Cons:Wraith Spire doesn't play nicely with Asus Aura, you have to use AMD/Cooler Master software. It looks great though",Other Thoughts:I used AMD back in the day (late 90's early 2000's) and finally they have come out with competitor to Intel. Great price with cooler and SOOOO glad I made the change to AMD. Great for gaming!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fanatstic,2018-05-22,Pros:Great price.Great performance .Manually overclocked to 4.29 Ghz Stable .1.393 Volts .All 16 Cores .71 degrees max temp with liquid aio cooler .Chews through content creation tasks .,Cons:0,"Other Thoughts:Yes.By all means .If you are looking for a strong stable and very responsive computing experience , this is the processor for all of those needs ."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Upgraded from 3770k,2018-05-21,Pros:Very fast CPU. Handles Assassins Creed Origins like a champ.It is about as fast as my overclocked 3770k in single thread. In multi thread it blows it away.Good price too,Cons:-IMC is weak. Could not boot my RAM at the advertised speed of 3600mhz. It does run at 3000mhz with tight timings however. RAM specifically is CMR32GX4M4C3600C18 in case anyone wants to know.,"Other Thoughts:My message to AMD is this:Zen+ is great and I am relieved that I do not need to swap to a new socket when I upgrade to Zen 2. I have not purchased an AMD processor since my old 4200 X2 and I can see you guys have definitely stepped your game up. Please get the IMC performance up for Zen 2 and please get single thread performance up as well.UPDATE just tried out the Wraith Spire after my H100i v2 died. Temps are quite a bit higher than the AIO, will be switching back to water ASAP. AMD please sell the coolers separately, no bundle is needed. Anyone buying a $300 cpu will most likely be going aft er market for a cooler. I would rather see a reduced price for the cpu."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Super fast, easy set up",2018-05-20,Pros:Stock cooler is actually pretty nice. Temps stay  at 53-58 even under load for me. Go's fast and auto overclocked to 4.3 right away.,Cons:Cant think of any so far...,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Quick and easy to setup !!,2018-05-20,Pros:The Ryzen 7 has all of the features i need and makes my gaming experience  great best responses i have ever had.,Cons:so far i can find no negative results from this processor.,Other Thoughts:I whole heartedly recommend the Ryzen series of processors for first time builders and professional assemblers.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great CPU!,2018-05-17,"Pros:- Comes with a decent cooler that's not forcing you to buy another one right off the bat and no need to delid it to get acceptable temps. I will get one soon though, I'm just not in a hurry, thanks to it. Temps are totally under control even with stock cooler. The default fan curve in the Bios was way too aggressive and loud. I edited it and now it's very tolerable and temps don't go past 72 °C even with the much lower fan curve. It runs at 4.2 Ghz pretty much all the time by itself with precision boost in a HAF X case.- Runs all recent games with a low utilization with a lot of room for more work in contrary to 4 cores/threads CPUs like all i5 until the 8400. I can't imagine a 8400 still being great in 2-3 years from now. If you absolutely want Intel, go with 8700 or 8700k, if you can't, go AMD Ryzen. R7 2600 will last you longer than 8600k in games, I'm sure about it. Ryzen and Ryzen+ are not Bulldozer. AMD is back to real relevance VS Intel.- Gone are the stutters in games with my CPU running at pretty much 100% utilization before. I come from a i5 4670k @ 4.3 Ghz with the same quantity of RAM (16Gb). 4 threads are not cutting it anymore and it has been like this for at least a year now. People needs to stop saying that old 4C i5 are enough for gaming even now, it's not true. It it for most games but not all. Believe it or not, it was holding down my RX 480...yeah, a RX 480. I was not 100% sure that the stutters were from my cpu but now I have the proof and I'm very happy that my card can now sing at the top of its lungs. Battlefield 1, Battlefront II, Far Cry 5, Star Citizen improved A LOT, Final Fantasy 15 was a stutters fest and it did so hard that it crashed the game some times...not anymore, Witcher 3 , Well, you get the point, gaming on it is great and it solved my problems with lags and stutters.","Cons:- I wish it was able to hit close to 5 Ghz, it would have been more than a great CPU and a good contender to the i7 8700k, it could be the undeniable go to CPU. For me, it is though. Games can use 16 threads now...","Other Thoughts:I highly recommend it for those with 4 cores CPU with no Hyper threading. The difference in some games is night and day, even on my lowly RX 480. Enjoy, guys! Great CPU AMD, I'm impressed. My last AMD cpu was a Phenom II X6 1090T...you got me back on board! Welcome back in the game."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,fast 4.3 ghz,2018-05-17,Pros:good overclocker,Cons:none on processor,Other Thoughts:none
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Upgrade from 1700X to 2700X installs with no glitches!,2018-05-16,"Pros:Installed on my ASUS X370 without any problems whatsoever. Had already updated BIOS to one compatible with the 2000 series a couple months ago. Exchanged the CPUs and it started up with no issues and no changes to the BIOS or any other hardware. Just for kicks I upgraded the speed to 4.2 on all cores and found it stable. Did not try anything higher. Only issue now is to sell my 1700X. Was it a smart to upgrade from the 1700X, probably not, but I just had to do it anyway. For others upgrading I would not suggest doing what I did as the upgrade was not that significant of an upgrade from the 1700X.",Cons:None so far.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this CPU for anyone either building a new quality computer or to anyone upgrading their CPU using a quality X370 motherboard. So far I see no real need for me to upgrade the motherboard at this time.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fastest CPU I have owned,2018-05-12,"Pros:- Perfect, fastest CPU i have owned for gaming, VM's, plex, etc",Cons:- None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Intel single thread equivalent/massive multi-thread,2018-05-10,Pros:-It's only about 3% slower in compared to Intel's current line-Faster in multi-threaded compared to Intel's current line-Cheap but a good cheap-FAST-Very Responsive-Better Memory Controller-Faster Clock Speeds than 1st Gen Ryzen-Lower Cache Latency but not not as good as Intel's,Cons:-Still not 100% there with Ryzen yet AMD has to refine it to 7nm before it can be fully utilized so a 3 year period-Gaming isn't as good compared to Intel's at 1080p but who plays in 1080p with a 300$ cpu and 700$ gpu?-Clock speed not quiet there yet which 7nm will hopefully put it at 5.0ghz with Ryzen 2.,Other Thoughts:-Get Ryzen 2600x if you game-Ryzen 2700x is currently the best multi-threaded cpu you can buy for 320$ at the moment and you can get it cheaper on E(bay)-Core to core latency is high still even with Fast memory but 3400-3600 memory Samsung B die does help tremendously.-You really can't tell a difference playing games on Intel or Ryzen chips any longer.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,This a fantastic processor,2018-05-10,"Pros:It much faster than the i7 5820k it replaces, 8 core 16 threads what not to love!! if your a true pc enthusiasts you will love this processor.",Cons:claiming that 5820k is faster is you have screw loose somewhere.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Absolutely phenomenal gaming and productivity,2018-05-09,Pros:Stock cooler is great for gaming / light productivity loadsMassive performance increase in games from my R7 1700 (+20% in most games)No need to OC to extract performanceSpectre / Meltdown have little impact,Cons:Stock cooler is loud under full productivity loads,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Far faster than my Intel i7 5820K !,2018-05-08,"Pros:Fast, I mean really fast! Comparable to the much more expensive 8700K. I'm a gamer and video editor and this thing rocks! I'm getting around 10-15 more fps in games on the same Geforce GTX 980ti I had in my 5820K build!",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Coming from many Intel builds this is definetly a must buy! I also have a Threadripper 1950X which is also a beast but I am currently using it as my mining rig.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,The Icing on the cake for Ryzen.,2018-05-07,Pros:-Increased memory compatibility-Reductions in memory and cache latency-Great Stock cooling-XFR2 is a great improvement over XFR that basically Overclocks for you!-Great Value!,Cons:-Nothing!,"Other Thoughts:AMD did a great job with the processor. The processor seems to accept ram up to 3600mhz~ now which is great, and will potentially negate the issue of XMP profiles not working unless you have very, very high speed ram. For the Average user, this is a welcome change, as it allows for better plug n play functionality. Adding on to this is XFR2, which basically auto OCs the processor by itself depending on workload. If I play something that's single thread dependent, such as League of Legends, or Dolphin Emulator, then my CPU will auto overclock to it's max frequency, and when all cores are under load, the CPU will stay at around 4.0ghz, basically making overclocking unneeded. The stock cooler does great for this, and cools the cpu great while keeping silent. Since you don't really need to overclock this chip, that means that AMD have created a CPU that is not only an incredible value, but also a very good ""Plug and Play"" CPU.I happily await AMD's next product."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,Switched from intel i7-6700k,2018-05-05,Pros:Feel the different when i use the quickbook and productive.8 Core 16 Threads. Good Stuff!!!Able overclocked out of boxes with ASUS ROG Crosshair VII Hero(Wi-Fi),Cons:Recommend use water cooling if you want overclocked.I was using the stock fan. the temperature aroudn 40-45oC idle. Prime 95 run around 80oC something.Motherboard x470 chipset need more update !,Other Thoughts:Switched Cooling to Thermaltake Floe AIO Riing RGB 360 TT Premium Edition. idle around 35-40oC Prime run stay around 57-62oC. run at 4.1GHZ
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,2,dissapointing really Intel is still better  get an 8700K,2018-05-04,Pros:CHEAPER 8 core available,Cons:Slower than intelBugs like I coudlnt use VMware workstation 14when I enabled virtualization capabilities  the OC that I had 4.3ghz became totally unstableHad to flash beta bios to X470 Master SLI/ac  to be able to run rams at 3466mhz ( they are 4266mhz) also I had to use dimm A2 and B2 if not I was stock at 2800mhz.,Other Thoughts:if you own a X99 by no chance move to this  I going back to my 5820K at 4.7ghz that really is 4 years older than this and is still better than this for gaming and its rock solid yeah it uses more electricity but  hey is 4 years old tech.Nice try AMD but keep trying
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Awesome alternative to Blue Team flagship CPU.,2018-05-03,"Pros:-Comes with a top-notch cooler. I've been doing this stuff for years and have never seen a stock cooler I'd even CONSIDER leaving on. Performs EXTREMELY well. If I didn't already have a big AIO I'd just bolt this puppy on and call it a day.-Most of the issues people had with 1st gen Ryzen are solved here : Is able to use much faster ram without complaint and gets a pretty nice boost in single/multicore max speed.-Silicon lottery isn't much of an issue here. Your CPU WILL boost to 4.3 for single core loads, and will hit 3.9-4.1 on all-core depending on your cooling. In other words, works EXACTLY as advertised.-With some tuning and fiddling, comes within spitting distance of it's main competition in single core loads and DEMOLISHES it in multi-core.","Cons:-Has yet to make me dinner. Does everything else though, so I'm holding out hope.","Other Thoughts:-1903 Cinebench score after tuning. Gaming, I never realized how bad my 2600k was holding me back with a 1070. Playing while streaming is fluid and 1% frametimes are awesome.-If you're already on a 1st gen Ryzen setup and you're flush with cash, don't hesitate to pull the trigger. If you're like me and like hanging on to a platform/CPU for a while you might wanna wait. That said, if you're coming from anything Haswell or older, don't hesitate. This thing is the bee's knees."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Great Improvement over first generation!,2018-05-03,"Pros:Higher clocks than 1st gen, even if it is a little bit. runs at 4.0 Ghz right out of the box and XFR 2 is a great improvement over the first generation and my chip actually hit 4.35 Ghz and more often than my old 1600X which this replaced. works great in my Asus Crosshair VI. it is pointless to overclock this chip, persuing higher speed memory offers a greater improvement than overclocking in general. on manual overclock I got 4.2 with 1.425 volts but I got better scores letting the chip go on it's own. the stock cooler is beautiful but I would suggest not using it if you are overclocking.",Cons:no cons really. you can't beat the price to performance on this chip!,Other Thoughts:this is a great chip!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amd hits Home Run with Ryzen 7 2700X,2018-05-03,"Pros:Wow... I was impressed. I upgraded from a i7-6700K and the difference was night and day.- Automatic overclock. I have seen > 4.4 Ghz (on 1 to 2 cores) with a good water cooling setup- Processor runs cool.  With a decent AIO liquid cooling setup you can expect to see temps in the mid 50's while gaming, stress testing took it to just to mid 70's- When paired with a decent X470 board, memory finally boots to 3200 on stock bios settings.  Adds a good 4-5% across gaming benchmarks just having memory running at stock speeds.- Comes with a more than adequate heatsink. The heatsink itself is on par with heatsinks costing $40-$50 alone. More than adequately cools a stock to mildly overclocked system- Overall just an amazing processor for the money.","Cons:- Slightly slower than Intel when benchmarked against Coffey Lake and Kaby Lake on single threaded tasks- While it overclocks way better than original Zen processors, expect about half as much as what Intel will generally do","Other Thoughts:This processor hands down beats current Intel offerings.  It will easily handle any application, benchmark, or current / on the horizon games at Max resolutions.  Games are beginning to take advantage of more cores.  This processor will keep your PC on the cutting edge for years to come."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Ryzen 2700X is the total package. Ryzen, all grown up.",2018-05-01,"Pros:-4.0 GHz all-core, 4.2 GHz 2-core boost at STOCK settings with ASUS PRIME X470 Pro-AMD and motherboard partners fixed the DRAM support nightmare: I run 2x16GB 3000CL15 RAM at 3000CL16 with ASUS D.O.C.P. settings.-Full X470 board availability at launch, unlike Ryzen 1-AMD improved memory and cache latency, the Achilles Heel of Ryzen 1-AMD fixed the segfault error that affected some Ryzen 1 chips-AMD improved the clock speed, especially for few loaded cores-AMD included RGB heat sink that looks awesome and performs perfectly for this CPU at STOCK clocks. Blows away Intel stock cooler.-""X"" version is priced appropriately for the convenience of a factory overclocked CPU, unlike Ryzen 1-Brand new Ubuntu 18.04LTS support on day 1, unlike Ryzen 1","Cons:-Stock cooler is great for most people, but if you leave this at full load, it's very audible. Definitely get aftermarket tower for OC. Full load temps up to 70C (stock voltage) in a well-ventilated case - adequate but not ideal for 24/7 load or serious overclocking.","Other Thoughts:Ryzen 1 was awesome but rushed. Ryzen 2 is a mature product and everything works great on Day 1. Great performance and value, even if you do zero tweaking.AMD gave customer what we want: MOAR RGB, more cooling, more performance, more stability, fewer quirks. Ryzen 1 launch was for tinkerers; Ryzen 2 launch is the boring dependability we expect from Intel. AMD is ready for prime time."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"Worked well, great cooler, met it's overclock claim.",2018-04-30,"Pros:- With it's inbox cooler, and a well ventilated case with good airflow, it goes slightly higher than 4.3ghz in it's stock configuration without any manual overclock. Sits at 4ghz when doing normal workloads like browsing and so forth. I have not seen it get warmer than 62C, and that was during stress tests and a brief portion of 3D Mark Timespy Extreme",Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:If you have good airflow in your case, or a good cooler, the 2700x will basically take care of it's own overclock. You can overclock it yourself, but you won't have much headroom. This isn't a negative towards the processor, but a positive toward how well it has been designed that it takes the work away from Overclocking.Instead, overclock your memory and gain a huge performance increase with this new Ryzen series chip.If you do love manually overclocking, I would suggest picking up the 2700, saving the money and you will be able to push it just as far."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"NO OVERCLOCKING, GOOD OR BAD?",2018-04-30,"Pros:No need to overclock an X Chip now.. You may get a better Cinabench score by overclocking to 4.2 or 4.3 on all cores.. But I'm already hitting 4.4 on one core without overclocking or over volting.. Under load all cores hang around 4.05 to 4.1 and I only have a corsair H60 Push Pull config for cooling..SPEC's On my RIG,,, X370 Taichi, FlareX 3200 14T, NZXT 340S white case, Rosewell 600 Watt PSU, Samsung 500 GIG 850 EVO, 1T  Hard drive, Corsair H60 CLC, and an RX 480.. Haven't been able to up grade GPU because of pricing.. BUT that is next as soon as Vega' 64 come down to earth again.. For now The Rx 480 is enough for 1080 Max settings 1440P on Med to High settings and some games in 4K believe it or not.. DOOM on Vulkan can be play in 4K on Medium settings with an RX 480 Believe it or not.. Need freesync because frames average around 50FPS, but for a 3 year old card that an't bad at all..Finally, This is a great chip, works perfect on X370 as long as you update BIOS' CHIPSET DRIVER's Most Important from AMD web site.. ( Had Memory Cold Boot Issues until I updated the Chipset Driver's...) This is a Very smart chip.. It makes overclocking foolish unless you are going with a non X variant like the 2700 and 2600, then I would overclock with good cooling.. But there is no need to overclock with the X chips.. AMD is already getting the best over all performance out of thesee chips for YOU","Cons:ONE, wish it would hit 5.0 on all cores.. LOL.... Seriously this is the best chip, I have ever owned and been building PC and gaming on them since 2006ish....","Other Thoughts:In reality if you already have a 1700X or 1800X that runs STABLE on all cores at 4.0 with 3200/3600 Memory all day long!!??  Then you should hold off till next Gen.. But for me who bought a R7 1700 a year ago and couldn't get it to play well with any memory or get it pasted 3.9 without throwing a ton of volts that were very unsafe at it.. This is a great upgrade across the board.. There were a lot of us who bought bad 1700 last year thinking we were going to see 4.0 at 3600 memory and all we saw were blue screens, and lost the lottery Badly..  If you are one of them then this might be for U, But for anyone who was always used to owning Intel, Look you U don't have to be afraid of an AMD system ANYMORE...  Another home run for AMD....  There's a reason Intel keeps stealing AMD VP's and developer's..."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Excellent cooler included,2018-04-30,"Pros:The included Prism cooler is very well built.  The RGB lighting is bright and clear and looks fantastic.  A high-end CPU like this will often be paired with an aftermarket cooler, but it's a great value to have the stock unit be of such a high quality.  If air cooling, there's no point to using anything below a top-end Noctua, as the stock cooler is very similar in design and performance to the standard aftermarket CPU coolers from brands like Corsair and Coolermaster.",Cons:None,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Very Happy with Ryzen 7 2700,2018-04-29,Pros:Includes great stock cooler with aesthetic RGBGreat multithreading benchmarksEfficient TDP,Cons:Intel single core performance slightly better,Other Thoughts:Ryzen second gen performs right up there with the best enthusiast processors and should strongly be considered by anyone looking to upgrade.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,very fast,2018-04-29,"Pros:even upgrading from a 1700x the difference is noticeable.not forced to upgrade your chipset, backwards compatible with x370.",Cons:slightly higher tdp than 1700x,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Exactly what I expected,2018-04-28,Pros:It OC'ed to 4GHz automaticaly with my MB and cheap AIO. Solid 66 degrees at full load in a Cooler Master Mastercase Pro 5 (Good airflow).,Cons:Can't think of any.,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,what a jump in quality,2018-04-27,Pros:-great stability-great OC-great gaming perf,Cons:Nothing to say,Other Thoughts:I was with a Fm2+ A10-7850k....could barely run pubg or bf1 in 1080p at 60 fps....now jumping at 120 all the time combine with Ram speed of 3600 mhz... yeahhhhhhh
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,"No issues building a brand new system with this beast! Precision Boost is amazing with aftermarket cooling, highly recommend for multitasking and gamers alike!",2018-04-26,"Pros:retailer pluses:-one stop shop, had all items i needed for my build from newegg without having to part my system out from a bunch of places.-easy order, good customer service when I had questions.- good pricing for launch items.Product and Company-AMD knocks it out of the park with this one, it runs very cool with my kraken x62 watercooler-Precision boost is amazing-Ryzen master great utility for monitoring my temps under load-Super easy installation, and I will be able to donate my prism cooler to a friend who wants better temps on his new build.-New warranty regulations about overclocking and aftermarket cooling. (you aren't voiding a warranty with aftermarket cooling anymore)-This processor would have been over $1000 CDN 2 years ago before zen architecture, thank you AMD for releasing these processors at a consumer friendly price. It has been an amazing ride and you have a fan for life.","Cons:-Newegg retailer was amazing no complaints from that aspect-Ryzen 2 ram tuning is a bit of a pain if you want to overclock your stuff. Some users of other websites have so graciously made calculators to help with this aspect so keep your eyes out for that application. With maturity will come better bios support, and with that better ram tuning, and I can hopefully get that extra bit of performance by clocking my ram higher.",Other Thoughts:Thank you for the wonderful product!
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Runs Circles around 1st Gen Ryzen...FAST circles,2018-04-26,"Pros:- Out of the box runs stock at faster than the best OC you could imagine from a first gen Ryzen 7 (1700/1700X/1800X)- Memory compatibility is night and day difference from Ryzen 1. MUCH improved stability compatibility and speeds.- The stock cooler is a monster, for a stock cooler and while most ppl will use aftermarket cooling, this thing is so sexy, it's hard to part with it.- Backwards compatibility is great. You do NOT NEED and X470 board to make this thing into a beast. The Asus Prime X370 Pro has more than enough HP to drive it hard. Easily OC's over 4.3 GHz on all cores, despite what some of these YouTube know-it-alls will tell you. It's all about the finesse. ;)-Multitasking is just unreal with this thing. I can apparently type reviews while running an AIDA stress test in the background, if that tells you anything.",Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:Couple things, just to think about:If you already own a Ryzen 7 from the first generation, you really don't NEED this upgrade. It's a refresh and optimization, not a new architecture. While there are certainly some nice improvements, they aren't big enough to make sense to ditch a great CPU that you just bought last year. But if you're in the market to build a new PC, this is simply the best bang for your buck. It does it all, and it does it fast."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,AMD impressed and Intel lover,2018-04-25,Pros:Stock got advertised speed of 4.3 according to cpuz (get the new version)This thing at stock is as good as my overclocked I75820k @4.3ghz (had to downgrade oc from 4.5 due to patch for meltdown issue) on a single core application bench and blows it out of the water for multi-core applicationsI am a streamer so using the same cpu to game and encode and I can 1080@60fps on the fast setting in OBS with ANY game which is impressive cpu max 78 percent.,Cons:cons? erm what Mate no cons here mate unless you hate AMD for some reason,"Other Thoughts:This is an amazing CPU with my ram running effortlessly at 3200. The only con which may worry some people is some software reports its temps really high like 90C when in actual fact its low like 30. I noticed this with corsair link and speccy but if you get the ryzen master software that tells the real temp and correlates with the bios temps too. People like to complain about none OC, personally I have no need to OC such a monster yet as there isnt nothing I do that pushes it. Grab this CPU throw a decent cooler at it (I have a corsair H115I) and you'll be happy. Great price, great product AMD have done themselves proud."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,4,"Great Chip, Great power, Misleading marketting (disappointed by poor OC and unworthy upgrade from last gen)",2018-04-24,Pros:- 8 Cores 16 Threads @4.2Ghz (OC)- Additional PCIE 3.0 functionality- Better clock speeds and per-core performance over previous gen (1700/1700x/1800x) due to XFR and SenseMI- Backwards Compatibility for older AM4 Mobo,Cons:- No overclocking headroom (check the youtube reviews)- In neither Manual nor Auto settings did even a single core reach the advertized 4.3Ghz (while cooled by 240 AIO) anything over 4.2Ghz in manual OC crashes no matter what.- Advertized scores in Cinebench etc are not achievable without heavy manual overclocking on most chips and are not representative of how a system can be run 24/7 (at least until software improves),Other Thoughts:Doubtless this is a great CPU but I advise anyone that does not HAVE to have that couple extra 100-200Mhz to just get the massively discounted Ryzen 1700 and overclock it to 4.0Ghz.
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,amazing upgrade from FX8350,2018-04-23,"Pros:stock cooler is great, but still wanted to use my h60. this thing is amazing ram speeds actually stay and are very simple to get working. it easily went to 4.25 Ghz on all cores, and if not manually O.C xfr 2.0 may actually be better.",Cons:can't think of any.,"Other Thoughts:single core performance doesn't match Intel's, but it's pretty dang close for less and more cores/threads overall."
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Fast and smooth,2018-04-21,Pros:Stock 2700x is as fast as my 1800x OC'd to 4Ghz on all cores.Runs smooth and handles faster memory better,Cons:None so far,None
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,hitting 4.5+GHz without overclocking,2018-04-21,Pros:Installed on a X370 mobo. Extending the life of that component.Hardware Monitor shows 56C temps and 4.1 to 4.5 CPU speed range on an EVGA CLC 120 AIO.,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:Great value
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,Amazing product,2018-04-21,"Pros:Almost everything about this product is positive. Price, performance, event the heat sink is amazing.",Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:I think the AM4 socket (without cpu) is a little...ugly...
AMD,YD270XBGAFBOX,5,A little better than the 1700x,2018-04-21,Pros:8 cores 16 threadsCan use your old board (see cons also)Seems to have a slightly lower idle temp over 1700xThis is faster than the 1700x was at its peak OC at stock clocksDefinitely gives you a few more fps in games,Cons:Compatability with older boards still no betterOCing on the 370 Krait gaming is non existentMemory speeds are no better using all the same components as I was with the 1700x,Other Thoughts:If you are thinking you'll see much difference stepping up from previous generation Ryzen don't expect much of a difference.
