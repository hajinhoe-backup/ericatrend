Productivity with the capability for gaming on the side! The camera on the bottom does kind of blow but to be honest, I never use the camera so it doesn't bother me at all.

I wish it came with an nvme drive to start but it was way too easy to add a new one that I just decided to buy my own and use the included drive as a semi fast external backup drive.-Size matters and this little guy does its job and can stay relatively cool considering the power inside, but in a very small form factor.-USB C port is always a plus-Keyboard can be a little stiff at first but when you get acquainted to the required pressure it takes, the keys are a treat to type on.-The display is as I expect an IPS display to be. Correct colors with the pantone certification and very adaptable to users who prefer blue light filters. I keep my blue light setting around the mid level.-one more huge benefit is the laptop is completely user serviceable. The memory, hard drive, network card, and cooling unit are all easily accessible after removing the back panel. Kudos to Gigabyte for doing this, as well as adding a HUGE battery.","Cons:-I needed to reinstall windows to get everything to work correctly. Not that it didn't ""work"" out of the box, but seemingly some of the included software slowed things down. This was remedied by windows clean installation. Performance shot up dramatically after doing this.-No infinite scroll in the included firmware.-Not a very fast included SATA m,2 drive.","Other Thoughts:I would not hesitate to recommend this laptop to any of my tech capable friends, however I feel that if you are not a power user or someone familiar with managing your own software installation then this laptop may be a little more tricky to get working as intended.",2,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,"Good balance between data science, business, and gaming",2019-01-31,"Pros:* Very sleek, sexy, and aesthetic design.* Packs powerful, modern hardware.* Great battery life.* Fully capable of running GNU/Linux.* Very capable of performing deep learning tasks via Torch/Tensorflow.","Cons:* Hardware is very new, and driver support isn't stellar.* Smart Manager & Smart Update are unintuitive, mistranslated, glitchy, and even fail.* The keyboard is strange.  Brightness keys aren't traditionally bound to the `XF86MonBrightness` standard.  Therefore, even native Windows support for these brightness keys is permanently lacking.* Installing GNU/Linux is unintuitive, and having modern NVIDIA hardware will probably cause boot failures.* Unfortunately, backlight bleed is a real problem.","Other Thoughts:* Run a modern version of Windows 10 for the least amount of pain.  Or, use GNU/Linux with a modern kernel.* To install GNU/Linux, it's best to disable 3D acceleration in the BIOS, blacklist `nouveau`, then re-enable 3D acceleration.  Grab the proprietary NVIDIA driver if you want.* My Linux distribution of choice is Debian Stable with backports.  I still haven't figured out how to get bumblebee working.Worth it?  If you're like me, the high-end Dell and Lenovo laptops are likely a better choice.  However, when considering the price and Black Friday sale, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",0,0

Did not expect receiving an unit with a slightly defective keyboard. The number 1 key and the W keys ignore inputs 10% of the time, making running and switching weapons in video games a huge pain. Replacements for the keyboard is not available right now according to Gigabyte. This is something I can live with since I do play on an external keyboard sometimes but I can totally understand the pain of having keys that ignore inputs when you need them to work.","Other Thoughts:A great looking laptop that packs a beast inside its small form. I do recommend this if you can deal with returning for an unit with non-defective keyboard or play on a separate keyboard. Clean installation and drivers adjustment, tuning is recommended for this laptop to run smoothly.",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Great Laptop!,2019-01-25,"Pros:When I got this laptop, I had a few worries about how I would use it on a daily basis. Safe to say this laptop has given me no problems whatsoever! One of my favorite things about the Aero 15x is the 144Hz panel, which makes not only gaming, but generally using Windows such a smooth experience. The 1920x1080 screen is crisp and clear, and colors are always accurate whenever I need to do creative work for school. Plus, the thin bezels are great too. Haven't played too many games, but the frame rate has always been smooth, and it seems like it'll handle almost anything I can throw at it. One thing I especially like is the black design of the laptop. I don't personally care for gamer aesthetic red, so having a gaming laptop that's subdued on the outside is great. The battery life so far has been excellent, I'm able to bring my laptop to school for a majority of the day and not have to charge it once is great. While I haven't tried playing any games on the battery, general productivity should be a breeze without having to stay attached to the power adapter. In the case you need it, the laptop is fairly light for all the power is holds, so carrying around on your back shouldn't be too much of problem.","Cons:I think having the webcam at the bottom, while necessary, isn't always nice. The webcam itself is pretty big, so I think it should be a higher quality than it is currently. All in all, a nose up view isn't always the best thing to show to other people. The laptop does have some bloatware, so take that as you may. Outside of that, I can't think of too many issues with the computer.","Other Thoughts:Now, I've only have the laptop for a few days now, so I'll probably need to give a review in future months after spending some more time with it. First impressions have been spectacular so far, and I think other people need to look into this computer. Granted, it's a bit pricey, and the RTX version of the computer isn't too far away now. I got this computer on sale, so I think that's the best time to pick up this computer. Overall, this is a great computer!",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Portable Yet Powerful,2019-01-25,Pros:- Extremely slim profile- Great build quality- Expandable RAM and SSD option,"Cons:- Poor webcam placement- Included SSD is SATA, not NVMe",,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Great first experience,2019-01-23,Pros:A great premium look that does not sacrifice performance. I ran a large number of programs at once with no issues and the thunderbolt port is a very welcome addition.

The laptop should really come with the proper version of windows 10 out of the box to avoid this.,"Other Thoughts:**Linux Stuff**This isn't gigabytes fault but getting linux to run on this thing is a bit more involved than any other laptop Ive had in the past.For one thing the nouveau drivers straight up do not work on this machine, Linux wont even boot with them loaded. To get linux and the nvidia gpu to work on this machine you need to disable the nouveau drivers with grub. You can do this by pressing e on the entry youre trying to boot to open the grub text editor anddisabling the nouveau drivers in the boot entry (there's a reddit thread on this if you google ""gigabyte aero 15x linux"").Once you boot in you need to install the proprietary nvidia drivers, the process for which varies from distro to distro.The problem with enabling only the nvidia drivers is that with out gpu switching the nvidia GPU will always be enabled resulting in less than 3 hours of battery life.It is possible to get gpu switching to work with bumblebee. Personally I haven't been able to get bumblebee to work properly on my machine running fedora 29 but I've seen people online running bumblebee just fine so you millage may vary.",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,2,"Not bad, could have been great",2019-01-15,"Pros:Good graphics performance once your game loadsDecent battery life for productivity/ web browsingSlim, light, awesome backlit keyboard","Cons:My 4 year old tower PC boots faster, is more responsive, and cost half as much as this computer.  After doing some research this is apparently due to the garbage transcend SSD and the single stick of ram(ie. not using its dual channel capability out of the box).  Windows file explorer takes a full second to open which takes less than half that time on my old PC with an older Samsung SSD.   Gigabyte's own smart update utility takes over 20 seconds just to load.  Game load times are embarrassingly slow.  When playing online with my friends, their older PC's load/ spawn in Wildlands in half the time or worse and I have a faster ISP than them.  I was expecting much better performance from this computer and i cant believe the fix is just to drop about $400 more for a good SSD and ram upgrade kit.","Other Thoughts:The review units they sent out apparently had Toshiba SSD's and better ram, this is a very misleading practice and i feel that I've been ripped off by Gigabyte by providing a different setup than the review units i based my purchase on.   Newegg as always was great, but I think I'm on my own with this one as none of the above is really their issue.",1,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Good hardware with questionable Software,2019-01-12,Pros:- 144hz Screen- full keyboard- awesome battery life,Cons:- The Gigabyte Smart-manager software is terrible. when tabbing through open applications you'll see a GBSOD window that you cannot close or you will no longer be able to use the function keys to control the brightness. How Gigabyte doesn't have this running as a service is beyond me.- Elan Touch-pad software leaves a lot to be desired. Luckily you can install different drivers that allow windows precision touch-pad gestures.- I had some terrible lag on the windows installation that came with the system and had to re-image the machine with the Microsoft tool.- BIOS is very limited,Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this products to other even with its cons.

The issue was mostly resolved over a month later with a new round of driver updates.- Recently I installed Civilization VI.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,1,Screen issue,2018-12-31,Pros:Battery life,Cons:Gygabyte costumer service. See other thoughts.It’s performance/price does not separate it from the competition. Unless you absolutely need the larger capacity battery I would look elsewhere. The battery life is no where near 11 hrs with normal use. With aggressive battery management at the cost of performance and screen brightness you may get 6-8hrs.  With gaming expect 2-4 hrs with comprising.,Other Thoughts:Worked well for two weeks. The screen quit functioning. Went to wake it after quick trip to the store and was greeted by horizontal lines. Screen unreadable. The computer works when connected to external screen.

This is my first gaming laptop. I have no experience with other gaming laptop models so I cannot compare them. Because this is my first gaming laptop, it feels overwhelmingly positive of the new gains and features I am able to have with a laptop compared to a lower end, obsolete brand.   This laptop was easy to set up.I have read some complaints about screen backlight bleed.  Personally I haven't noticed any issues with my screen displaying it.  If it was actually present, apparently it isn't big enough for me to notice it. When I received this laptop, my first goal was to do a clean install, delete everything and reinstall drivers. I wasn't tech savvy enough to where I could successfully do it....  I had to go with the original factory settings. Surprisingly, I do not think this laptop comes with a lot of bloatware that I had imagined.The laptop speed is good, startup is fast.  I am happy it is able to play modern pc games without issues, has smooth gameplay.  I can't compare how it handles fps or thngs like that with other laptops, but I like how this has the option to be upgradeable.The cons I listed are not dealbreakers for me to not want to keep this laptop.

This is a bad thing I find unsatisfying.But, if you don't play cpu-intense games, that's totally fine and this laptop has great performance on work.You can set to different modes to fit your current work load. For games, set to high performance and the fan will be really noisy. For long battery life, set to power saver and frequency of CPU will be down to some 2000MHz. According to smart manager, it can last for 10 hours for web viewing.In conclusion, after buying such a premium level laptop the first time, I think the best choice is a lightweight (some 1kg laptop)+ 1 desktop for performance. But if you can only get one, just get this. Everything (software and hardware) is well made (except single ram) It is definitely the bang for the buck.Update:When I add a ram kit for aero15w, this guy becomes a real beast.For your reference, in csgo, I set graphics to low in 1080p, and set fps_menu_max 300.When it was equipped with only 1ram (The original one from Kingston), fps was some  180 at most.When it was equipped with 2 rams (1 Kingston 1 Crucial  CT16G4SFD8266 from newegg), fps goes to 270.Note: For cpu intense games, adding a ram really works.Why are you doing this to me, Gigabyte, why not dual ram?  This is a premium laptop and you should place it with 8gbx2 ram kits, which best releases the performance this model can get..",1,0

The laptop from the box is SUPER funky. Mouse stutters upon opening of windows, YouTube videos lag, just generally doesn't feel like a 6-core laptop with a 1070.- Sometimes your keys don't register, especially if you type near the edge/corner. (though very rare, probably depends on how you type)- NOT color accurate out of the box. I'm a professional film colorist and although the screen is beautiful, it still needs to be professionally calibrated for it to be accurate. I think they use a general color profile for all units which is not ideal since every panel is different.- Speakers lack bass.- The 512gb ssd that came with the laptop isn't that fast.- For some reason adding another 16gb ram is a pain. A lot of the 16gb DDR4 2666 in the market doesn't work. Somewhere in Reddit is a list of compatible ram for the Aero 15 but there have been reports that even those might not work. It took me 2 tries to find a working pair.","Other Thoughts:From all of the stellar reviews out there in addition to its equally stellar price point, I imagined to have no trouble using this right out of the box.

Feels like there might be slight keyboard chatter, but not enough to be very noticeable, but keys need to be pressed hard in in the center for consistent response.Better speakers would be nice too and this model definitely should've shipped with the intel 9260 wifi card.

On the outside, it does not look like a gaming laptop, but feels like one when opened up because of the RGB keyboard. Also, it is quite lightweight for having so much packed in it. I wish it had a fingerprint scanner for faster login, as well as more storage space, but that's why external hard drives exist. Not sure if it's just me, but the keyboard sometimes doesn't register keys when typing. The trackpad is definitely subpar to MacBooks, which are just so intuitive, but I am using mouse right now.Another thing is that there were a lot of updates, which is usually good, but I found out the hard way that in order for the camera to work, it needed to update to the latest Intel Graphics driver from Gigabyte's Smart Update app. Everything is working fine so far now, and I am excited to use this product to its fullest extent for years to come.",0,0

This remedied all software related issues, and the machine runs absolutely perfect.The unfortunate part of the aforementioned resolution is that it seems nearly all people must do this to get the performance out of their machine that is originally described, otherwise you're left with a very sub-par and disappointing laptop.I still don't like the keyboard placement at all, nor the fact that 9 times out of ten I miss the 'e' keystroke, but I believe with more time on the keyboard, I will be able to get used to this nuance.--- Original Review ---I don't think I can keep this pc. The keyboard is nice to type on, however, it requires a strong keystroke deliberately down the middle of the key. Otherwise, it misses the keystroke entirely. The keys are also recessed into the chassis slightly, causing them to be more difficult to press than usual, due to the odd angle they place your hands. The RGB feature is actually something I found very nice and easy to control, after you download and install the application. Granted, I set them to white while working, however, setting the keyboard to random RGB functions actually helps accentuate a room in subtle way that I wouldn't have expected.The edges of the laptop are square, and very sharp. It is aesthetically appealing, however, extremely uncomfortable to type on for long durations. It is equally uncomfortable to game on, as the edges feel as though they dig into your skin.The screen is absolutely amazing, however. Everything is crisp and clear, the 144hz monitor is absolutely a huge leap ahead of normal 60hz versions, and the colors are great. With that said, optimus causes your machine to hiccup every time you open a window so it can decide which GPU to use. This is beyond frustrating. To make matters worse, you cannot disable Optimus or the iGPU, so you're stuck living with this delay every time you open a new application. I've also not figured out how to enable the nVidia GPu without going into the control panel and setting it to run for specific applications, which is another annoyance that one should not have to deal with.The trackpad feels nice and is accurate, however, it is imperative to switch from ELAN to Windows Precision drivers, as you lose out on many gestures and the trackpad becomes even more accurate once you've doneso.All-in-all, for all the great reviews this laptop has received by reviewers, I have to admit I am extremely disappointed with the machine. While the performance is good, once you make the ncessary changes, I feel  you should not be required to spend 5-8 hours to set up a laptop to work properly out-of-the-box, which is exactly what I did.Overall, for many people, this machine would likely be a wonderful and long-lasting laptop. The entire laptop is made of quality products, from its aluminum chassis to the excellent glass trackpad and nice keyboard feel. The drawbacks mentioned earlier cause this machine to not be suitable for a daily business laptop that would also be used for gaming on the side, unfortunately.",1,2

It doesn't get too hot, no lag, and fans didn't get too loud.",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,"Sleek, serious performance laptop",2018-12-03,"Pros:- Lives up to its specifications, easily. Closer to the performance of a desktop with the same specs than I anticipated.- The display is amazing. Excellent brightness, good colors. Other reviews mention backlight bleeding at the bottom, and there's a bit, but it's only noticeable on black screens, and even then it's very mild. I'd recommend the 144hz over the higher resolution, personally. On a display this size you'd get more out of the higher refresh rate than you'd get out of 4k.- The batter life for the specifications is insane. Around 6+ hours for work and web browsing, up to 2 for more demanding gaming.. No laptop I've had has come close.- Remarkably light for it's class, and tightly, solidly built.- 512 GB SSD on top of everything else at the sale price I got it for? Insanity.","Cons:- The speakers are pretty quiet, and the sound quality is... not good. Better than a standard smartphone speaker but not by much.- A decent amount of the packaged software is bloat and unnecessary. Takes up too much of a memory footprint for what it does.- The software is currently having issues with updated drivers, or something of that nature. Most of the function keys--such as for brightness, toggling wifi, turning off the display, etc--no longer work. All of these can be adjusted using the icons in the notification area of the Windows taskbar, but still annoying. Volume control and keyboard backlight function keys still work, though.",,0,0

It is different and not successful in my opinion-The keys stick - I have had several keys stick - especially when it was new but they get better over time. I expected higher quality for a top of the line model-Battery life is great but I think 5-6 hours of normal use is about all you can expect compared to the 10 hours advertised.",,0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,,2018-12-02,Pros:- Great hardware.- Nice design and build quality.,"Cons:- Build quality is good, but after Macbook there are some noticeable little flaws. But it is not a unibody, so it is excusable and it is not a problem at all. However, a '7' key is dis-attaching when I press on the right lower part of it. This is quite annoying.- Trackpad is okay, but it could be better. Windows precision drivers improve the situation, but not dramatically.- There are software issues. For example, after latest Windows update I cannot change brightness, fan speed and some other things with Fn shortcuts. I hope it will be fixed in the future updates. Also, the tool which controls rgb-keyboard has a very limited functionality and few options for customization. I also don't like that keyboard's backlight doesn't turn off along with screen when laptop is idle long enough.- Some of the keys' backlight level is lower than other's. These are right shift, tab, caps lock.- I also noticed some screen's backlight bleed on the bottom corners. It is noticeable only when watching movies. Not a big issue, but a little bit disturbing.- Speakers are stereo but sound quality is just terrible. They are only usable for watching series. Even my 7 years old 13'' macbook's single speaker is better. That's why I am using headset.","Other Thoughts:I like this rig, but there are some small flaws, affecting the overall experience.

When I first opened the package, the laptop was surprisingly weighty and reflected its built quality. This laptop feels solid in your hands and it is very sleek.

Beautiful chassis, crystal clear screen, and blazing fast performance. My last machine was a mid-end Lenovo IdeaPad that I've had for 7 years, so I really appreciate the build quality in this machine. I'd love to see this thing go 10 years.","Cons:- The speakers don't match the rest of the quality on this laptop at all. They are not good.- No ability to power and charge the machine via Thunderbolt port.- Keyboard absolutely takes some time to get used to. It's definitely worse with the keyboard skin, but I'm getting more and more comfortable with it. Some keys on my machine won't register once in a while if they're hit off-center. Hitting them in the center gets them through every time, so this will inadvertently teach you to be more precise with your typing.- No dedicated trackpad buttons for left and right click. This seems to be rarer and rarer among newer machines, so can't fault it too much.","Other Thoughts:A few things to address points made in other reviews:- Keyboard backlighting is totally uniform on my machine. There aren't any keys that look out of place.- There might be a parts lottery with these machines based on the comparison to review units on popular notebook review sites.

The touchpad is somewhat hard to deal with, and clicking with it takes more force than other laptops I've used.","Other Thoughts:The microphone and webcam placement is questionable, but definitely not a reason to disregard buying this laptop.After getting past installing drivers and making minor personal tweaks, this laptop is much smoother and is not as disruptive as it was out of the box.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Great combination of features and performance with a few exceptions,2018-11-23,"Pros:Great features - 6 core CPU, maxQ GPU, 144hz display.  Great customer support after purchase from Gigabyte","Cons:11/23/18 EDIT: I lived with the laptop for another couple of weeks and eventually the SSD returned to poor performance - I think it must just be a combination of how i use the machine and the limitation of cache-less TLC nand drives like this Transcend unit.  I ended up getting a good deal on a Samsung 970 EVO which absolutely blows away the transcend unit AND maintains that performance over time.  The transcend has moved to storage/backup duty which is performs fine and without the constant load appears to retain write performance most of the time.The other ""issue"" with the machine is that it comes configured with a single stick of memory.  This really isn't a con in my mind as it allows for upgrading without discarding the original high-spec stick of memory.  However, I really felt that the machine was lacking some snappiness I knew a machine of this caliber should be able to achieve.  Maybe something to do with the integrated graphics sharing the system memory causing overall sluggishness. I found an equivalent spec stick of Kingston ValueRAM KVR26S19D8/16 DDR4-2666 SODIMM 16GB/2Gx64 REG CL19 Notebook Memory to add to the machine for a total of 32GB.  That is more memory than I need at this point but I'm certainly ready for anything I need the machine.  I could have been happy with 2x8GB sticks but I don't fault them for a single stick in this case for the reasons stated above.Between a clean install of Windows 10 on the Samsung drive and dual-channel memory performance the machine reaches its full potential and I'm very happy with it.  I took off an egg because it could have been at this level of performance from the factory with a different SSD (seems like there is a Toshiba drive they use in this same machine) and dual channel memory from the factory.10/30/18 EDIT:  I contacted Gigabyte support about the terrible SSD performance.  They agreed it was terrible.  They suggested I could send it back to Newegg or that they would RMA it as well but asked me to try doing a restore using the built-in recovery system.  So, after pressing F9 on startup and choosing that option I was presented with another clean install.  This time instead of trying to update drivers and install programs, etc. I ran an SSD benchmark and this time I very happy with the results - over 1400 mb/s read AND write.  That was actually faster than I would have expected but a pleasant surprise after the previous results (see below).  Kudos to GB support for the suggestion.  I don't know what happened but some combination of updates and drivers must have conspired to majorly hobble the storage performance.  All good now.The following no longer applies but is left for possible future owners that have the same issue I did.---------------------------After using the machine for 24 hours it has become clear that the included SSD is painfully slow.  For a 512GB NVME SSD (model ts512GMTE510t ) I would have hoped for better performance.  I'm getting at best 150 Mb/s sequential writes.  Unfortunately all the reviews I have found seem to have gotten a far superior Toshiba drive that doesn't suffer the same problem.  I updated all the drivers and bios and it's still the same problem.  I guess a DRAM-less TLC drive really suffers from the way I would like to be able to use the machine and compared to all the other SSDs I have.  Price?  It's expensive but a good value, especially with the included accessories",Other Thoughts:After an initial hiccup that was address by support I am now very happy with the purchase and overall package.,5,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,3,Amazing laptop! but unfortunately I got a lemon.,2018-11-23,Pros:- Easy driver update using GIGABYTE software- Runs really smooth- Great graphics- Not a lot of bloatware,"Cons:- To fully update all the drivers TOOK HOURS- Utilities doesn't have anything to help you with overclocking unlike other gaming laptops- The Gigabyte Fusion, RGB keyboard control, causes the screen to flicker during windows logon. FYI just disable it from start up and it will be fine.- The screen bleed on 4 corners is pretty bad, but if you really don't mind like me it doesn't really matter.- Sadly last part is what made me rate it 3-Stars, I got a lemon after fine tuning the machine for 5 hours I found out that the ""Tab"" key was broken. Pressing the key won't register it while the on-screen keyboard ""Tab"" key works perfectly fine. I also did all the updates and still no luck. I even tried taking the key off and pressing it manually to check if there was something stuck but i still didn't find anything. Buying an expensive laptop like this, one would assume that it has gone through under extensive Quality Assurance procedure but its definitely where they dropped the ball",Other Thoughts:- I would recommend this laptop and pray that the item your received isn't a lemon.- I'll wait till i can get it replaced.,1,1
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Professional Looking Gaming Laptop,2018-11-23,"Pros:This laptop is a versatile gaming and office laptop -- powerful specs but doesn't have the obvious marks of a gaming laptop (large heating vents, tacky gaming flair/aesthetics, etc.) so it doubles as a professional laptop quite well if you don't want your rig to scream ""I'm a gamer."" The laptop is quite light relative to other laptops with similar specs, and I've been pretty happy with it so far.","Cons:Heat and noise can be significant, but other than that no real issues.

In practice, though, I found myself rather annoyed at the compromises I was forced to make.1. The screen brightness is only adjustable by hotkey when the management software is open, as is the fan turbo mode. Totally baffled by this decision as all the other hotkeys work fine.2. Keyboard software is clunky and hard to use. Is there really not an option to switch modes or colors on the fly? If there is, it's buried so deep I can't figure out how to do it.3. Battery life is GREAT!......if you take every measure to prolong it. I found myself at 80% after a 1 hour course and I was only browsing the web and typing notes. This was on Power Saving mode with battery saver on, too. On the other hand, I was only able to get 100 minutes of work time as the gpu was constantly eating about 40-50W or so.4. Keyboard layout takes a little getting used to. I've gotten used to it after only 24 hours but I switch keyboards all the time. The main plank is offset to the left to allow room for the num pad, and that's really nice for the programs I use it for, but not so nice when I'm just writing, working, or in otherwise regular use. I either have to twist my wrist or offset the laptop in front of me.5. Unlike the old version, the Gigabyte logo on the back of the screen is not lit by the backlight, however, there is no software control over it either. I'd like to be able to turn it off the save a few extra watts.6. Backlight bleed - now this will vary from unit to unit, but mine had pretty serious bleed along the top and bottom right corners, and mild bleeding along the left edge. Annoying only with videos or programs that have black or other dark colors in these areas, but still would like to see better with a $2000 laptop, especially one that claims to have a calibrated display.7. It's h0t, and l0ud. My unit had the 1070 Max-Q gpu inside, instead of the 1060, but with only a 15-20W difference between the two, this would likely remain the same. While writing, the fans seldom spin up on the normal or gaming fan curves, and never do when on quiet. Under load, however, it is very audible and uncomfortably hot to the touch on the bottom, and it's worse plugged in than on battery, which makes sense as the components are throttled slightly when you're on the go.It's a great laptop, don't get me wrong, but it could be better with just a few tweaks.",1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Built like a tank / All day battery / Powerhouse,2018-11-21,"Pros:- The overall build quality on this machine is impressive. I have owned many high end laptops and this one impresses out of the box- Size and compactness in comparison with the level of components is amazing- Battery life is worthy of a standing ovation. I am glad someone listened and answered the call for a larger battery- Key travel is nice, keys well lit and number pad is in the right spot- RGB lighting on the keyboard is beautiful- PLENTY of connections for everything you need.",Cons:- Speakers are awful. I understand they had to cut corners somewhere and this was obviously the spot- Lots of unwanted programs on initial boot to deal with. I recommend a clean install of OS,"Other Thoughts:I have read the reviews and complaints on this machine but I don't have anything negative to say. This is an excellent machine at a price point that rivals others within this field. I chose this over the MSI because of build quality issues on previous machines I have owned and I am not disappointed. The Aero is simply beautiful and the build is top shelf. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a powerhouse in a small form factor. This fits perfect in my 14"" laptop backpack and I could not be more thrilled.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Affordable entry into portable gaming,2018-11-17,"Pros:+ Keyboard with numpad. The typing experience is nice. Coming from a lenovo I was worried that typing would be difficult due to my love of that keyboard, but the keyboard is nicely laid out and the keys have a nice travel. No complaints+ Set up. I did not notice much bloatware on my set up and did not overly feel that I would need a fresh reinstall of windows+ Battery. 94 watt hours is great for an all day laptop with no need to bring the charger+ price per performance. The 1060 is right in my sweet spot for 1080 gaming, especially with the 144 hz refresh+ build quality","Cons:- I really wish the SSD was nVme, rather than sata. It already has the slot on the motherboard, so it can be done on the motherboard. I understand this probably keeps the price down, but would have been a very nice addition.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this laptop to people that are content with having a little more weight t carry to have an all day battery and solid gaming experience.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Great experience!,2018-11-14,"Pros:- Fast, sleek, and professional-looking- Lightweight","Cons:- Out-of-box experience was sluggish (due to bloatware, immediately perform fresh install of Windows)",Other Thoughts:- I would definitely recommend this product.,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Stands above it's peers but some little details need polishing!,2018-11-13,"Pros:Unboxing - The package arrived in your typical generic shipping box. Inside that box was another brown Gigabyte labelled box where the computer, relatively small power supply and three prong cable, and some printed literature were carefully stored. The computer itself comes in a black cloth sleeve with another piece of the same black cloth placed covering the keyboard and separating it from the screen.Initial Bootup - Upon initial bootup, you have the usual Windows registration process, asking for your name, desired password/pin and local wifi login. Nothing out of the ordinary.The default desktop and computer pleasantly has very little bloatware. There are gigabyte’s own utilities – such as RGB management and driver update manager which are both handy and necessary, as well as  some of the usual free programs and pre-installs, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader and MS Office starter files. I know some users will label these as bloatware but as an office worker, these are likely programs you will download and install anyway as I do. You can always uninstall them as needed. For me in particular, these get a pass.My Initial Impressions - The unit feels very tight, well-built and the metal surfaces cool to the touch. It is surprisingly light for its size and despite having many metal parts. This is especially true compared to other medium sized laptops I’ve used before, such as an (older) Alienware 14 and the (mostly plastic) Asus GL502v. Looking at the high end CPU and GPU specs, this lightness is even more impressive.Though I haven’t had hands-on time with any of the Aero 15x’s new peers – such as the Alienware m15, the MSI GS65 or the Zephryus S – it definitely seems that the tech companies (especially with Nvidia’s Max Q technology and Intel’s 8750H with 6 core / 12 threads) have made quite a jump in performance this generation compared to laptops just one or two generations ago, especially in the thin and light (+ now thin bezels) laptop category.The 15.6” 144 hertz screen is matte finished and is a visual treat. Just moving the mouse around the desktop is noticeably smoother than the usual 60 hertz screens I’ve used. With the IPS display, the (Pantone certified) screen has good off-side viewing angles and the colors and brightness are also noticeably vibrant, even at my usual 50% brightness setting.For me, the other hidden gem is the SD card reader. Gigabyte must have an engineer / designer who is also a photographer, since as far as I know, they are the only company to offer a built-in high speed UHS-II SD card reader. This is especially good for those who shoot RAW format photos or video and need to transfer large numbers of files to the computer for further processing.","Cons:The kinda ""Cons""  - given how impressive the hardware is, I really only have a few very particular nits I can pick, so they aren't CONs per se.Some ""Not Cons,"" just notes:From watching the different reviews on Youtube it seemed that the majority of the test machines had 16gb G. Skill Ripjaw sodimms, but the production / retail unit I received did not. Mine is a Kingston labelled sodimm with unknown specs. Not as cool looking as the Ripjaws but works perfectly fine, so no real issues.The m.2 SSD in my retail unit was a 500gb Transcend unit with a heat / thermal pad attached to the PCB (along with the manufacturer’s label). Gigabyte also included a spare adhesive thermal pad in a plastic bag in case you decide to install a second m.2 drive down the road.The Transcend drive worked for all intents and purposes. The only issue I had with this drive was with its high operating temps. Is it normal or not? I’ve never used a Transcend before, so I’m not sure.At desktop, it was idling at 50 degrees C - no games, no benchmarks running, just Windows 10. For comparison, I cloned a copy of the exact same windows install to a brand new Samsung 970 EVO 1 TB and rebooted and that was operating at 29 degrees C. Both temps were measured by Crystal Disk Info with only one drive installed in the unit, so the higher readings were not the result of heat cross-contamination from multiple drives or anything of the sort. I don’t have any idea why the Transcend was running so hot, but since it came with the computer, I’m keeping it as a spare / not actually running it, so I’m not going to worry about it too much.This is something to consider if you are planning on buying this laptop and using it in its stock configuration.Another nit I had to pick had to do with the Gigabyte software updater - The Gigabyte updater ran and took some time as it worked to update the pre-loaded drivers that shipped with my unit. A good point about the Gigabyte updater is letting you know what the versions numbers are: including the current version number, the latest “official” Gigabyte driver, as well as the latest driver available from the manufacturer. Kudos, Gigabyte, very handy!Everything was looking good and updating at a steady pace - that was until I tried to update the Nvidia driver (via the updater). it tried to install a few times, including rebooting, but could not actually finish. I don't know what was going on. Eventually I just gave up and went to Nvidia.com myself and downloaded the driver from there. Installed the Nvidia.com driver without issue after that.Outside of the heat issue with the stock m.2 SSD, these were really the only other Nits / ""Not Cons"" I could think of.-	The black metal parts are finger-print magnets. If that’s a concern, you can always carry around a towel or put a skin on it – which is what I plan on doing. Not a major issue but for people who are particular about keeping their gear clean, it could be.-	The keyboard is offset to the left due to the inclusion of the numpad much like any desktop keyboard – but since laptop keyboards are much narrower, there’s less room overall and the offset more extreme. You will have to move your right hand / arm further left here than on other non-numpad keyboards or laptops. As an Excel user, I’m glad they did include the numpad, but I can see it having greater negative effect on non-numpad users.-	USB Ports criticism #1. The USB ports are very tight on my unit. Attaching and removing USB devices / cables takes some effort. Maybe it’s the cold weather causing the metal ports to be so tight – or the newness of the unit?-	USB Ports criticism #2. The USB ports shut down at reboot and upon restart your mouse or other attached peripheral might not be recognized until you unplug then plug it back in.","Other Thoughts:This has proven to be a great computer / desktop replacement with just a few minor caveats I've noted above, most of which are just me being nit-picky. Also there may be solutions in the UEFI/Bios that address what I'm noticing (especially the USB stuff), but I'm not sharp enough to find them and make the changes myself.",3,0

There is not a large amount of bloatware which I am very happy with but there is some unnecessary stuff that could be removed. I did end up replacing the trackpad drivers with some different ones which made the trackpad almost perfect. With optimus there are some known issues with mouse cursor freezing when opening programs, but this is a known issue across many computers using optimus, but this is the only way to achieve the ridiculously long battery life. While on intel graphics I can get more than a day of school work done, but then on gaming I just leave it plugged in to game and it performs great. Coming from a 15"" Macbook Pro I was worried about battery life and that is what made me buy this laptop. Overall very happy with the gigabyte laptop.- I give 4 out of 5 eggs because of some minor things that bothered me at first, but I feel as if that is coming from the quality and seamless graphic switching of Apple previously.

Very thin and light for how powerful it is.- Sold chassis with minimal flex.- Good battery life.- Beautiful 144 Hz screen. I do see some back light bleed, but it's only at boot time. Unnoticeable otherwise.- Good keyboard with nice travel.- Good selection of ports, including SD card slot and Ethernet.- Easy access to the internals for upgrades.","Cons:- Needs some tweaks to run at its best (see comments below).- Webcam placement is unfortunate, but I rarely every use it and I like the slim top bezel.- Can run loud, and some machines can benefit from a re-application of thermal paste.- Mediocre trackpad (see below).- Giant, heavy power adapter with no cord management.- Finish of the material inside the letters on the back of the screen is different. A minor annoyance but it does bother me every time I see it.","Other Thoughts:Overall I am very pleased with this laptop, but I would not recommend it to somebody who does not know how or is not willing to take the time to make the tweaks necessary for it to perform at its best. The changes I would recommend are as follows:- Under-volt the CPU. This allows the machine to run cooler. I was able to get a 150 mV under-volt using the Intel XTU utility.- Install the Windows precision trackpad driver. This turns a horrible trackpad into a usable one. Still not as good as Apple trackpads.- Install a dual channel RAM kit. This alone is worth a 10-20% bump in performance. I installed DDR4-2666 CL15. I did need to physically disconnect the battery from the motherboard to get the machine to boot with the new memory.- Install a better M.2 SSD. The one the machine comes with is fairly slow. Thankfully there are two M.2 slots, which makes migrating to a new drive easy. Plus you can keep the one the machine came with as a storage drive.Unlike some people have said, you really don't need to reinstall Windows. There were just a couple Gigabyte apps that I removed because I didn't need them. Use the Gigabyte Smart Update to manage your drivers.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,An amazing laptop.. With some small faults.,2018-10-12,"Pros:The Aero 15x V8 (144hz 1080p) has a beautiful display, and the 144hz is no joke. No stuttering ANYWHERE.The keyboard is great. Very tactile, very responsive (With the exception of the D key. It requires a bit more force than the other keys for some reason, still works great so can't fault it on that one)Battery life is awesome. I can get over 8 hours of use on this laptop in the work setting, although, see note in Cons.Gaming performance is great. Almost always getting the full 144 in older titles. Rocket league runs the full 144 at max settings no drops. And AAA performance is great too. All the tomb raider games run nice and smooth with the settings cranked up high as well.","Cons:After taking some time and reading others reviews, I've realized a couple things:The Keyboard Quality Control needs some work. Almost every laptop reviewed has had some sort of problem with one or multiple keys. Which isn't a good sign.My BIGGEST complaint about this laptop. Is the out of box experience. The windows preinstalled on this laptop is a total disaster, the mouse lags and stutters all over the place. While it's not too time consuming these days, and still not a fun experience, I recommend reinstalling windows day 1.Battery life. Here's an interesting topic, from what I can tell every user has a different profile that they use for power management, which is fine and great. But realistically, the only way you're going to get 8+ hours of this laptop is a couple things. Firstly you'll need to open up Nvidia Control Panel and set the Intel GPU as the default. (DO NOT DISABLE IT IN THE CONTROL PANEL, that causes the GPU to wake randomly and use power, thus higher power draw). Secondly. Set the CPU in the power options to about 35-45% max power. And thirdly. Grab the Intel utility, and undervolt the CPU to -100mv. Then you can easily achieve the 8+ battery life.",Other Thoughts:Overall. I'd give this laptop a 8/10.,2,0

Speakers are easily the weakest point of this laptop, but I don't mind since I use headphones 99% of the time on my computer. Heat is also an issue, but is excusable on a device this thin.

I have experienced no issues with key stuttering as others have, although I really wish that the brightness buttons were giving a keycode instead of tying in directly to Gigabyte's fusion software, forcing you to have one more thing running on the device, and makes it outright impossible to control screen brightness in Linux from the keyboard.The trackpad is just alright. It could have been bigger without affecting the functionality of anything else. Again, you can't disable the trackpad in Linux from the keyboard hotkey, but I don't find this to be as much of an issue, since the trackpad actually works better in Linux than it does in Windows, and with the trackpad being so small, I don't find myself resting my palms on it as much.Thermals: they suck unless the fan is screaming at you, which it will want to do randomly anyways, even when the laptop is idling. This is an issue in both Windows and Linux.Screen: The screen is overall pretty nice, but there is noticeable light bleed on all 4 corners. The colors are accurate, but if you plan on getting more than 2 hours of battery, do not run the screen at full brightness.Overall: The experience is pretty decent, but if Lenovo had made a 1070/1060 max-q thinkpad, then that would be the laptop to go with, as they support all flavors of OS without locking a user into using terrible software that is available exclusively for one equally bad OS.

The battery will easily last the day even with a movie going on in the background. The trackpad can be used to navigate google earth if need be, and the hexa-core paired with the 16gb RAM, 512Gb SSD, and 1070 Max-Q will  mean that you will be booting up, playing, and beating games without making this laptop break a a sweat.

I've been playing Rocket League, State of Decay 2 and Gears of War 4, all run maxed out at 1080p, have to reduce some settings to get 2K to 4K.- Was easy to add a second SSD.","Cons:- Keyboard issues. My E key keeps falling off (I can reattach it, but it never stays on. The keys also seem to be off center? Maybe this is common for this style of laptop, but I find I'm always making typos because I am typing one key to the right. I was told I had to send the laptop away for servicing to fix this, but I am now overseas and wasn't able to do this before I left- Heat. The laptop runs VERY hot to the touch when under load.- Screen backlight bleeding- Half the time when I plug in headphones, the sound will play through the headphones but will still play through the speakers. This is probably a software issue that can be fixed, but not something I wanted to deal with on a new laptop.","Other Thoughts:Time will tell if this turns out to be a good purchase.

Looks cool-RGB keyboard with a solid typing experience,"Cons:-UHD630 iGPU cannot handle 4k resolution properly. Have to overclock it with Intel XTU to avoid laggy windows experience, even though the rest of the hardware is good.","Other Thoughts:Initially using this laptop was a total disappointment. Having spent almost $3k and having major lag and random crashes was just a terrible experience. It was only usable in the High Performance mode, which is not good since I bought a laptop and need the battery to last. I ended up having to do a fresh install of Windows 10, but this still didn't fix the problem. All components were working at their rated speeds, but the laptop stilled lagged bad in normal mode. After more tinkering around, I concluded that it was the integrated graphics that couldn't handle the 4K resolution.I have now owned this laptop for 3 months, and I am loving it! I used Intel XTU to turn up the iGPU multiplier to 12.5x. Also Gigabyte has been updating the firmware for the BIOS as well as updates to their other software on the laptop. Everything is working like a charm now.My only recommendation to those looking to buy this laptop would be to skip the 4K model and stick to the 1080p 144Hz models. The iGPU cannot properly drive it. With the 1070 Max-Q, you definitely can't game in 4K. And I don't think there is much of a difference between 1080 and 4k at this screen size when watching videos. Only people who need this in 4K are content creators.tl;dr Love the laptop, but 1080p version saves $$$ and and the internal hardware can handle it better. Battery will also last longer.",4,0

Coming from a Dell S2716DG, this panel had slightly more bleed in comparison.- Decreased performance while running on battery. CPU clocks down to 1GHz from 3.9GHz on the balanced power setting (using smart manager). On high performance it runs at 3.4GHz (takes a hit on battery life though). I'm not going to need the performance other than at home so it's ok for me.- Keyboard layout is a bit weird but I got used to it in a day- CPU and GPU run hot (90 and 78ish respectively while running forza horizon 3 on ultra). Could potentially cause damage to other components.- Backplate was a pain to pry off (used a credit card and a thin screwdriver to gradually pry it off)- Speakers are trash but who seriously expects good sound quality from a laptop?- Bloatware","Other Thoughts:I was in need of a desktop replacement for college since I didn't want to risk taking my main rig with me and this is my closest bet. It's as powerful as a desktop, it's portable, and it has good battery life. I put a 2TB 860 EVO in the open slot and was only able to afford it because newegg doesn't charge sales tax in my state so I saved a good chunk of money in the process. Knocked off an egg because I'm worried about the longevity of this laptop. While the CPU might be fine running at those temps, I'm not sure if the rest of the components will be able to handle it for 4+ years and I'm sure everyone has heard of Gigabyte's mediocre RMA service. I'm going to undervolt the CPU and get a cooling pad in the future so hopefully it drops the temps a bit. Overall, I like it for its versatility.",0,0

This particular unit has the '5' key stick down, and the '1' key on the numpad not read frequently.-Illumination of keyboard isn't fluent. On all units, the right shift, enter, and tab keys are the worst and quite unattractive. This is ALL units, confirmed from Gigabyte.-Bluetooth and audio driver problems. Will not reconnect to mice, will not play audio or detect audio devices, occasionally will be unable to find bluetooth hardware.-Power issues if adapter is unplugged, computer will become unusable without a powered connection, and cannot be run on battery to complete any tasks. Additionally, reconnecting the power supply often results in a 'plugged in, not charging) error with gradual battery drain.-For some reason USB ports are excessively tight, causing the casing of USB terminals to break off, USB dongles to break (for mice), and USB thumb drives to often strip and become unable to be pushed in...-With 5 re-installations of Windows from Gigabyte Smart Restore and also CLEAN Windows 10 installs from Microsoft, the computer exhibits the same problems.","Other Thoughts:This is my 2nd Aero 15, the first one had a defective keyboard where the 'o' key would register multiple key strokes per single stroke. This unit also has problems with the keyboard. The '5' key sticks down and the '1' key won't read strokes a lot of the time.Additionally (see cons), there are significant hardware malfunctions in the audio, bluetooth and power management. For the first month of ownership I was exchanging technical solutions with Gigabyte, and determined that the drivers they had on they had linked to were incorrect for the hardware, and/or corrupt in more than one instance...We're at a point not where audio works, bluetooth works (but will not automatically connect to mice), but the power management and charging problems remain.The laptop itself is attractive and an idea design for me. However being the 2nd unit and exhibiting the same and more issues than the first, I can't recommend the reliability or quality of this product to anyone.Currently this is unit is outside of the returnable time frame to Newegg and Gigabyte would like me to RMA it. Seeing as how I purchased this for an out of country, on the road, work laptop, that isn't at all a feasible solution. I'll now need to purchase a 3rd laptop and attempt to sell the repaired/replaced laptop. Very frustrating, as I've offered to put through payment for a replacement while this device is repaired and they are unable to process that request.For a machine of this price-point, the quality is of one that should be 1/3rd the price.I'll add that my M17X I retired in favor of this smaller, lighter and travel friendly product gave me no problems over the 6.5 years it served me, and didn't once require a re-installation of Windows 7... We're 2 machines in and a dozen installations of Windows without a working laptop within 3 months... A brilliantly designed computer, yet a complete disaster!",1,0

The screen is just amazing, if you're coming from Mac like me and usually hate the other laptop screens this one is pretty great, bezelless, pantone certified, 144hz, just worth every penny. What made me fall in love with this one is the aesthetics, they aren't gamerish at all, and that's good for me because I hate that black/red stuff. It feels sturdy everywhere but the screen, it's more wobbly than usual but you're supposed to touch the screen to just open and close it, right? So not much of an issue. The battery is almost as good as advertised, it really lasts like 5 hours on average. Overall I think it's a great laptop.","Cons:The keyboard takes some getting used to, I love it visually (The individual RGB is great for learning new hotkeys in programs, that I love) but you need a little more force than usual and some other users report keys repeating, I haven't experienced that. It's HOT literally and figuratively, I've not seen any throttling as some people say, but it does get hot, not where you rest your hands though. The AC adapter is kind of noisy when it's at full capacity, and I got scared at first, I'm waiting to hear from Gigabyte to see if that's normal. Elan driver trackpad kind of sucks, the feel is pretty nice, but meh I usually use it with a mouse.","Other Thoughts:Recommended to former Mac users, also to people who wishes to play games also do some creative work.

This thing isn't packed with RGB or other flashy gimmicks (the keyboard is backlit with RGB LEDs but that's all, and they are 100% customizable). I can use this in a professional environment without drawing any more attention than say a Dell XPS.I can switch from my i7-6800K desktop to this thing and not really notice a difference; it's quite powerful and also lightweight for its size. Really the only thing that's a bit jarring about this thing is firing up applications that utilize hardware acceleration. It seems like Windows stutters pretty hard for a moment before going back to being super fast and responsive, and this is doubly jarring when trying to move the mouse while it's happening. Not enough to shave an egg off for, though.Also, and not a fault of Gigabyte's, but Windows still does a horrible job at scaling. I recommend changing it from the default 125% back down to 100%.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,1,Garbage! the product and the company.,2018-07-13,Pros:-the specs are nice on paper,"Cons:-heats up the the point where it will burn you, which in turn causes it to crash. twice now while playing overwatch, with the laptop on a table, the computer crashed with grey lines flickering across the screen. you can still hear the windows sounds in the back, but the screen goes totally out of commission.-you pretty much HAVE to reinstall windows form scratch when you get this because it's slow as molasses. i researched this and it's not just me. hundreds of owners of this laptop said they had to reinstall the laptop on day 1 to get it to work somewhat OK.-the SSD in this is a very low tier toshiba drive. other companies use Samsung 960/970 EVO equivalents that are 2x faster, use less power and stay cooler.-the laptop lid doesn't stay closed. it flaps around about 1/4 of an inch-keyboard is terrible. easily the worst keyboard i've ever used, and my laptop was a macbook with the butterfly keys, which says a lot!","Other Thoughts:-i thought this may be a cheaper substitute for the razer blade 15. nope. i was wrong. if gigabyte wants 2500 for this junk, then the blade 15 should be like 4000.-on a related note, i sent back a faulty Gigabyte Z370 motherboard TWICE to RMA due to bad PCI E lanes. regardless of which GPU i put in it, i get stutters and frame drops. they sent it back both times without fixing it. the reason i know it's the board and not something else is because i replaced it with an AsRock board and now everything is perfect. the gigabyte techs are too dumb to understand the problem and test for dropped frames. they just see a video signal and automatically think it works. because of that, i'm not going to gamble whether or not they will actually honor the warranty on this hunk of junk if it breaks.I sending this pile of garbage back and putting the bad gigabyte motherboard on fleabay. never going back or recommending this worthless brand again.",1,4
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Great Laptop!,2018-07-13,"Pros:- The weight is light, very good for mobile use (duh, it's a laptop).- The look and feel is slick and beautiful: The screen displays beautiful colors and smooth, unjagged lines.- For what it is as a gaming laptop, it does it's job. Now of course it cannot beat the potentials of desktop gaming but for the hardware and price, this in my opinion would be the best if you are looking into a little laptop gaming and perhaps other work like video editing or...whatever you can use with a laptop.- Start-up is incredibly fast due to the SSD-Everything moves and looks smooth because of the 144 Hz refresh rate.- It's quiet when I game or do anything else, even if the battery is on performance mode.","Cons:- Can't really think of any, Fallout 4 won't run 60 fps or above because, again, it's a gaming laptop with an integrated GTX 1070, and honestly: cause it's Fallout, so of course it won't run well or as well.","Other Thoughts:For those wanting a good idea of what I use it for in comparison to my rating and praise of the product, so that way they can judge if they should take my review into consideration:I'm not entirely computer part savvy or gaming tech savvy as my friends are. Which I've used their opinions for making a sound purchase for what I want to do. My friend recommended me this for gaming, video editing, and not just that but to be able to do that anywhere I could should I travel from state to state or country to country if that becomes a situation. This laptop would last me a good while considering I use it for some gaming, leisurely surfing the web, multi-tasking with my desktop computer, and anything menial.If you want to take your time on a decision, that's completely fine. If you have the money and want to try it, you can. You can always send it back if it isn't what you thought (but I can understand time being a factor you do not want to waste). I'm just a guy working 40 hours a week, I like to game, I like to make videos if I have the time, I read history books on my time, I'm joining the Marines (i.e the travel part). The laptop is beautiful, it looks beautiful and it preforms beautifully, it isn't alienware that charges you more than for whats in it, I honestly love it.Also I'm doing this review for the $20 Steam Gift Card but I at least want to make this review meaningful XD.",0,0

Although a very minimal issue, the typing and usage of the keyboard feels hard to the touch and feels slightly uncomfortable.","Other Thoughts:Would definitely recommend, even if it is slightly expensive!",0,1
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,"Not cheap, but you get what you pay for",2018-06-30,Pros:- Excellent performance! The 8th gen hex core CPU coupled with Nvidia's GTX 1070 Max-Q offer some pretty powerful specs in a laptop as thin as the Aero 15X- Stylish design- Solid build quality- 144hz display is quite nice- Very slim bezels,"Cons:- Webcam is in an awful position (nostril shots), but seeing as I rarely use the webcam it isn't a big deal- Fans can get quite loud under heavy loads, although fan curves can be tweaked- Cooling could be better (although it is acceptable for a thin laptop)","Other Thoughts:Although I haven't had the opportunity to play around with MSI's new thin and light laptop they just released, I opted for the Gigabyte Aero 15X because I personally liked the design a tad bit more, as well as their keyboard layout, but the most important factor in choosing the Aero15X over MSI's new laptop was expandability. If I want to replace or add new RAM sticks, or new SSDs, it's much easier to do with the Aero15X, and since I'm dropping 2 grand on a laptop, that's a must for me.Note - When I first got this laptop, I noticed that CPU temps would reach up to 90+ degrees Celsius under heavy load, which, coming from a desktop, felt unacceptable to me. This was easily fixed however by adjusting Windows power settings to not use 100% of the CPU 24/7, as it was defaulting to that for some reason. My temps now rarely go past 80 degrees Celsius when gaming, and usually hover between 65-75 degrees Celsius when gaming.",0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Beautiful computer with some minor inconveniences,2018-06-21,"Pros:This laptop feels very well built, the screen is gorgeous to look at, and the hardware is top notch. It just feels like a very premium device, there's no other way to describe it. The keyboard is very pleasant to type on (much better than my last year XPS 15) and the RGB lighting on it is fun to play with, if you're into that. The battery life is what I'd consider good, but falls a bit short of the 8 hours I expected, averaging about 6 for me. I've installed Arch Linux onto this laptop, and after alot of fiddling (more on that later) it works like a charm.  The laptop temperatures never went above 90 degrees, and for a laptop of this size I think that's great.","Cons:Installing Linux onto this computer was a chore that took about a week for me to get through. First, there's the issue of the laptop freezing randomly (especially when querying for PCIe devices) unless a certain kernel parameter was set. Then, setting up bumblebee and bbswitch was filled with trial and error, albeit it was my first time setting it up, so maybe it wasn't the computers fault. The FN keys don't get recognized in Linux, so I am forced to use a software solution for changing brightness and sound.While the keyboard generally is very pleasant to type on, the 'X' key requires a lot more force to press at times. I've somewhat got used to this, but this is the issue that takes this laptop from 5 eggs to 4 for me. Emacs users beware.Finally, the RGB on the right Shift key is very bad/weak. I really couldn't care less, but some people might be bothered by it.","Other Thoughts:This is a beautiful laptop with an amazing screen and great internals. It's both rugged and sleek at the same time, and that's what I love about it. If the 'X' key worked properly, this would be the perfect laptop for me.",1,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,3,unstable in linux; not great hardware for the price; ended up returning,2018-06-16,"Pros:- surprisingly thin; I didn't really understand the dimensions properly until I had it in front of my face, and I am very pleased.- fantastic performance- plays Dota 2 at 4K high (not max) quality 60 FPS- same specs as 2018 razer blade at a lower price and earlier ship date- the screen is very vibrant; huge difference comparing other laptops with inferior display technology side-by-side","Cons:- stock Windows installation is full of bloatware (candy crush and redundant gigabyte-branded widgets for things like volume indication); slow (things like game installation stalls), stutters (mouse input jumps, applications visually hang), completely unusable- this isn't a hardware problem, just be prepared to not be able to use the laptop out of the box, and have your own installation media ready- gigabyte could make the out of box experience better if they provided vanilla unmodified Windows and unbranded upstream drivers- maximum fan speed is very loud; the hardware speed control is too aggressive, and will increase fan speed just on things like youtube- I never bothered to look at why, but I experienced segfaults and crashes (everything from firefox to emacs to docker) on linux 4.16 + nvidia 396.24, and I've never seen this behavior on other hardware- the keyboard is fairly bad; key activation happens after the click point, so you'll end up bottoming out all the time in order to reliably press the keys.- can't emphasize how bad the keyboard is; I'm sure it's fine for ""gaming"", but my fingers hurt typing regular text/paragraphs/code on it.- the UEFI was buggy; refused to load systemd-boot from nvme, despite being correctly installed/configured (the same binary worked from USB)Despite having used NVIDIA-prime/optimus on Linux successfully in the past, I feel that it's not worth it anymore, particularly now that the amdgpu driver exists, and Vega M GL/GH support got merged in kernel 4.17.","Other Thoughts:- attempting to load nouveau causes odd lockups and hanging; you'll need to explicitly blacklist it- came with a single 16GB DIMM, and it has two slots; convenient for upgrading- thought some of the online pictures looked a little odd, especially the camera location, but it definitely looks fine in person; I like the bezel- limited keyboard RGB controls are in hardware; key combo works like regular backlight control- charging the laptop over USB-C doesn't work (as expected) unlike some other recent dell laptops; this would have been nice, but not something I really care about greatly- some people didn't like the touchpad; I think it's completely fine, better than most lenovo touchpads that I usually use.

Part of this frustration is that you can't tell when the touchpad is clicking and partly I thought my touchpad was broken.  I also found that in other windows it clicks randomly while I am typing which makes me type in wrong fields and hope there are no keyboard shortcuts that cause things to get moved, archived, or deleted.All in all, I do not regret this purchase.

The screen, keyboard and overall design are great. I think Gigabyte rushed these first batch of laptops out without getting them fully tested and the software sorted. I've gone through 2 bios updates so far plus dozens of other driver updates out of the box. I get that these machines are complex and expensive, I just didn't think I'd need to be such an advanced user to get the basic expectations I had out of it. I am disappointed overall, but the laptop does work awesome when the issues aren't presenting themselves. I just never know when that is, which means it's not going to be a very reliable work computer. I originally purchased a Dell XPS 15 with a GTX 1050, which could run Windows MR but not well enough to really use. That was a stable platform though compared to this. I'd try the MSI or Asus equivalents before this one if I were to do this again.

When I first received the laptop I tried to uninstall some of the bloatware, but this caused my laptop to restart a multitude of times with windows blue screens throughout.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,1,Be careful - Blue screens,2018-06-08,Pros:Form factor good; battery life as well.  Do not have enough up-time to really test 4K,"Cons:multiple blue screens, either display failure or device failure messages hence not able to test out rest of laptop.  Tech support is only via web site that goes to Taiwan with multiple day delay response (and little help besides try recovering Windows).  Think this one is going back.",Other Thoughts:Will be reading other reviews; maybe got a lemon.,5,1
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,1,So slow,2018-06-08,Pros:- Beautiful screen- Didn't test the battery yet,"Cons:I reinstalled windows and downloaded all software from GIGABYTE website to reinstall the whole laptop, but it is very slow. I had a 7700hd Asus laptop with GTX 1060 and 16G memory, and I tried to launch the same app at the same time, Aero 15X just get ripped by my Asus. I bought it because I want to work in the cafeteria, but when I launch the example project in Unreal Engine when plugged in, I lost frame for half of the time? The GPU only uses 25% to 30% of its power and won't go more. So disappointed. And in the power management setting of windows, no fully automatic control of battery and performance. For example, when I go out, I want my CPU run at a lower frequency, and it only turbos to 3.9ghz when I launch the app or do anything that needed CPU power, but it either stayed at 3.9ghz, consuming a lot of battery or stayed at 1.9ghz, slowing my laptop down.",Other Thoughts:I am going to try dual channel to see if it helps.,5,2
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Exactly what I  was looking for.,2018-06-07,Pros:I started looking into a Max-Q style laptop to replace my old HP laptop since the screen hinges had started breaking.This laptops size and power combination is great and exactly what I was looking for. Extremely portable and powerful. It is able to play any of the games that I enjoy at high or ultra settings easily.,Cons:For its size its a bit heavy... If that is really a con. Price is a bit higher than I had planned to spend but is pretty much the norm for a laptop with its specs in the Max-Q style.,,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,,2018-06-07,Pros:- powerful laptop in a tiny package- light weight- bezel-less display,Cons:- keyboard manufacturing quality can be improved; some keys require a hard-press to register; Google keyboard issues for the Aero 15 before buying- coil whine can be heard when the laptop is idle and plugged-in,Other Thoughts:- expected higher manufacturing quality for a laptop of this price,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Great gaming laptop for the money,2018-06-05,Pros:-Easy to setup-Beautiful display-Fast as heck,Cons:-camera placement - I won't be using it so doesn't affect my rating of the overall product.,Other Thoughts:Would recommend for anyone in the market for a really good gaming pc,0,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Gigabyte Aero15X,2018-06-05,Pros:I've owned many laptops including Macs. This laptop so far is incredible and simply the best one I've ever owned. I mainly bought it for mobile gaming and it crushes all the games I play. I also need it for school and is sharp looking in it's all black casing. Not gaming flashy!!,Cons:So far none really other than I can't get an answer from Gigabyte if I upgrade the ram and M.2 on my own will it render the warranty void.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this product.,0,0

Maybe it's my OCD, but it bothers me a lot.Mouse pad Elan and is just not as precise as a windows precision. Not too bad but you can tell the difference while using it.Most ports are too  tight, trying to plug in a USB device requires you to hold the laptop down.Laptop kept shutting down on me randomly due to software issues.",Other Thoughts:Overall this is an extremely well built laptop with all the bells and whistles you can ask for. I really like using it except for the problems I mentioned. Maybe it's an isolated incident.  But I definitely recommend it!,1,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,"Almost perfect, requires hardware/software tweaking for best experience.",2018-05-28,"Pros:-The overall specs are insane and the laptop is blazing fast.-Build quality is amazing, nothing feels loose or cheap. The overall feel of this laptop is astounding, you won't know until you have one in your hands. It feels very dense and solid.-Surprised by the quality of the touch-pad, need to install Windows Precision drivers to get best of it.-Keyboard is a pro for me, but some people make not like have hard you have to press.-The monitor I got was perfect, no bleeding issues as some people have been getting.-Manual Fan control through Fn keys.","Cons:-Camera is in a weird place, but not really that big a deal-The major concern I have with this laptop is the heating, as with any laptop this small yet this powerful. People have been having success re-pasting the CPU/GPU with Grizzly's Liquid Metal. I have not tried this yet, and I can confirm it will void your warranty. However the temperature drop is phenomenal with some people going as low as 23 deg Celsius on load.-Fans can be understandably very loud.-Gigabyte needs to perfect the drivers on basically all the components of this device. It would be great if their software was just as good as their hardware.","Other Thoughts:-Speakers are a bit weak, but I didn't put it as a con because I can still hear people talking very clearly. It's definitely geared more towards utility than leisure.-If you are tech savvy and capable of dealing with some of the issues present with the laptop, then I think this may be one of the best laptops every to be available my human kind. It has it all with built in a sleek and sturdy package. For everyone else I suggest waiting until Gigabyte fixes some of issues in a later model.-Overall I'm very happy with my purchase primarily because I also know that I will eventually modify this laptop perfect it's build. Once again, its really not recommended to purchase this laptop unless you're at least well enough capable of modifying drivers/tweaking power mode/dealing with minor software issues. I'm not going to re-paste the laptop until I am certain that there are not major issues with it.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,1,Nice Laptop but Gigabyte does not stand behind their products,2018-05-25,Pros:Everything except the screen,Cons:RMA Process - Pray you never have to deal with them if something goes wrong.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this laptop and could not be more disappointed. The screen has major light bleed and a weird discoloration in the top right 25% of the screen. It's like something is pressing against the screen behind the bezel. Gigabyte agreed to RMA the laptop only to keep it for three weeks without contacting me back. After several phone calls, they finally told me it was within factory tolerances. The recommended returning it to where I bought it, or I could PAY to have it REPAIRED.  Total run around. If you buy one of these, I hope you don't have an issue because they do not stand behind their products.﻿",7,2
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,One of the Best Gaming Thin And Lights,2018-05-25,"Pros:* Battery. Seriously, the battery is massive in this.* Although currently DRAM is expensive, it's nice that they have an open slot for an additional 16GBs instead of filling them with two 8GBs* Two M.2 slots!* Super thin bezels!* The laptop is just all around a solid performer, but the notes above I believe set it apart from it's competition.",Cons:* PC not only came with bloatware but the Windows install was corrupted and certain things wouldn't retain setting changes. I had to do a clean install. I guess this is pretty normal for anything prebuilt anymore though.* Power brick is pretty big and they currently do not have the slimmer type with a USB port. I was asked to check back in later when I asked Gigabyte support* While completely usable I am not a huge fan of the touchpad.,"Other Thoughts:* I do not consider the webcam placement to be a con but anyone who would use it regularly may hate it.I only thing I believe this laptop does better than everyone else is the battery. Everything else will be hit or miss depending on the features and price you're looking for. But unless something specifically looks unreasonable, you won't go wrong picking this laptop up. Every device will have its own hiccup's, and I feel that the good strongly outweighs the bad here. I am a huge fan of this laptop and recommend it to everyone looking for a high performance and thin laptop that doesn't need tablet functionality.",1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,"Great Hardware, pretty average software",2018-05-23,Pros:-Beautiful laptop and build quality-Reasonably light-Good battery life,Cons:-Software included is out of date and very buggy-Nothing really works right out of the box,"Other Thoughts:My very first impressions of this laptop were negative. It was full of bloatware and suffered from frequent lag and stuttering issues whenever display properties were accessed. Some research revealed that this was an issue with NVIDIA's Optimus technology, which switches on the fly between intel and NVidia graphics in order to preserve battery life. I erased everything and started with a fresh Windows 10 install, and then manually updated each and every driver. Fast forward a few hours later and the computer is now great and very enjoyable to use. It's a shame that Gigabyte doesn't test their products themselves before selling them. Otherwise this would have been a perfect purchase.",2,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,One of the nicest laptops I've owned,2018-05-22,Pros:-Good GPU-Hexacore-Colorful keyboard lighting options-Hexacore-Lightweight (for what it is) and quite portable-Screen reasonably accurate,"Cons:-At purchase only single core memory (one 16GB stick). The trade off is if they used 2x 8GB sticks you'd end up possibly replacing to upgrade.-Speakers are only 'OK' -- very little bass and too quiet.-Power brick is just that, a brick.-No USB option port on charger any more",Other Thoughts:-Decent warranty-Screen could have additional options beyond accuracy such as vibrant.,2,0

I can pull this out during a meeting and feel right at home with the Mac users-Games like a champ.. The 1070MQ stands right up there with my full 1070.-Super fast after a clean Windows 10 install","Cons:-Runs hot, out the box I was getting 90c CPU-GPU... I used ThrottleStop, undervolted to -125v and was able to lower the CPU to around 81-87c under full load.. The GPU however never goes under 90c under demanding load.. I've tried every possible fan curve. The good news is neither CPU/GPU ever break 90c...-Single channel memory.. I've purchased a stick of RAM",Other Thoughts:I'd like to know if I can crack this thing open and repaste it; while still being under warranty with Gigabyte.

Its a must for laptops as strong as this- Great battery life,"Cons:- Startup was a bit annoying, but I guess its pretty normal for most laptops- The track pad needs work. For a laptop as good as this, it should be better- The placement of the camera is a bit bad (it looks up your nose), but for me its not a big deal since I don't use it much","Other Thoughts:While the laptop is a bit pricey, I think its the best you can get right now, and would definitely recommend it",1,0

Install both, and after initial setup and clone.  System of still unstable or had its quirks.  So i started all over and installed a fresh copy of window along with drives and software from website waiting til the end to install intel HD drivers first and then nvidia drivers and everything went perfect.  After that the laptop has worked flawlessly.  It is true that if you do a clean install everything works as it should.  Love the laptop especially the battery life.  Right now I am writing this review with a full battery surfing the web and I am at 8 hr 41 mins.  I do a lot of flash based games and I still get 7 hrs of battery life.  The 1060 is only 10-15% slower in SOME games but it works buttery smooth on games like doom and starcraft and racing games.  I highly recommend this laptop and coming from a person that gets a laptop almost every year, this one maybe a keeper this time.  I am very happy with it after the clean install.  On another note all touchpad issues were fixed once the clean install was done.  I did have issues before that, stuttering and hang but these were eliminated after clean install.  Hope this helps.  Dont let the backlight bleed or touchpad issues sway you.  Get this laptop do a clean install and it will be the best laptop you have ever owned.",3,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Finally a laptop that ticks as many boxes as possible,2018-05-06,"Pros:- Very sleek design, love the small bezels. Finally a gaming laptop that looks less flashy- 1080p with 15"" is the perfect combo to play game with highest settings, no need for 4K- 144Ghz IPS screen is rather beautiful with good color configuration- Good size SSD, no messing with secondary mechanical drive- Great graphic card (1070 is the best compromise between price/performance)- Love optimus that auto switch between Intel GPU and Nvidia to reduce power consumption- Very good battery size","Cons:- Poor webcam placement and quality as it does not support Windows Hello- Poor audio with no bass (a laptop of this price and gaming oriented should not compromise on audio: yes you can use headphones but it is much more comfortable to not wear anything at home and not have to hook on any external speakers)- Gets very noisy (using processor underclock - as it is overkill for most games today - and good thermal paste, people were able to reduce the noise. Again good thermal paste and automatic underclock should have been built-in at such a price tag)- No dual channel RAM installed (heard it gives up to 10% boost so should have been built-in)- Keyboard layout is unatural, still adjusting due to very little space between keys (perhaps best not to cram a numpad on such a narrow laptop)- Why such large bezel on the bottom of the screen with a huge frontal logo? Best to have as little bezel as possible.- Gigabyte apps are very ugly and don't adhere to Windows design. Functional (although smart update downloads really slow) but a real eye sore",,2,0

One is for the trashware included, i know i can uninstall most of it but if manufacture's software managed to alow down the performance without a significant gain in user's experience then it will be reflected on product. Second star becuase my laptop had a small indentation in the middle of the top of the screen. i think casual pressure on it can cuase dent if u forgot small objects in yourbackpack. i stored my laptop sepeartely  and the powerbrick is in a seperate compartment. i will try to contact gigabyte for potential resolution but the honey moon phase is out now u have a nice laptop with visible dent",3,3

Might as well remove the camera and put logo on back.- Large bottom bezels that are distracting.- Trackpad. Probably a Windows issue, but nothing beats Mac.- I rather have more space for keys instead of trying to fit a full size numpad. Why put a full size one on such a compact design?","Other Thoughts:Cons are most nitpicks though. I am so excited about how Gigabyte will improve on this model.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,3,Mostly good... maybe?,2018-05-02,"Pros:- The 1070 is no joke.  Runs games great.  A bonus for me is that in the gigabyte software setting the fan speed will throttle the gaming.  So if you set the fans to ""quiet"" they will remain quiet at the cost of performance.  Which is great when you are trying to play something that doesn't need all the power and you need to be quiet.- The screen is fantastic.  Some IPS backlight issues, not as good as my razer 14"", but the no bezel and the 144hz is a great combo.  Overall I'm very pleased.- 6 cores and 16gb of ram.  Really is a power house.- INSANE battery life.- Good wifi performance","Cons:- Some of the keys on the keyboard don't register unless you push them down far past their click point.  It's really frustrating on the F10 and left CTRL keys in particular.  Also the right shift key doesn't light up very well.  Overall I like the feel of the keys and the layout but I just can't get over having to SMASH the F10 key.- Trackpad.  It's average, which would be OK on a $400 laptop.  But this isn't a $400 laptop.  So that makes this actually worse.","Other Thoughts:- Right now the keyboard is frustrating enough that I might return or exchange it.  I've been coding on it a few days and it just keeps giving me issues.  You can't have a great laptop if you can't type on it.-  I'm not used to the AC adapter plug on the right.-  The ""smart update"" application downloads at a snails pace",12,0

For me, this is the only negative I can find. It's only visible on a black background at med-high brightness.- During the Ghost Recon play mentioned above, the fans really do kick on and make some noise. I know this has been mentioned before, but in my case even with the fans ramped up it didn't bother me while wearing headphones.","Other Thoughts:Overall the laptop is amazing and I'm very happy with my purchase. I read a lot about the heat being a problem causing throttling and possibly lowering the lifetime of the components. While I share the concern, I also feel a little more confident with the purchase because of the 2 year warranty.I bought this laptop primarily for gaming but also for use in the classroom environment. I'm more then satisfied this laptop will meet both of my demands over the next few years until I upgrade again. If you are on the fence, I say go for it if you have the budget.",1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Great new candidate for top performing laptop in 2018,2018-04-29,Pros:-Great new processor.-keyboard feels good to type on.-Screen is great.-Battery life and build quality are what separates this laptop from all of the others (Long battery and easy to take apart and add extra storage/ram at a later date without taking apart the whole computer).,Cons:-Didn't like the fact that American customers got free headphones if you pre-ordered and Canadians got the shaft.-Expensive but not sure if the price tag truly blows away cheaper competitors.-The trackpad is awful. I bought a wireless mouse a few days later and am better for it.-Camera for most others. It wasn't really a deal breaker for myself.,Other Thoughts:I would definitely look at buying this laptop.

Probably don't need to add to this, but for gaming laptops, the battery life is unparalleled.- Card Reader, for anyone who does productivity work with video/photos, the speed is fantastic.- Build Quality.  The construction on this device is near Apple quality.","Cons:- Collects a lot of fingerprints (but basically everything does these days)- Touchpad is rough, but windows precision drivers help.","Other Thoughts:Worth every penny.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Near Perfect Laptop,2018-04-23,"Pros:-Screen: The slim bezel screen is spectacular. At first I was a bit hesitant giving up my surfacebook's pixelsense touchscreen. The glossy glass was really pretty. But then I realized I NEVER use the touchscreen on a laptop and having the real estate the Aero offers is definitely the better tradeoff.-Spcs: The guts in this kit are incredible. I can run all my favorite games (Battlefront, Civ 6, Stellaris, Mass Effect) on max settings and it works just fine. I've heard it is easy to upgrade the hard drive and memory too if you need it.-Ports: Lots of connection points on this thing. Best part is the thunderbolt 3. Charge my computer AND connect my peripherals?! Yes Please!-Style: It may not seem like much but that's the best part. Though I am a gamer I don't like all the fan fare that comes with most gaming laptops. I totally love the idea of playing my favorite AAA title and the 10 minutes later loading up the powerpoint for work and heading into the fray of a board meeting. That is probably the biggest takeout and my favorite perk of this machine.","Cons:-Trackpad. Plain and simple- it isn't very good. Luckily I'll be using a mouse most of the time so that's alright but there are some serious issues with the lag and two+ finger actions. I've heard replacing the driver with native windows makes it a lot better so I'll be trying that soon.-Accessories! So this may seem like a silly ""con"" but I wish there were some accessories custom built to this laptop's dimensions. I'm talking easily available skins, cases, and other protective gear. Macs and Surfaces benefit from a mass audience so they get a lot of love from 3rd party accessory makers and I just wish there was some stylish way of protecting my new investment that didn't take the form of a generic oversized sleeve...",Other Thoughts:-I would definitely recommend this product. If everyone had one of these laptops maybe they would make a good form fitting case for it! You know like out of real leather with all the port cut outs and everything.-I also wish that gigabyte made a custom thunderbolt dock for this machine. There are a couple 3rd party options for docks out in the wild but most are designed for Macs and they get pretty pricey. If I'm going to drop $300 on a thunderbolt dock it would be great if it matched in both design and hardware the laptop it was connecting to. This seems like a realistic request considering this machine is going to be sitting on a lot of designer and engineer workstations.,0,1

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Best Professional Gaming Laptop,2018-04-22,Pros:- Raid 0 support. Currently running two Samsung 960 Pro NVMe 512GB for a 1TB combined drive.- Very nice build quality. Its 90% the quality of a MacBook.- Great keyboard feel.- Getting 55-60 FPS in PUBG with everything on ultra and screen sale at 120 with max draw distance. (using Vsync)- Supports TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for those who might want to put their corporate image on it.- I have no problems opening this is front of the clients I consult for. Very professional.- Great Screen. Colors look great.- Easy to remove case to upgrade components. Just make sure you have a T6 driver.- Comes with one 16GB ram stick. This means you can just buy a second 16GB ram stick to get to 32GB.- Removable WiFi/Bluetooth dongle should you need to upgrade down the road for wireless AD.- Has light sensor so you can use auto brightness. Its nice when moving inside/outside and though different rooms.- Battery like a MacBook. I can make it though a normal 8+ hour work day without fighting for the one seat in the board room which has access to a plug.,Cons:- Track Pad Drivers are really bad. They lag big time. You can google how to change them to windows precision and that fixes the problem- The speakers are not loud enough. With the fans going 100% its hard to hear PUBG. You will need headphones.- You must download the Nvidia drivers from Gigabyte not Nvidia. They are custom so if you download straight from Nvidia they will not install.,"Other Thoughts:I'm converting from a 2015 MacBook Pro. Long story short, I don't miss my MacBook.Reinstalling Windows: After reinstalling windows I noticed the Nvidia GPU would not turn on for games. You must download the Intel Graphics drivers from Gigabyte after reinstalling windows in addition to the Nvidia driver. The Intel driver is how the computer determines if the Nvida GPU needs to kick in for the task/game. You can also right click any file and say run with dedicated GPU if it starts with the Intel Graphics card. I found myself needing to do this for older games.Raid Setup: If you do the raid 0 you will need to go into the BIOS and select the Intel RST with Optane support under SATA type. Then save and exit. Then go to the bios and create the raid disk. Then you will need to go to Intel's site and download f6flpy-x64.zip file and exact this onto the USB flash drive you will be using to install windows. Then when installing windows you won't see the drive but click ""locate drivers"" and pick the folder. Then windows will see the disk after it loads the drivers you put on the flash drive. I spent a few hours on this and i'm hopeful this info might save others time.",29,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,"One of the few gaming laptops that doesn't scream ""gaming"" at people",2018-04-22,"Pros:- A lot of power in a small package- Build quality is great- Super thin bezel- Full keyboard + numpad with RGB lighting so it doesn't feel too corporate- Plentiful I/O (Thunderbolt 3 ftw)- Finally, a 144hz screen is paired with the 1070 MQ- Did I mention that it's a 15.6in laptop with a chassis of a 14in?","Cons:- Trackpad uses Elan driver. You could get a precision driver for this, though- The headphone jack doesn't work with Gigabyte's audio driver unless you get a driver from Realtek's website- Smart Manager doesn't save charging policy; I have to set it again every time- Camera placement is not ideal; it looks up your nose","Other Thoughts:- A powerful gaming notebook that can also be used as a laptop for work.- Could be better, but the manufacturer did their best and I'm satisfied with the product.",1,0
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Best On The Market Right Now...But Could Be Better with Quality RAM and SSD,2018-04-22,"Pros:+ 1080p 144hz BEAUTIFUL Pantone certified display+ Great build quality+ 6-Core i7+1070ish performance+ Thin (NOT Light, which is good!)+ Great Battery life+ Full num pad+ Nice RGBs in the keyboard","Cons:- No-name ""V-Color"" RAM that has a CL of 19 - Its junk and you need to just buy 2x new modules if you want 32 GB- Toshiba SSD that is about 15% slower than the OEM Samsung equivalent at the same market price- Mushy keys (MSI does do this better)- Up-nose camera angle- Bloatware - its not bad, but please just stop including it","Other Thoughts:Overall this is a GREAT laptop.  The good news is that everything that you cannot upgrade is all top-of-the line and is of great quality.  The bad news is that the RAM, and less so the SSD, are low quality.  The RAM is a 16 GB module of ""V-Color"" ram with a CL of 19 - that's the worst CL you can get in this spec of memory.   All the review models had G-skill and that was a factor in me buying this model.  I do a lot of virtualization on the road for work and 32GB is very nice to have - with a good module from G-Skill I could just by another for about $180 and be good to go. Now I need to spend the money on a whole 32GB kit at about $350 - this effectively makes the Aero 15x cost $170 ($350-$180) MORE than I was planning on and that I had been led to believe it would.The SSD is a Toshiba OEM SSD and is not bad; however, the Samsung equivalent is about 15% quicker.  I don't know what the costs to Gigabyte would have been, but the prices are comparable on 3rd party sites.  You most certainly don't have to replace the SSD (like you MUST with the RAM), but having a better quality drive from the start would have been preferred.  I ended up buying one of the 960 Evo OEM equivalents and put that in the second slot and then cloned everything over.  The original drive is now used for mass storage.Overall, just buy it knowing that you will need to spend $180 at a minimum to correct for some moderate oversights on Gigabyte's part.",3,1
GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Great after a bit of setup,2018-04-21,"Pros:+The screen is great, I really thought the matte cover would screw it up but it didn't.+144Hz at 3ms response (give or take). This screen is seriously great (yeah I would love a QHD option though).+The 16 Gb of RAM is great and lets me run my VMs all the time for projects+GTX 1070 can play pretty much everything I want without issues (while connected to power of course, you suffer performance hit on battery but that is expected and not the hardware's fault it just doesn't have the juice the chips need)+Great _feeling_ trackpad+Great tactile feel on the keys (might fatigue some people but I type on Cherry MX Blue's all day pretty much every day)+Per Key RGB lighting. You can be as bland or unique as you want and it seems to be stored in some sort of hardware memory instead of tied to software. This means you still have all colors during boot.+ FORM FACTOR. This thing is slim! It weighs only something like 4.5 pounds so it is super portable which I absolutely love. It also does not look obnoxious and in your face like other gaming laptops such as those made by Alienware, MSI (excepting the GS65), and ASUS ROG. You can pull this laptop out without getting dirty looks.","Cons:-The default touchpad drivers. The ELAN drivers this thing comes with are hot garbage. No gestures, awful multitouch support, weird precision. This can be fixed though (see below in Other).-NUMPAD! I know this is more of a personal gripe but I absolutely despise having number pads on laptops. They are useless to almost everyone buying a gaming laptop and offset the keyboard which makes it more difficult to get used to. I would havep preferred some macro keys or something-No discernible media keys (aside from volume). I haven't played with it too much but maybe some of the other keys can be rebound to perform the multimedia functions but the fact there aren't dedicated keys really sucks.-Single channel ram. It is great to have 16 Gb and most people probably won't use applications with a noticeable hit to performance but it costs an arm and a leg right now if you want to add a matching stick of 16 Gb DDR4-2666 on top of the arm and leg you paid for the device (being $200 more than it's main competitor right now, the MSI GS65)-Bloatware. Gigabyte, like pretty much everyone else, puts a fair bit of junk onto the machine that you will almost certainly want to reset the OS. This means you will basically set up the device twice. This shouldn't still be common practice in 2018 but it unfortunately is.-One last minor gripe is the backup drivers and OS being a DISC. This machine has no disk drive so to even use the provided software on your $2300 laptop should the need arise you must go out and buy a USB disk drive (unless you happen to have one laying around).","Other Thoughts:Fixing the drivers:The trackpad is done wrong by the driver as it limits the pads potential (which sucks because the trackpad is quite nice). Being that I do not know the link policy for Newegg, I would highly recommend searching up ""Upgrading your Trackpad for FREE"" by Dave Lee. There are better drivers out there that enable things like better multitouch, more accurate tracking, and most importantly GESTURES.Fixing the inability to click and type at the same time:While it is not ideal to play games with the trackpad, it might be something you want to do every now and then. The default driver enables a ""Palm Rejection"" feature for the trackpad. This features is basically just ""If a key is pressed, add a huge delay to the click"" effectively making it impossible to play games with the trackpad. (you can move and look around but have to stop pressing any keys completely to click). This _only_ affects the trackpad and luckily can be turned off. Open Windows Settings (Windows + i) then go to Devices -> Touchpad. On the right hand side of the screen you should see a rather small option that says Related Settings: Additional Settings. Click that. In the new Mouse Properties window: Click the ELAN tab, then find options and click that. Look for the Palm Rejection setting and either disable it (recommended) or lower the delay as far as you like (more delay means less click).OVERALL THOUGHTS:Great, solid feeling laptop with an amazing screen and some pretty sweet hardware. I would have loved to have a fingerprint scanner but thats pretty minor. The only major gripe I have is the number pad which makes getting used to the keyboard exceptionally annoying. I would probably call this more of a 4.5/5 but have to do 4 since thats not an option.",1,1

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,4,Great on paper. Good so far.,2018-04-21,"Pros:Specs are just what I was looking for. New 8th gen CPU? Check. GTX 1070 (max Q)? Check. High refresh rate screen? Check. Half the size of my old alienware and twice as subtle? Check and check. After just a day with the device, I can already tell I made the right decision. The couple games I've tested so far ran smooth as silk. I really look forward to using this everyday for a long while to come.","Cons:As for cons: The backlighting on the right shift key is dimmer than everywhere else and I've seen other buyers say the same; it's not totally dead, just dim. Also the preinstalled windows is a bit bloated and I had a weird glitch with the new audio drivers not working properly. It doesn't seem to be an issue now since I rolled back the drivers.","Other Thoughts:After a little over a day of use, the machine seems to be working optimally save for the aforementioned hiccoughs. I would definitely recommend this model to anyone who wants a laptop that can game but won't look out of place in an office or local coffee shop.",0,0

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Business or Pleasure? Why not both!,2018-04-19,"Pros:The Gigabyte Aero 15X v8 has been outfitted with a number of features that I knew was exactly what I was looking for as both a powerhouse for multimedia creation, and as a gaming beast of a machine.  I'm very impressed with the CPU performance and the graphical power (GTX 1070 MaxQ) that exist on this machine. I also rerally dig the sleek profile and un-assuming design which easily blend into any office environment.The new IPS panel is also a real winner.  With a refresh rate of 144 hz monitor, my experience has been silky smooth for all my work-related applications, web browsing, and gaming experience. It also is slightly more thinner than the previous models which reduces its weight slightly. The keyboard also supports N-Key rollover which will be beneficial in gaming.Sound is actually decent enough, nothing spectacular but its fine for my purpose for listening while working. The battery offers a large capacity at 94 Wh which is perfect for those days I would be out and about. I've been getting an average of 10 hrs.Also to note is that laptop has room for another M.2 (PCI-e) SSD Slot if you do decide to upgrade from the included 512 GB as well as another ram slot for future upgrades.",Cons:There's only a few cons that I ran into. The fans can start ramping up during normal use i.e. writing a document or viewing a webpage so be wary of its noise level. The keyboard also can get some time getting used to. It works perfectly fine but I do feel the keyboard layout felt very slightly more compact than say a macbook pro. The sound could be better as there isn't much in the low end.,"Other Thoughts:All in all, if you're looking for a sleek non-assuming laptop with a incredible performance and power; this laptop is a top contender and I feel its worth the money (if you can overlook its shortcomings).  I for one am very pleased with the laptop and plan to use it for years to come.",2,0

MSI would be cheapest however I like the form factor and the built quality of Aero 15x; also the expandable  storage and ram so I went with Aero 15x. I also considered Asus G501 however I value battery life more than performance (still have to perform better than 1060). Also I prefer the thin bezel so Aero 15x beat the other two. Overall, you can't go wrong with any of the three, I am no longer a hardcore gamer, I also use laptop for professional activities (light audio/video production, meeting, conference,..)

Sure the Gigabyte logo lights up on the front and you have RGB keyboards, but that's it for the gaming features. I just love it.- It comes with a stick of 16 GB of ram. That means that if you want to upgrade to 32 GB in the future, just buy another 16 GB stick.- Bezel-less display with the 144hz refresh rate is amazing.

GIGABYTE,AERO 15-X9-RT5P,5,Just WOW!,2018-04-17,"Pros:This laptop is absolutely amazing! This is the perfect blend of Business and Gamer! With the 144hz monitor this is by far one of the best laptops on the market for mobile gaming! Some of the reviews show that they don't like where the webcam is located but I actually like this location much better then the typical on top of the panel. Being on the bezel allows for a more natural way to pay attention while conference calling others. I like to try and look directly into my camera when speaking to others or doing a training for employees and this lets me do that as well as look at my screen in a more natural way. I am absolutely impressed with how well this is built. It is very thin but feels sturdy! I have heard some try and compare this to the MSI GS65, but this blows that machine out of the water. In considering both, it was an easy decision to go with the Aero 15x!","Cons:As a gamer I would like to see the 10key removed and the mouse placed where the 10key is. Even for work, I don't use the 10key all that much so I feel like that is real estate on any laptop that could be adjusted. Though I love where the webcam is, I am concerned that this is to much electronics in a hinge area. If a hinge breaks by chance (doesn't happen often, but I have had it happen) I would hate for my webcam to lose quality or not function",Other Thoughts:If you are looking at other products the MSI GS65 is a pretty slick laptop. To me there was a night and day difference in quality of products. I am a long time Gigabyte fan as their products have always done me well. Going with a name I trust is always important when making big financial decisions!,1,3

The keyboard has a decent feel to it, and the chassis is pretty good for this price point. Processor speed is adequate, as is the 4GB RAM. As for the screen, I like that it's anti-glare, but that's about it.","Cons:eMMC storage is slow.The USB-A slot would only read about half of my storage sticks.The BIOS wouldn't hold the dev_boot_legacy flag after the system was suspended.'Search' key where the 'Caps Lock' should be. No 'Delete' key.  Other keys missing.ChromeOS doesn't do quite what I want it to.This is probably the WORST TN screen I have seen.  There's no such color as black on this display, just washed out grays. Off angle viewing, even by just a few degrees, is terrible.  It reminds me of the first gen laptop displays back in the 90's.","Other Thoughts:If you're just a casual user, this may be fine, just don't expect to see a stunning display, nor do much outside of the browser. Outdoor use is out of the question, unless it's midnight with a new moon.The ChromeOS didn't give me the flexibility I needed to use this as a telecommute and light programming device, so I installed linuxmint 19.1 cinnamon (pretty much my plan before I even ordered the thing).  The install was pretty straightforward, following the instructions found on the net for enabling developer mode and legacy boot. I chose to overwrite the entire chromeos knowing I wouldn't use it again. I was wrong. After suspending the system overnight, I couldn't wake/reboot it the next morning because the dev_legacy_boot flag got set back to zero.  Thanks, ASUS.  To boot I had to edit a script inside a recovery image so that instead of rewriting chromeos on top of my fresh linuxmint installation it would simply set the flag back to one.  The E203 model is perhaps a better choice if you're going to run Linux, as it looks more like a normal PC. However, you're stuck paying the Micro$oft tax with the E203.",1,0

Most people won't need to upgrade, but the option is nice to have.","Other Thoughts:- Battery life is good, but not fantastic; heavy use throughout the day would require you to use the charger. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as I consider myself a power user. I'm often watching movies, streaming content, and prefer to keep the brightness high, so this is the laptop rarely gets a break- The IO is good, but needs some work, with the right hand side of the laptop sporting a single USB 2.0 port. I would have gladly traded that in for a second USB - C port. However, the HDMI is a welcome sight, as it's getting difficult to find this on many laptops nowadaysOverall, fantastic laptop, especially for the price.

For example, gaming (no ray tracing and always trailing behind Nvidia), and AMD CPU's (while cheaper) typically run hotter and slower than Intel. But... and this is a big But... discrete graphics (separate CPU and GPU) in the thin and light segment is stupid, which is why AMD finally has at least one market cornered with this APU. This thing will more than double the graphics performance of anything embedded within an Intel CPU, and will run for hours in a thin and light laptop with a small battery.

I love the keyboard too.I'm one of those people who has thirteen tabs of Google Chrome open at the same time, and this computer has had no trouble keeping up.","Cons:Any cons on this machine are severely outweighed by that ridiculous price. This model doesn't include a fingerprint reader. The fan runs a lot when it's updating or if you've got too much stuff going on. (It pretty quiet, though. Nothing to worry about.) The webcam is decent, but only decent.One thing I can't figure out is how to turn on the keyboard back light. I've tried every shortcut and settings tab, but nothing. I know it's capable because the keyboard lights up every time it wakes up or turns on.

The AMD version does indeed have a functioning touchscreen (despite the newegg listing) which I am sold on having.   There is no fingerprint scanner in the AMD version, despite what multiple youtube reviewers would tell you.","Cons:-Sound quality is fairly tinny, but not unusable.-No IR light for Windows Hello, meaning you'll need to use a PIN/password to unlock every time.-Screen could be brighter, I frequently have it at 100% indoors.",Other Thoughts:Pick it up if you want a solid daily use computer and do not need the top of the line ultrabook cost.

The PC Manager did a nice job of updating all drivers in a single swoop. It did take a good 3-4 hours to install all of the recommended Windows Updates (which occurred in 3 waves), but once everything was up and running the laptop performed extremely well. The only issue I had was with the very first Windows update which took forever. The screen would go black and I thought I accidentally turned off the laptop which you are not supposed to do.I cannot comment on things like battery life since the laptop is now with my daughter, but this felt more like a $750+ laptop than a $530 laptop. Solid metal alloy frame. Nice touchscreen. Nice chiclet backlit, spill-resistant keyboard. Upward facing speakers with ample volume. 14"" screen while well under 4 lbs. I would definitely purchase again.Considering what happened to the last laptop, we also purchased the ipearl mcover for the Honor Magicbook 14, which fit perfectly.

Huawei,53010BLA,5,Simply the best all round laptop at this price point.  Amazing!,2019-01-12,"Pros:I'm writing this review on my new MateBook D 14.  I have been looking for a new ultrabook for months and months now and didn't want to break the bank.  Well with this laptop it's a win/win.  On sale at $529 and even at the $550 price this is a no brainer if you are looking for something for productivity and a little gaming.  The Vega Graphics pummel the intel integrated offering and the Ryzen 5, 4 cores and 8 threads even outperform the intel i5 8th gen on some work loads.  The M.2 SSD is easily upgraded if needed.  The battery life so far has been far more than I expected.  The finish and feel of this laptop is solid.  And I was shocked to see there is no irritating bloatware installed.  The only manufacture application is called the PC Manager and it is actually nice to check for driver updates.  Even the SSD partitions are sized to maximize the space on the SSD.  No over the top recovery partition that is sized too big which will waste usable space.The first time startup was clean... I did end up downloading the Windows media creation tool so I would get the latest 1809 built of Windows 10.  No issues with the update as expected.Unless you need the GPU power of  an Nvidia MX150, I just can't see paying the extra $$$ for the Intel platform and the Nvidia graphics?  Another $200-$300 I think?  Not sure if that is an option in this series of laptop.I'm shocked at how cool this runs too.  And for that matter, the screen at 1080p is really nice.  At this size of screen, I don't think you get a huge benefit to jump to 2k or 4k for that matter.  It's designed for productivity with the opportunity to so some gaming on the side.  I'm happy with the 1920x1080 resolution.  Oh, and it's touch screen.  I forgot about the touch screen until after I had everything setup.  I likely won't use the touch screen much, but then again, it's there if you need it.All in all, I'm still shocked at how nice this laptop presents itself.  Down right solid and the finish is beautiful.  As I mentioned earlier, you can't go wrong here at the price point.","Cons:Not sure if this is much of a con, but my last laptop had external volume buttons on the edge... I do kind of miss that, but not worries on getting used to the Windows Key + FKey volume up and down combination.",Other Thoughts:There is a reason that the early reviews of this laptop are a solid stars... they are well deserved!,2,0

Those gaming laptops always had terribly weak speakers, trackpads, screen flex, and not-so-great screens. This laptop is well worth the money plus some. If I were to price this laptop, I would put it around $1000 (almost twice what I paid for this!)",0,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,US Contraband,2018-12-28,"Pros:Let's face it, there is everything to like about this laptop and no cons. Feels like a premium machine for half the price. I came from a HP Spectre i7500u that didn't have as good a display (bright and crisp), or as good as GPU. I mostly casually game and write, and this computer does both flawlessly. The keyboard is one of the best I've ever used, and the track pad is extremely responsive. Build is extremely sturdy and even though it looks like a MacBook, it's charming in it's own regard. It's also a touch screen, although I could go without it. System is snappy and fast, feels like I have double the RAM even though it's only 8 GB. Extremely satisfied with this laptop, as the hunt has been going for almost a year now and I'm finally very satisfied. I was gaming League and accidentally wasn't plugged in, noticed it about 2 - 3 hours in and still had an hour left on charge. I was skeptical about this laptop but it has exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more pleased. Even the windows 10 is minimal bloatware. Zero driver issues which I was worried about with AMD.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Apparently the US is warning consumers of this brand and Trump is trying to ban them out of the US. I support any brand that delivers quality goods.,9,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,"Great computer, with some false advertising.",2018-12-28,"Pros:This laptop is basically a Windows Macbook. It has a great aluminum body, great keyboard, beautiful screen (my one definite requirement in a laptop, since I work in graphic design), fast SSD, and a surprisingly good processor. My main use for this laptop will be connecting via remote desktop to my beast of a desktop, and for that purpose, this well exceeds my expectations for the price range. It's nearly a blatant copy of a Macbook, honestly (without the Huawei branding, you'd think it was an Apple), except it runs Windows and has a touchscreen, but if you don't mind the copycat aspect of it, it's wonderful.","Cons:I mentioned false advertising, because the product page says this ships with a fingerprint sensor, but Windows tells me this device does not have one. So, I'm not sure whether it just has one that strangely isn't compatible with the operating system it ships with, or just that it doesn't have one, but I was really looking forward to the fingerprint sensor. I have a Huawei phone, and the fingerprint sensor on that is really phenomenal, so again, I was really looking forward to having that here. But hey, it also said it wasn't a touch screen, and it came with one, so I won't complain too loudly.","Other Thoughts:All in all, this is an really good bargain for what you're getting, and while I'm severely disappointed that I was promised a fingerprint sensor and didn't get one, I cannot in good faith give this laptop less than 5 stars.",1,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,"So far, amazing, but got touchscreen instead of non-touchscreen with Ryzen 2500U",2018-10-30,"Pros:- Beautiful- Fast SSD- Matched or surpassed all of my specs and price point criteria: ~$600, 8GB RAM, 8th gen intel or comparable Ryzen (which I got), 256 GB SSD, colorful bright screen, decent keyboard, precision touchpad, 13-15"" screen- Has front facing speakers- The F row of keys, like a macbook, by default do functions like volume or screen brightness instead of the F keys, which is super nice. the Fn key turns them ""back"" into F1-F12, similar to a macbook- Screen rotates until it is flat with keyboard, which is really nice- strong, solid hinge, screen doesnt wobble at all when typing.- Full size HDMI port is awesome, as is the connectivity vs a macbook- Minimal bloatware, just one Huawei app that is very easy to uninstall","Cons:Biggest con: was supposed to be without a touchscreen and Ryzen 2500U as per the possible selections, but it came with a touchscreen anyway. I didnt want the touchscreen since it drains battery life constantly whether it is in use or not. Oh well, guess I'll just have to live with it now.- USB C charging cable is kind of short, about 6 feet. I'd 100% recommend buying a longer one if you're going to be bringing this into coffee shops, at least 12 feet.Haven't found any other cons yet. It's a fantastic computer.","Other Thoughts:- It looks exactly like a macbook and I constantly keep checking whether I should be pressing the Cmd key instead of Ctrl for keyboard shortcuts, oops- Fan turns on kind of frequently and is louder than most ""new high end"" laptops. Doesn't bother me though.- Battery life, due to the touchscreen which I never wanted in the first place, is a little worse than I'd like. 6-7 hours instead of something like 7-9 hours. I'll live with it, but wouldve just liked there not to be a touchscreen in the first place.- Just a personal opinion, but the Huawei logo is kinda ugly and looks like NBC or something. I'd like there to be no logo on the back of the laptop. It's ""printed"" on, I think I'll try that sugarcube thing and just scratch it off while not damaging the metal :)",8,1

Huawei,53010BLA,5,One of the Best Laptops at it's Price,2018-09-09,"Pros:This computer (specifically the model you're looking at) blows me away in CPU and GPU performance at it's price. I am a student and yknow most kids love to play games and 3D a lot, and this computer does a great job. As a YouTuber, I can get up to 1080p60fps doing lightweight gaming like Minecraft and Roblox (low graphics settings, but I'm sure it can handle higher)! The i7 really kicks butt and the SSD boots up the computer super fast (<5 seconds). As for Adobe, it also works excellent handling Photoshop and Illustrator at a breeze.","Cons:The only real con I see is the battery life, it drains super fast (2 hours) if I do recording (1080p60s) and 3D gaming. If it's website and document usage, like for typing an essay, I can get up to 5-6 hours of usage time. At a full charge unplugged, it discharges (during sleep and off) around a percent per 5 hours but I don't usually leave it unplugged overnight.","Other Thoughts:This computer is probably in my opinion, one of the best cheap laptops out there. I wasn't even aware Huawei had Windows Laptops, as I've had Honor 8 and Mate 10 for a year (also great phones). If I could message Huawei, I'd say ""Excellent work!

Lenovo tech says ""no solution"" and Lenovo customer service says just change settings (um, yea, we got that, but the software isn't allowing it anymore)  geesh  Multiple complaints on the Lenovo website and Lenovo doesn't care","Other Thoughts:So....  I wrote a  review (below) to Lenovo after I was forced to return this due to Zoom driver issues (as did many other reviewers)  Their insulting response is below my review giving us a basic, elementary instruction (which obviously we tried multiple times before contacting Window and Lenovo Tech support)  Hey Lenovo, It's bad enough you wasted our time along with many others, but don't insult us further by giving us a lame reply.  Shame, shame.· 4 days agoIt's the little things that matter......like customer service and solutions to minor problems. We are returning this laptop today after only a week. There is a small problem, yet intolerable one, with the touch pad features. After two days, we were informed that it is not something that can be fixed. You cannot turn off the touchpad features that cause a zoom if the the touchpad is accessed in a certain way. I tried to find a solution to this on my own for hours. Windows did a remote session and was pretty confused as to why all of the touchpad options were missing. Windows support advised me to go to Lenovo support. Lenovo support not only did not support, they advised me to do something that would have caused more issues and then ended the chat before I could ask more questions. Next, my husband stepped in. He went through Lenovo support and finally, the truth was revealed. Due to a split between the software companies Elan and Synaptics, the annoying touchpad problem could not be corrected. I will note that my husband is the CIO of a college with over 10,000 students and also, on the Board of his state's Education CIOs. They network and they talk and the recommend. In short, Lenovo wasted many, many hours of our time and that just isn't right. A new driver should have been created for this product or Lenovo shouldn't continue to sell it... end of product line or not. As far as the rest of the details, it is lightweight with a big, bright screen, but I just can't trust the product and suspect other defects will be present.

Lenovo,81DE00L0US,3,Just okay.,2019-02-19,"Pros:The price, although, you get what you pay for, and the number keypad.","Cons:The battery is awful, which I had previously read and yet wasn’t convinced, the battery cord is shorter than most, the computer is packed with products I neither want nor need and had to remove a number of programs and adjust a number of defaulted security settings. I also intermittently encounter connectivity issues with websites, which doesn’t occur with any of my other half a dozen devices. Probably most frustrating is the mousepad. If you don’t have a wireless mouse, but one. Otherwise, you’ll end up frustrated.",,3,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,"Good laptop for the price, terrible battery life",2019-01-18,"Pros:lightweight, clean look, decent specs, comfortable keyboard with 10-key addition which is nice for data entrydecent speakers for light music listening or watching YouTube videos","Cons:Terrible battery life, even on battery saver mode, don't expect to get more than a few hours of use out of this, and that's without streaming any videos, etc.","Other Thoughts:I use this laptop mainly for research and writing, while I did wish it had a backlit keyboard, it was something I sacrificed for the price. The one major flaw is the battery life of the unit.",1,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Adequate with a few quirks,2018-12-26,"Pros:Fairly thin, satisfactorily weight, screen is clear and bright.  Keyboard is easy to type on / no issues.  Touch pad is large which was one key purchasing factor for me.","Cons:Little disappointed with the touch pad - it has integrated / seamless buttons at the bottom of it.  If you're finger just rests on where the button lies you can't move the cursor (maybe an update can fix this?).  It's a tough habit to break having having real physical buttons.  I mean do you use your desktop mouse with your pointer (clicking) finger raised off the button the whole time?Unit is completely sealed - the battery is not serviceable / replaceable without taking the whole thing apart.  Essentially don't expect to upgrade anything with relative ease.Loaded with bloatware of course, junk software that you're only allowed to use as a trial then required to pay.Literally booted the machine up, ran thru Win10 setup, went to uninstall McAfee (see note above) and the system black screened on reboot and would NOT load Windows thereafter.  Had to restore from image after first reboot!  What the heck!?",Other Thoughts:I expected more performance considering a Gen 8 i5 and solid state drive.  I guess if I took this thing apart I'd find a no name china knock off SSD.  Yes its faster than a conventional drive but as far as solid state goes - its one of the slowest I've ever used.,4,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,Returned two glitchy laptops in two weeks,2018-12-20,"Pros:Fast start up, lovely design, very light weight, nice screen size.  Love the DVD/CD drive, most laptops don't even have those anymore.  Price was alright.","Cons:First laptop worked at first, but the shift key was stuck a lot. Not great because I type 100+ wpm and who needs a sticky keys window interrupting every few seconds.  Also the computer started to say ""plugged in, not charging"" a week after I purchased it.  I was told this is a rare bug, Lenovo said this is an economy mode setting, which I hadn't touched.  I returned the computer for a new one without a problem.The second computer had problems immediately when it was set up.  CPU ran anywhere from 35-70% with no programs running, it was all ""background tasks"" I couldn't kill.  The fan was so loud it started to gave me a headache and never stopped.  The fast access apps on the start menu, when deleted, came back as soon as the computer was restarted.  Any game apps that came pre-installed like Candy Crush or Minecraft had no way to delete them OR open them.  This one went back for a refund instead.","Other Thoughts:The price is okay, found better for cheaper elsewhere, and Newegg was good about the returns, but when they refunded me for the laptop, they had a 48$ ""price adjustment"" that they took off what they refunded me, and when I contacted them they said they had already sent me that part of the refund.  ...no, no they didn't, so I had to get on with customer support about that, and that was just irritating on top of the rest of the issues.The laptops had potential, but I dislike broken keys and being on with support 10 minutes after opening a box, and re-boxing to return an hour later.  Newegg was great until the 48$ wasn't returned.  Just waiting for that now.",10,0

Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Great Laptop for the $,2018-12-12,"Pros:- Very little bull bloatware, really only McAfee and the Lenovo ""tools""- Simple design, big keyboard (for us)- Ryzen5 65w processor- Decent Video power- SSD",Cons:- So far none- Newegg:  your offensive language filter is STUPID,"Other Thoughts:Guys, I've only had it a few days.  It is simple, to the point, great.  Runs fast enough.  Blew McAfee away and tweaked services, it's snappy.  Video is pretty decent, You could probably run most games (I haven't tried them all yet) on low, which is OK by me for a laptop in this range.  I know for a fact it will run Shadows of Mordor in between low - medium at a decent fps clip.  Runs Warframe great.   But I didn't buy it for gaming exclusively.tl'dr - great laptop so far!update:  It's still going great.",6,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,"Buggy, returned Two in two weeks.",2018-12-09,"Pros:I didn't have the laptops long enough to get a really good feel for them, unfortunately.  The first laptop I received was okay, but had some bugs in it.  Everything ran decently for about a week.  Fast start up, good graphics, fast downloads, everything a casual computer person needs to do the little things like play WoW and smaller games that don't require a lot.What I really, really liked about this laptop?  CD/DVD drive.  That was *AWESOME* because I have a lot of DVD's and I know laptops in the last few years have done away with them.Newegg was great about returning the laptops.  I first exchanged it for a new one thinking ""well one time isn't unheard of.""","Cons:Pointer's fastest speed was half of what others are.  First laptop had a shift key that wouldn't work right and after a week the battery said ""plugged in, not charging"" which I was told was a rare bug.  Lenovo told me it was an ecomony mode.. but I didn't have any of that set up.  I sent it back without hassle from Newegg, so that was very nice.  (Will need to figure out how to get warranty refunded since I only had the computers for a total of a week all together...)The second laptop, however, had a LOT of problems.  Touchpad issue again, which was annoying, but first time out of the box, the fan is running like I had the computer three years in a dusty room and never shut it off.  I checked my CPU and it was bouncing from 35-70% with one small program running!  So I look deeper and there are over 100 background ""tasks"" running that every time I end them, they pop right back up and resume eating my CPU, I can't find them to delete whatever is making them, and it's not like I installed anything except the basic programs on the laptop (Discord, Firefox at the time).After both of these problems, there are *many* apps in the start menu I could not delete, could not open, and could not do anything with.  Support was no help on this and just said ""We need to look further into this issue, we'll contact you.""  Things like Candy Crush and Minecraft that... honestly, if you're going to advertise for these, at least let people uninstall the shortcut or even open them to figure out what the heck they do, because clicking on them got me no where and right clicking on them only had the ""pin to start"" option.Which brings me to my final problem.  There's the cascading walls of ""fast access"" apps on the start menu, right?  I hate them.  I unpin them as fast as I can because it's ugly and obnoxious looking.  So tech support is helping me with another issue I'm having (really great to be on with tech support 10 minutes after unboxing a brand new laptop, by the way, because of a bunch of problems...) and they reboot my computer.  ALL the ""fast access"" apps are back in my start menu.  So I unpin them again, shut the computer down, and start it back up.  ALL BACK.  AGAIN.I'm not super tech savvy in the way that some people can build computers, but the CPU thing alone with the 100+ background tasks running was enough to send up major red flags.  I contacted several of my computer geek/tech friends and they all said the same thing: There is something majorly wrong with that laptop.So, the replacement laptop is going back too, for a refund this time.  Unfortunately, for someone like me, who wants a simple sturdy brick that'll last more than a year to play video games, watch movies, and have a few other programs running at the same time, this is not even an option to consider.",,4,8
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Great laptop for the price!,2018-11-24,Pros:-Performance is good for this thin of a laptop-SSD makes a big difference-Keyboard is really good for the price-Trackpad is acceptable-Build quality is great so far (had it for almost 3 months)-IO is good,"Cons:-Screen is a garbage TN panel, but no dead pixels or other issues-Battery lasts 4 hours, when in power saving mode just browsing the internet.",Other Thoughts:-Overall great product-If I was Lenovo I would have switched out the optical drive for a bigger battery-Would recommend for the price I paid ($500),2,2
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Very good Laptop. Great bang for the buck!,2018-11-08,"Pros:Good graphics(for the price), decently fast cpu, and good display!",Cons:No Cons! It was amazing.,Other Thoughts:When I first saw this laptop I was skeptical because of the reviews. But when I actually got to use it I found out that all those bad reviews were lies. This laptop is an amazing bang for the buck computer. I would definitely recommend!,5,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,Warning: Touchpad Issues,2018-10-30,Pros:Didn't get that far,"Cons:The only touchpad setting you can adjust is sensitivity. You cannot turn off ""tap to click"". This is per Lenovo tech support. If you dislike ""tap to click"", as I do, stay away from this laptop. Spent an hour updating drivers and bios before contacting tech support and learning it was futile. Simply cannot be done. No way, No how. This info should be in the product description.BTW, I'm an electrical engineer with 35 years experience in the computer industry and know what I'm doing.","Other Thoughts:Be aware that if you decide to return this laptop, despite it, in my opinion, being defective, you will have to pay a $75 restocking fee. And return shipping as well. Wanna talk to Newegg about it? Current phone hold time estimate is 75 minutes. Online chat is at max capability and not accepting chat requests. My respect for both Lenovo and Newegg has decreased considerably. Will be buying a laptop somewhere else.",14,23

Those running Windows 10 might have a more stellar experience, however I was a bit disappointed that the Touchpad is not working using Linux Operating System.Would have preferred two separate in/out slots one for Mic & one for Headphone. The Combo Mic & Headphone doesn't work properly. Bought a Bluetooth enabled mouse and was able to move the Curser around with Linux Mint.Overall pleased. It could be better.",6,4

Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,"Fast, Reasonably Priced, Reliable Brand (for me)",2018-09-27,"Pros:This is my third Lenovo laptop.  I bought this one because of the specs and price, but especially because of the reliability of the first two.The processor is very fast, coupled with the SSD and 8Gb of memory this machine runs very well.  The display is very good as well.The machine also has a wired LAN connector and a CD/DVD Drive which are getting less common on many laptops.","Cons:I've read reviews of this model where people complained about relatively low battery life, fan noise and the somewhat small SSD.  For my purposes, the battery life is not an issue as I seldom move it around for extended period of time.  I've had no fan issues either.  However, the SSD issue may be another matter.Knowing the size of the drive before I purchased the laptop, I thought that I would just store some lesser used programs and files on an SDHC card.  Upon inserting the card into the SDHC slot, I found it only goes half way in, leaving half the card exposed.  This would put the card in a precarious position which could affect performance and reliability of using it for working storage.  I had never seen a PC card slot that did not fully encompass the card.  There could not have been much savings involved in constructing the slot in this manner so I wonder why they did it.","Other Thoughts:I feel this is a well built machine, especially for the money.  While it has a few shortcomings, they aren't that significant for me and I would definitely recommend this machine.Also, for what I believe is the first time ever for a New Egg order, the package arrived 2 day earlier than scheduled.",7,2
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,"Good computer, some things could be improved",2018-09-19,"Pros:- Seems to working well so far. Everything is smooth, and I previously installed the Witcher 3 on this computer. It ran at almost 30 fps on low and 720p, and was smooth.- Keyboard is nice and quiet, and easy to type with. I like it.- display is 1080p which looks pretty nice in my opinion.- Cover and exterior looks pretty neat.- computer is pretty light- SSD runs very fast.","Cons:- Battery life. It can last the entire school day without dying, if I lock it or put it to sleep most of the time.- Battery life again. DO NOT USE BATTERY SAVER. IT MADE MY BATTERY GO DOWN 2 PERCENT IN A MINUTE.- It whirs audibly and I don't really have a problem with the sound, but some people may not like it.- When running simple applications like microsoft word and using bluetooth, battery goes down fairly quickly.- Space is too small. If it also came with a 500gb hard drive along with the 256gb SSD, it would be better in my opinion.","Other Thoughts:- I would recommend it, if you aren't looking for long battery life. It is pretty good for its price- I most likely would not buy it again, unless the battery was better.- If there was something about the product I would change, it would be the battery, and maybe the small amount of space. Most people don't need too much space but if you are into gaming or downloading movies, 256 GB isn't big enough.",6,2
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,3,Ok laptop.,2018-09-01,Pros:Boot up times are fast,Cons:Fan is extremely loud when performing simple tasks like searching the web or watching youtube.Display could be better.,,4,6
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Great bang for buck!,2018-08-31,"Pros:- Ryzen 2500U is a great CPU, 4c/8t and an awesome integrated GPU with Vega 8- Dual Channel DDR4 2400 RAM- Little bloatware (McAfee)- Solid build quality for price segment, the plastic looks metallic- Can game very well, beats the balls off Intel HD graphics- 256GB SSD in this price range is insane perf/$ for storage","Cons:- TN panel is meh quality, but that's really to be expected for price range- Don't even touch the Intel i5 options, you get similar CPU performance and terrible graphics performance","Other Thoughts:- When gaming, make sure you configure the Windows Power profile, reduce CPU to 50-75% max to give more power to Vega 8 so it can boost its clocks way high for 10-20% extra performance.",17,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Good Exp,2018-08-30,Pros:Fast and as expected,Cons:nothing so far,,1,5
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Nice Machine for the Money,2018-07-28,"Pros:So just writing about the hardware, everything seems to work, which is of course expected, but it doesn't always happen. Its thin, about 4 1/2 lbs and gives a bright enough display, though for me at least, the display has to be set at 100% in a normally lit room. Speakers are on the tinny side, with little bass but certainly loud and clear enough. Start up is very quick (less than 10 sec) with the i5 cpu and the 256 Gb  Samsung SSD. And the machine is quiet. Having two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 3.1 c port is very good. One can purchase a USB 3.0 adapter at a small price if the USB 3.1 c port is not needed and one wants to have a third USB 3.0 port available.It took me a little time to get the hang of the touchpad to use the mouse consistently, but once I got some practice I found using the trackpad mouse has been fine. Using the keyboard on this machine is a highlight to me. Finger contact with the keys is easy but strong enough to give a nice feeling in use. Of the three laptops I've used in the last fifteen years this is my favorite, especially for using the keyboard.Taking a look at a couple YouTube videos of similar Lenovo models had me feeling confident that upgrading to a larger SSD in the future and cleaning the fan of dust build up would be relatively easy along with eventual battery replacement because of the straight forward disassembly of the bottom and easy access to those parts.","Cons:The wifi device on this Lenovo is 8.02.11 ac only.  Lenovo could have made this laptop more versatile had they used a dual band wifi device. In my own situation our router is broadcasting at 8.02.11 b g/n, so I use a small USB wifi adapter in the laptop that picks up that protocol to get around the issue.There is no hdd activity light on the computer.  To me, at least, I use that light as a key marker for the progress of activities and wish there were one as on previous laptops I've owned. That missing light is something I've always resented macs for not having.Although I have not run the battery all the way down at this point at one sitting it appears I can get a couple hours of use out of it at most before needing to recharge.","Other Thoughts:I bought a Lenovo laptop for my daughter about 7 years ago that still runs fine, though a bit slow for today's applications. Hopefully build quality is still as good if not better.",8,5
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Better than average laptop,2018-07-13,Pros:Lenovo brand name. Samsung SSD. Optical drive. 10-key. Runs quiet. Smooth. Virtually no bloatware!,"Cons:It does not look like you can replace the SSD without taking the entire bottom casing apart. One day I might try but for now, I'll have to manage with 256GB.","Other Thoughts:I removed the factory partition that was taking up 25GB of space. The display is OK...for the price it's acceptable. For about $100-150 more, I could've got a better screen.  Battery life is OK.",4,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Exactly what I expected,2018-07-04,Pros:- Good internals- Fast- Good keyboard- Decent screen (what is expected from a TN panel)- Rigid build (even if built with plastic),Cons:- Limited battery life,,4,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Great laptop for what it was created to do.,2018-06-10,"Pros:This laptop performs excellently. the quad core processor combined with the SSD allow for quick load times on most applications. The casing itself is pretty solid. Even if it is not aluminum it seems sturdy enough with an appropriate amount of flexibility on the screen so that it isn't too susceptible to breaking. The tile style keys are well made, they have a very satisfying tactile response that is great for typing. The screen's brightness is really good, but it's not extremely reflective like a macbook, so there is far less of an issue with glaring. Having a disc drive and SD card slot are great for anyone who wants to watch media on the laptop separate from the internet Up to this point the power cable feels extremely secure in its port and takes effort to remove, which is a bonus if you're using it somewhere where it may be jostled around. On that same note, having an SSD instead of an HDD is great for preserving your data against damage from vibration. Having a laptop with a number pad is also very convenient for someone who needs to do calculations and input data. The speakers are about your average laptop quality, except for that they are able to surpass many that I have had experience with in terms of sheer volume.","Cons:The only downside that I feel isn't a result of getting the laptop cheaper than the more expensive options is the location of the track pad. While I do understand the idea of putting the track pad directly below the space bar instead of dead center, I often have issue left clicking when I'm not looking at the track pad because it takes a very conscious effort to reach that side of the trackpad.",,18,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,1,Customer service is horrible,2019-03-06,Pros:nice looking device,Cons:warranty options are non existent for repair,Other Thoughts:if you purchase a laptop from Huawei your only option for warranty service is to send it to their North American location in Texas.  You will be without your device for 7-10 days minimum.  They have no other service locations and there are no other options.  They will not send you a loaner device nor are there any partner service companies that can service your device.   Buyer beware!!!!!,1,1

I randomly remove it for flights and travel.Yesterday I open it to see a completely blank/black screen. The touch screen still works (when connected to HDMI via USB-C) but otherwise, its done. Booting to BIOS is black, POST screen is non existent, but the external display works.I've contacted Huawei in the long shot hopes of getting a fix, as this really was a fantastic machine.",3,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Fantastic Laptop for Graduate Student in Science,2018-11-24,"Pros:My review is a bit biased since this is the nicest laptop I've ever owned, but this thing is just incredible for its size and price.1) Processing speed is top-notch2) Display is crisp and very bright, which is perfect for typing or reading articles outside3) No tape over the web cam - I do not use the web camera often so this is not a problem for me as it is some people4) Ive had this laptop for 4 months and have had zero issues installing or running any software (including data analysis programs, which run very fast on this laptop)5) Decent internal storage but great speed for regularly backing-up data6) Super lightweight and durable; sleek profile7) Speakers are the best of any laptop I have used or heard8) Backlii keyboard and keyboard style make long days of typing easy9) Touch screen is great; I actually did not know this was a touch screen until after I bought it.... silly but was a pleasant surprise!10) Touchpad sensitivity is often said to be a Con, but I love how quickly I can move around the screen. I usually hook-up to multiple monitors, so it can become difficult transitioning and not using a mouse. This touchpad solves that issue","Cons:There are not many Cons for me1) Webcam angle is weird. although I dont use it often, it is a bit strange when needed2) Fan sometimes gets really loud when the computer is plugged in; not difficult to ignore though3) Wish there was an HDMI port in addition to the current USB-C and USB ports. I usually hook up to two additional screens but even with the USB-C converter sent with the laptop, this is not possible with mouse and keyboard unless the user has logitech unifying devices.Aside from these things, which really don't impact me very much, this laptop is downright amazing. Will buy Huawei again if they keep up this level of quality for price. Beats MacBooks by a mile considering the bang for you buck.",,0,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,3,"Almost, but not quite (yet)",2018-11-17,Pros:- Great screen- Great size- Great power,"Cons:- Still no option to leave backlit keyboard ON or to have it turn on when trackpad is used (it is also not the brightest)- Trackpad loose out of the box, resulting in rattling and requiring a hardware hack to try and address- Fan noise is very annoying (my XPS 13 was much quieter)","Other Thoughts:- Hoping Huawei spends the few hours to program, test and push a BIOS or software option to change the backlit keyboard settings",0,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,2,Very Good For About 3 months,2018-11-10,"Pros:Very nice battery live, Stylish and easy to handle on your hands. Screen is out of this world and Sound is just the best i ever listen to on a laptop.",Cons:Gave me the blue screen of death several times withing the first use.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop is just amazing on almost every aspects. I just have bad experience with the service. If Huawei wants to compete with Apple or Dell, they have to step up their customer services. I most to have a defective device front the beginning because i had several blue screens withing the first uses. I rebooted the PC and then it works every single time. After 3 months it did not came back on at all. The last blue crashed the PC did not recovered from it. I understand that  stuff happens some time with technology and electronic devices but when you paid $1,600 for a PC you deserved a better service. I called the Huawei and after spending 20 minutes with then over the phone they asked me to send the PC to them  so they can fix it and send it back to me. This is a work PC and I'm dead with out it. So now I have to wait Who knows for how long to get the PC back. This is just not right. If a device dyes withing the first 3 months they should just find a way to take care of the customers. Again I know that stuff happens but coming from Apple service to this is just depressing. Not a pleasant experience.",3,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,1,Dead after 3 months,2018-10-31,Pros:Was great while it lasted,"Cons:Won't boot at all after only three months. Very disappointing, worked fine one day, closed the lid...came back next day and power button does nothing.","Other Thoughts:I'll update my rating if it gets fixed, but my research so far has shown Huawei isn't great to work with. This machine may look great but have underlying issues that are starting to show, so buyer beware. No one wants to waste $1500.",4,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,4,"Laptop is good, problems getting Office 365 working",2018-10-17,Pros:Laptop and graphics look great and run very smoothly. Great value so far in terms of design and usability. Let's hope it stays that way for at least several years!,"Cons:-The ""1-Year free"" Office 365 Personal initially came deactivated. The version pre-installed on the laptop was only a 14-day trial, and it asked for payment for the full version. After some back and forth with Huawei, Newegg, and Microsoft, Microsoft agreed to provide a 1-year activation for the Office software, attached to a Microsoft user account.-Graphical interface for older apps is very messed up, sometimes unusable. Windows, icons, buttons, and installer menus on some old (pre-2011) and not-so-old apps are either teeny-tiny, or blurry and stretched, on the full 3000x2000 resolution display. This was true for Faststone image capture, Winamp, and a few other apps.-Text occasionally gets cut off on the right side of the page. Again, I believe it's an issue with the 3000x2000 display, which is a non-standard aspect ratio. While the display is very crisp and clear, Huawei really needs to update their graphics drivers to fix these problems.","Other Thoughts:-Just hope the manufacturer and seller are being honest in the product description, about whether the software is really free or just a trial version.",2,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,3,Good and bad in one device,2018-09-02,Pros:The battery life is great. Much better than my Lenovo Yoga X1 third gen. The wcreeen in very bright and sharp.,Cons:The keyboard is very shallow. Won’t let me type fast.  The plastic scratches easily. Very cheap plastic.,,2,2

I really like the..-back lit keyboard-speakers (they really do have great sound to them)-beautiful screen-ease of typing,"Cons:Gets pretty hot on the bottom when charging and using, the mouse pad can be a little over sensitive to certain touch (like it will select something I didn't intend it to at times)",Other Thoughts:This review is based on the fact that I recently bought this laptop and so I will continue to see how it goes with continual use,4,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,The MateBook X Pro is a VERY impressive laptop,2018-08-16,"Pros:The MateBook X Pro is a speedy, lightweight laptop with a gorgeous (touch) screen. I've been impressed from the very moment I removed it from the box. Fan noise hasn't been an issue at all. The fingerprint reader in the power button is stupid fast and very accurate - like this better than the Windows Hello camera on the Surface Pro. My unit came with the latest BIOS 1.12 and only had a handful of driver updates from Huawei to install. Highly recommend!","Cons:- Came with Windows 10 Home, but it's an easy upgrade to Pro for $99 - I did this primarily to enable Bitlocker drive encryption- The underside gets a bit warm at times but never hot or uncomfortable- Not to nitpick, but the power adapter plug is a strange arrangement and will block adjacent outlets on a power strip- It would be nice if there were an option to keep the backlight for the keyboard on","Other Thoughts:I've been using a Surface Pro for the last few years (Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4 and the 2017 Surface Pro - all with the keyboard cover as well as the Surface docking station setup). I recently tired the Surface Book 2 and found it to be a very nice machine but it was a bit heavy for daily travel and a little ""clunky"" for lack of a better word. I'd been eyeing the MateBook X Pro, but just wasn't sure without any experience with Huawei. Prior to purchasing the MateBook X Pro, I pored over reviews for at least two months - it was a toss up between this and the XPS 13 9370 (2018) model. Ultimately, I think Huawei has done a stellar job here and I'm certainly not missing out on anything by not going with the XPS.",7,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Matebook X Pro is the best,2018-08-14,"Pros:I have been using the Matebook X Pro for about a week now. There is nothing I don't like about the Matebook. Touchpad, screen, style, keyboard, touch screen, MX150, ports its all a A++","Cons:Many complain about the fan, but after 2 days and all windows updates, it is very quiet. Under power options, if you change the maximum CPU Processing power to 99%, you will not here the fan at all, than create an All performance power option if you want to be all out at 100%. I haven't found any cons yet.",Other Thoughts:What a price for such specs. I love it in every aspect and have been enjoying it since I received it out of the box. Huawei will take over the industry very shortly and Apple should be afraid.,2,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Amazing,2018-07-31,Pros:I love the matebook x pro. So far it’s preformed great and every feature is outstanding.-The four speakers are really clear and loud for watching videos and listening to music-The screen is crystal clear and really close to the edges.-It contains that Nvidia graphics card and still remains really light for carrying it anywhere.,Cons:I haven’t really noticed anything to complain about. The camera is an odd viewing angle but I never use the camera and would rather have the screen ratio.,,0,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Bought for Work,2018-07-28,"Pros:Really, most everything about this computer is a pro. Fast boot up times, great screen, perfect for work. I specifically wanted something that was NOT a 2 in 1, and this fit the bill. Great specs for the price. Not really any bloatware outside of the garbage that comes with Windows (not huawei’s fault there). Really I have no complaints. Feels quality, love the solid materials and the grey feeling finish.","Cons:I really don’t consider these cons personally, because they don’t matter to me but so people know:1. The camera placement is great for privacy if you don’t use your camera (I never do so I really like this), but the angle and camera quality aren’t great if you’re a heavy webcam user or do virtual meeting stuff. Fine in a pinch, but not for frequent use.2. The ports were a bit snug at first, though a week in to my use and they’re fine now....really I can’t think of anything else....the charging brick is a bit of an odd shape and is sort of awkward?

Huawei,53010CAJ,5,amazing,2018-07-19,Pros:Amazing screenAmazing keyboardAmazing specsAmazing price,"Cons:Newegg decided to just put the computer box in another box and ship it out with nothing else in the box.

Still irritating, but worth it.No dedicated media buttons.","Other Thoughts:Very nice boxSound is amazing, best description is it's like audio in 3D, you can almost feel how the audio is being played.

Huawei,53010CAJ,4,Great product! not perfect yet,2018-05-30,"Pros:I bought this laptop after two months of reasearch and here are my thoughts.First of all you need to know what you're looking for in a laptop. Do you want it for hard core gaming, a mobile workstation, or an all around laptop with great mobility? For each one of these categories the specs of the desired laptop will vary.Based on this, what I was looking for was an all around laptop which is modern, good looking, great build quality, great LCD quality for photo editing, good enough battery life for a day at work, good performance occasional coding and simulation (because I mostly use my PC for this), and  maybe occasional gaming,  and all these under 1800 CAD.Here are my pros and cons for this laptop based on what was importannt for me in a laptop:Pros:-Awesome design and build quality-Great LCD and color accuracy-Good enough battery life of about 9 hours on better battery mode-relatively light and thin-Above average performance (not the best among 8550u equiped laptops)-Great value for what you get! the best price among competitors","Cons:The fan is loud when plugged in and it can get annoying to some ppl. This can be fixed by using a lower performance power plan though. I hope a bios update fixes this issue. However, the same issue is also observed in the Dell XPS, lenovo X1 carbon and all other ultra books with high performance specs.","Other Thoughts:Altough not perfect, but I would defenitely recommend this product since it is one of the best laptops you can get for this price!",1,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,"""The Best Laptop Right Now"" - By The Verge",2018-05-30,Pros:Everything,Cons:Battery (still better than most and also macbook pro(with touch bar)Webcam Position.,Other Thoughts:Just Go for it,0,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,4,There is still a lot of work for improvement (3rd generation MateBook X),2018-05-28,Pros:+ 3:2 aspect ratio +  Gorilla Glass touchscreen + sRGB coverage 95% + no PWM (pulse-width modulation) + narrow bezels + Thunderbolt 3 + USB 3.0 Type-A (customers request) + high quality chassis,Cons:- lack of SD card - coil whine while AC adapter plugged in - slower '1D12' variant of the GeForce MX150 - loud fan when gaming - the poor webcam position - user unfriendly ssd upgrade (under heatpipe) - soldered RAM - no pen support,"Other Thoughts:one of the best features - 3:2 screen ratio with very narrow bezels. great idea. but for lots of photographers really need sd card slot. very mixed feelings about the product. this laptop would be the winner if the company decided to add an sd card slot and two internal SD slots to it (1st ssd - os, 2nd - user files, booting could be from 1st ssd or from 2nd ssd - choosing from BIOS) and also fix the cons above",3,4
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Exactly what I was looking for,2018-05-20,Pros:- the 3:2 aspect ratio was key in my decision- touchscreen- lightweight with decent battery,Cons:- Can get quite hot but no worse then other ultrabooks i've used- webcam quality is low but I don't use it anyways- weird out of the box partitions,Other Thoughts:I do most of my work on a Desktop but on occasion need a laptop for travel. My x230t was not cutting it anymore and I was in the market for an ultrabook that was good for productivity. I ended up going with the Matebook X Pro mostly due to the 3:2 touch screen  and have not been disappointed with it since.  The only tip I have for people is  if you do reformat and re-partition make sure you install all the intel drivers from the site.  It took me a day to get the fingerprint reader to work again and it only did so installing Intel management engine drivers.,10,1
Lenovo,81B1001GUS,5,Fantastic laptop for the price if you get it on sale.,2019-01-13,Pros:Ryzen! Excellent performance. Running Sysbench with all threads 100% and the laptop does not get loud neither does it get hot. Maybe ryzen is just really well optimized to calculate prime numbers? Either way impressive performance for a laptop.,Cons:Only two USB ports.The touchpad does not work with multiple Linux distros I have run on it (Ubuntu 18 and Parrotsec). Working on a fix but so far haven't got it to work.Have started a topic in the Lenovo forums for the touchpad issue here:https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-C-E-K-M-N-and-V-Series/V330-14ARR-touchpad-not-working-for-Linux-amd64/td-p/4328988And a more exhaustive discussion of touchpad issues to include further links at parrotsec forums:https://community.parrotsec.org/t/mouspad-not-working-lenovo-v330-14arr/5224,Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this product.,2,0

Hit F9 to optimize settings and F10 to save.This fixed it for me. The laptop works well.","Cons:All drivers were lost after Manufacturers BIOS update. You can't do anything aside from log into the computer.Edit: Overall I'm pleased with the functionality of the laptop but not the experience. I had to spend the first several hours of ownership troubleshooting issues. Even with most of them solved, the biggest Con for me is the fan. It cranks up often even when the CPU is lower than 20%. The computer is staying cool but the fan is annoying. Will update if I find a good fix.",Other Thoughts:Probably would not buy again...

After rebooting the network adapter no longer works, both WiFi and wired. Windows could not recognize the devices, and of course without networking no Internet to find some working driver.- Cannot find this product on Lenovo's website. Similar named ones are out there including an Intel based laptop, but no mention of this AMD based laptop.- For the couple hours I did run it before upgrading the BIOS I found the fan irritatingly noisy.","Other Thoughts:- If you are a hardcore AMD dude looking for a budget laptop you'll probably be able to keep this working and be satisfied.- For everyone else, just avoid it unless you like driver issues.",0,2

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away.

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight.

My previous laptop was 5 years old, was held together by duct tape, and overheated when plugged in. :) So really, any functioning laptop is good to me. I've only had this laptop for a few days, so here goes nothing with my first review!As for pros:-Beautiful, large display! I'm not savvy about colors and video quality, but 4k videos look beautiful on it, in my opinion-Sound quality is loud and crisp!-You can change the brightness level of the lights behind the keyboard, which is nice-Very lightweight laptop!

It's so sleek and aesthetic!-Keyboard works fine and it's easy to type with-As for gaming, I've only played Don't Starve and Monster Prom (yes don't judge me). The games run well and works fine to me.","Cons:Minor things:-The fan sounds annoyed me a lot. Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Good At First,2018-10-07,"Pros:Lightweight, good looking, fast.",Cons:Major power issue getting worse.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop has begun having some sort of issue which I believe may be related to power. My screen randomly goes black and then comes back. Other times it goes black and I have to hard power down the entire laptop and then restart. Sometimes just after turning on my laptop and launching a web browser with a few tabs (nothing else running) it starts giving me memory errors and crashes Chrome. I have to restart the laptop and then everything is fine.Recently when the screen went black I got the blue windows screen and the error said ""Stop Code: INTERNAL_POWeR_ERROR"". This is happening once or twice a week now. I will not be buying another Asus laptop that's for sure. Wish I had stuck with Lenovo.",2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Very poor LCD quality,2018-07-25,"Pros:- On paper, this laptop has decent processor , hard drive, and video card specs.","Cons:- However, the screen quality is absolutely terrible for an $800 pc. Do not get this pc if you are planning on doing any photo editing or movie viewing or graphic design. Despite numerous attempts to calibrate the color, I couldn't get it anywhere to a usable state. For example, I was looking at one image which I knew was orange but the monitor showed a dull brown color instead. The color accuracy on this is worse than my $400 HP laptop. I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Great computer, easy setup, very fast!",2018-07-24,"Pros:The computer is fast, and when I say fast, I really mean its fast! Boot up and turning off is instant. Everything opens super quick due to the SSD and the quad core i5 (8th Gen). The keyboard is perfect for typing especially having it be backlit helps. The design of the computer is nice, battery life is decent but could be better (what do you expect from a 3cell batt). The top of the computer when closed is not gold, its silver. Its a nice brushed aluminum silver. Fingerprint sensor is handy for signing in very quickly. Barely any bloatware!","Cons:No problems so far:The computer is a little ""plasticy."" It's basically all plastic all around the computer except the top of it when closed. The plastic is very delicate so be careful with watches, etc. Took me a little bit to get used to the touch pad, its little off but after some mouse setting adjustments with sensitivity I was able to get it going well.Webcam is very basic, but I don't use it at all.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend it.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Surprisingly good,2018-07-17,"Pros:battery life: I only use my laptop at night, about 3 hours per day; on one Friday night I finally found that my laptop had been unplugged during the whole week. I watched youtube and did a little bit of coding, not so hardcore but some typical grad student work load. The battery life just surprised me.weight: a 15-inch laptop in my bag, easy peasyports: this one comes with hdmi port, sd card reader, and 3 usb ports; compared to other lightweight laptops this is impressive. no more stupid expensive adapters.heat: so far I've never felt it","Cons:speaker: it works, but not impressive",,3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Lemon Laptop Nightmare,2018-06-22,Pros:Seemed like a good laptop at first..,"Cons:Laptop was purchased 12Apr18 as a gift for my fiancee and it's now 22Jun18 and the laptop STILL has issues. 1st RMA, as soon as I got it back I fired it up and within minutes it locked up again(Please note that I had to PAY ship back a NEW RMA laptop). 2nd RMA after getting it back I didn't notice any intimidate issues.. then after running some stress test software, it both hard locked and the screen was stuck flickering which persisted even after a hard power cycle (even into the BIOS). It eventually went away.. now, here I am 2 months later with this NEW LEMON laptop and frustrated to no end and now working to RMA yet a 3rd time.  I'm at the point I want to trash this and be done with the whole thing. Longtime Asus mobo user since 90's, this is the LAST ASUS LAPTOP I WILL EVER PURCHASE.",Other Thoughts:This is actually an updated review.

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Im sure the product is great. everything seemed fine just sucks they cant send me a working version.,2018-06-20,Pros:the screen how it is supposed to come was great. great contrast and color accuracy. has a lot of the features of a much more expensive laptop but remains for the most part a good product. space is great laptop runs quite fast and I would totally be in love if not for the screen issues.,Cons:The problems are more with its shipping. I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Absurd Limited purchasing configuration options,2018-05-05,Pros:Fast machine,Cons:It makes no sense to get just maximum 256 GB M.2 ssd option. I wish I could avoid the Hard drive an the ssd to just get an 1TB ssd. The graphics card has only 2GB video memory an this is very limiting for today apps and games.,Other Thoughts:As it is being sold I could not recommend this product and I already have an Asus laptop,0,18

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good value + ability to upgrade,2018-04-21,"Pros:- Light and well built- Good display- Easy upgradability- Don't let the ""gold"" color turn you off -- t's a very subtle gold.","Cons:- Webcam is pretty poor- Not the best battery life? It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up. And another great experience buying from Newegg, of course.",6,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Excellent laptop!,2018-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful screen, nice keyboard, especially the dedicated Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys on the side, speedy 8th Gen CPU, decent battery life, light weight.","Cons:The Power button next to the Delete Key...  I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry. I have been using Dell laptops for many years, the last one was a Inspiron 7000.   I don't like the newer Dell keyboards.Well done Asus!!",8,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away. Great buy, if you were on the edge like me, pull the trigger!",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,Great bang for the buck,2019-02-27,"Pros:It is honestly a beautiful computer, it is very thing and the finish on the back looks really good.its powerful, for these specs I haven't really seen anything else at this price range.the screen is beautifulthe keyboard is greatso far not loud","Cons:the track pad is just plain bad, I've only had it for two days now, and about every 30 minutes it just glitches out for 2 seconds, it's pretty disappointing, but you get what you pay for. When it does work the size and placement are nice, but when it glitches it just does not respond to what you are trying to do.",,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight. It weighs less than the tablet/laptop it replaced.","Cons:-I don't have a complaint yet, but I'm not taxing it very hard, so your mileage may vary.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this for a mid-range laptop if you want it to work smoothly but don't want to spend crazy money on something like a Razer Blade.,1,0

Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Good At First,2018-10-07,"Pros:Lightweight, good looking, fast.",Cons:Major power issue getting worse.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop has begun having some sort of issue which I believe may be related to power. My screen randomly goes black and then comes back. Other times it goes black and I have to hard power down the entire laptop and then restart. Sometimes just after turning on my laptop and launching a web browser with a few tabs (nothing else running) it starts giving me memory errors and crashes Chrome. I have to restart the laptop and then everything is fine.Recently when the screen went black I got the blue windows screen and the error said ""Stop Code: INTERNAL_POWeR_ERROR"". This is happening once or twice a week now. I will not be buying another Asus laptop that's for sure. Wish I had stuck with Lenovo.",2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Very poor LCD quality,2018-07-25,"Pros:- On paper, this laptop has decent processor , hard drive, and video card specs.","Cons:- However, the screen quality is absolutely terrible for an $800 pc. Do not get this pc if you are planning on doing any photo editing or movie viewing or graphic design. Despite numerous attempts to calibrate the color, I couldn't get it anywhere to a usable state. For example, I was looking at one image which I knew was orange but the monitor showed a dull brown color instead. The color accuracy on this is worse than my $400 HP laptop. I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Great computer, easy setup, very fast!",2018-07-24,"Pros:The computer is fast, and when I say fast, I really mean its fast! Boot up and turning off is instant. Everything opens super quick due to the SSD and the quad core i5 (8th Gen). The keyboard is perfect for typing especially having it be backlit helps. The design of the computer is nice, battery life is decent but could be better (what do you expect from a 3cell batt). The top of the computer when closed is not gold, its silver. Its a nice brushed aluminum silver. Fingerprint sensor is handy for signing in very quickly. Barely any bloatware!","Cons:No problems so far:The computer is a little ""plasticy."" It's basically all plastic all around the computer except the top of it when closed. The plastic is very delicate so be careful with watches, etc. Took me a little bit to get used to the touch pad, its little off but after some mouse setting adjustments with sensitivity I was able to get it going well.Webcam is very basic, but I don't use it at all.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend it.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Surprisingly good,2018-07-17,"Pros:battery life: I only use my laptop at night, about 3 hours per day; on one Friday night I finally found that my laptop had been unplugged during the whole week. I watched youtube and did a little bit of coding, not so hardcore but some typical grad student work load. The battery life just surprised me.weight: a 15-inch laptop in my bag, easy peasyports: this one comes with hdmi port, sd card reader, and 3 usb ports; compared to other lightweight laptops this is impressive. no more stupid expensive adapters.heat: so far I've never felt it","Cons:speaker: it works, but not impressive",,3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Lemon Laptop Nightmare,2018-06-22,Pros:Seemed like a good laptop at first..,"Cons:Laptop was purchased 12Apr18 as a gift for my fiancee and it's now 22Jun18 and the laptop STILL has issues. 1st RMA, as soon as I got it back I fired it up and within minutes it locked up again(Please note that I had to PAY ship back a NEW RMA laptop). 2nd RMA after getting it back I didn't notice any intimidate issues.. then after running some stress test software, it both hard locked and the screen was stuck flickering which persisted even after a hard power cycle (even into the BIOS). It eventually went away.. now, here I am 2 months later with this NEW LEMON laptop and frustrated to no end and now working to RMA yet a 3rd time.  I'm at the point I want to trash this and be done with the whole thing. Longtime Asus mobo user since 90's, this is the LAST ASUS LAPTOP I WILL EVER PURCHASE.",Other Thoughts:This is actually an updated review. I had to delete the original review because there doesn't seem to be a way to update.,2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Im sure the product is great. everything seemed fine just sucks they cant send me a working version.,2018-06-20,Pros:the screen how it is supposed to come was great. great contrast and color accuracy. has a lot of the features of a much more expensive laptop but remains for the most part a good product. space is great laptop runs quite fast and I would totally be in love if not for the screen issues.,Cons:The problems are more with its shipping. I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Absurd Limited purchasing configuration options,2018-05-05,Pros:Fast machine,Cons:It makes no sense to get just maximum 256 GB M.2 ssd option. I wish I could avoid the Hard drive an the ssd to just get an 1TB ssd. The graphics card has only 2GB video memory an this is very limiting for today apps and games.,Other Thoughts:As it is being sold I could not recommend this product and I already have an Asus laptop,0,18
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good product for low price very impressive.,2018-04-25,Pros:good and came without having any damage.  brand new item.work windows10 right away and wifi no problem.,Cons:can not find any problem so far.  would perfer to have longer hours of battery if possible.,,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good value + ability to upgrade,2018-04-21,"Pros:- Light and well built- Good display- Easy upgradability- Don't let the ""gold"" color turn you off -- t's a very subtle gold.","Cons:- Webcam is pretty poor- Not the best battery life? It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up. And another great experience buying from Newegg, of course.",6,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Excellent laptop!,2018-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful screen, nice keyboard, especially the dedicated Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys on the side, speedy 8th Gen CPU, decent battery life, light weight.","Cons:The Power button next to the Delete Key...  I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry. I have been using Dell laptops for many years, the last one was a Inspiron 7000.   I don't like the newer Dell keyboards.Well done Asus!!",8,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Powerful for the price,2017-12-08,"Pros:This is almost more power than I know what to do with in a laptop! It's got everything and more I was looking for in the price range: Backlit keyboard, 15"" screen, lightweight, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM (though that may get an upgrade someday), and an 8th gen i7 processor! Most other laptops I was looking at in this range only had an i5, or an older i7. And none of them had a dedicated graphics card. It's fast and beautiful. The battery lasts a good while as long as you're not doing anything too extreme like gaming.","Cons:My ""U"" key has come off. I noticed it came loose on the second day of using it, and I've found that it pops off if I hit it just right (or just wrong, depending on how you look at it.) It pops right back on though. A bit of flex in the center of the body and some minutely imperfect seams suggest a slightly cheaper build quality, but it doesn't seem flimsy. Besides the key, I'm not afraid of it falling apart on me with normal use.","Other Thoughts:The other review may be right about the screen colors, but I haven't noticed it being a huge deal. I haven't done any design work like Illustrator or Photoshop on it yet, but I think I'd manage. If design/art/video is your thing though, you may be safer getting a better screen. Also, there is a webcam, it's just the most simple, low-quality, basic webcam on the market. I won't ever use it though, so no biggie. Also, the trackpad is great for a windows machine. I'm used to Mac trackpads, and usually windows ones are absolute garbage in comparison, but this one holds up.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Great specs for price but...,2017-12-07,"Pros:It is everything you would expect based on the specs (e.g., 8th gen i7, ssd + HD, etc),  but...","Cons:The track pad is the worst! It is jittery like all heck! I've truly never used a worse track pad in my life. In addition, a week into using the laptop the cpu fan started making terrible sounds like a bearing was broken.",Other Thoughts:Also note that there is no webcam. Such an easy thing to include! I returned the laptop and bought a better built laptop with lower specs and I am much happier.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,WONDERFUL LAPTOP if you don't mind the screen,2017-12-02,"Pros:Incredible specs, backlit keyboard, small bezels",Cons:That silly 45% NTSC screen,"Other Thoughts:According to Newegg, 48% of people end up buying this laptop after viewing it. I wanted to share a few things before you're one of them. To start off, if you like the added portability of laptops with 14"" screens, you'll love the fact that, because of the thin bezels, the 15.6"" display is put into a smaller package! The downfall, however, is the 45% NTSC screen. If you do photography or any media editing, you'll quickly discover that the colors displayed by this screen are beyond inaccurate. Remember The Dress, and how people couldn't tell if it was white or blue? (old Internet meme, look it up). Well, I highly suspect it won't look like either to you if you use this screen!Intel has made a great leap with a quad core processor for conventional laptops. The specs on this baby are outstanding, just realize you're getting a not-so-great screen. And the speakers are on the bottom, but you should've known that by now!",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Feature rich Thin and Light,2017-10-25,Pros:I search long and hard to find a balance of features to price and this is the closest thing i could find to my perfect laptop at a price that wouldn't destroy my wallet.  i'm still in shock that Intel finally woke up and has started moving along again and the quad core in a mainstream thin and light is proof.  Having 2 ram slots in a thin and light seems like such premium thing since so many others are soldering the ram on.  I know most can do fine for years on 8 gigs of ram but i've already maxed it out with one of my programs and i'm sure i will upgrade to 16 before too long.  The back lit keyboard is oh so nice and the screen is pretty nice quality.  I know this screen isn't as color accurate as some of the other screens i use but it's close enough for draft work.,"Cons:- Plastic casing around the keyboard is a bit springy and has a bit of movement, nothing crazy mind you.- The Thermal limit is very low on these 8th gen chips and with the just passable cooling on this laptop you will constantly be thermal throttling.  I just don't understand why they would thermal throttle this chip at 71C unless Intel is trying to keep it segmented away from it's HQ line.- The pictures on New Egg are not of this model.  They show a finger print reader and this laptop doesn't come with one.  I hate to put this as a con since it's not listed in the specs but someone should do their homework before posting the wrong model pictures.- Plastic chassis has a few imperfections that stick out although the seams on it are crazy good.(the few imperfections stick out bad since the chassis is just so good looking otherwise)",Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking to pick one of these up for productivity on the go.  Photoshop and Premier are great on this laptop and once i swap out the slow harddrive for another SSD then it will be even better.  This laptop is just so much power for such a small and light device.  Also for those worried about the battery life i can say it holds up very well.  For daily browsing and video watching i'm getting just above 6 hours.  When i start editing video that comes down quickly and i've only edited once so far on battery and in 2 hours i ate up just a bit more than half the battery.Gaming - I save this for last because i know people will want to know can it game and while you shouldn't buy this to game it does have chops to hang in old and new games.  You will have to make sacrifices on resolution and quality to play most games though.  I feel that if the laptop had dual pipes and fans then it could keep up and not thermal limit on such a low limit imposed by intel.,10,0

I cannot for the life of me even here the fans.If you are a Student or a light gamer this is a good buy. with a GTX 1050you should be able to play mobas, etc. e.g. light to med graphic games.You might be able to run some AAA games on low settings but I wouldn'ttry it while on battery.",2,0
ASUS,UX533FD-NS76,5,Great Work Laptop with Decent Gaming Capabilities,2019-01-26,"Pros:This is a medium-large, very thin laptop with a very bright, clear 1920*1080 IPS display, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB NVMe PCIe SSD, Core i7-8565U CPU, and nVidia GTX 1050 Max-Q GPU.The screen and keyboard are the best I've seen on a laptop--the bezel on the screen is very thin, looks like maybe 1/4 inch, and the keyboard has a real numeric keypad on the right side, which is wonderful for typists.For work, productivity, web browsing, and pretty much all routine tasks, this laptop is blazing fast.You can play games on it, but it's not a gaming laptop and its GPU is not the equal of its CPU or SSD.  I tested with the 2016 reboot of DOOM. On OpenGL using all Ultra settings, the game is not really playable, with framerates dropping as low as 15 fps.  All High settings raises that to 25-30, but only on Medium does the game become fluid enough to play well, with framerates in the 45-60 range. Switching to Vulkan only works for the High and below presets, as the 2 GB video RAM isn't enough for Ultra quality.  On both High and Medium quality, framerates are basically the same as with OpenGL.  Note that again, because of the 2 GB video RAM, when using Vulkan,  you have to exit the game and run it again every time you change the quality setting in Vulkan mode.The audio quality on this laptop is good.  with decent volume.  The sound is clear.  At high volume, treble response overwhelms vocal and bass range; the balance is much improved, though still of course weak on the bass side, if you pull the volume down to 50% - 75%.Battery life is very good for a laptop this thin, looks like for browsing and productivity you could have six hours or more.  Do a lot of gaming and that number comes down considerably, my testing indicates three to four hours with heavy gaming.  Still, not bad, as this is almost triple the battery life that my work-provided laptop offers.The display quality is amazing, bright and clear and without much dimming or color shift when viewed from an angle.  There are no stuck or dead pixels on the laptop display.Connectivity is good, with a MicroSD card reader, a SUB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C / DisplayPort combo port, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (USB 2 compatible), and an HDMI port, giving you two options for connecting external video.  Power and charge indicator lights are available on the right side beside the card reader.  The external power connector is also on the right side panel at the very rear.","Cons:A drive activity light would be nice--certainly not a deal-breaker.  There really aren't many other complaints I would have, except for not being a great fan of Windows 10.  I wish Microsoft would stop patterning their OS after their (now defunct) phone design, and design a GUI for a desktop operating system again.The ""case"" deserves mention. The laptop comes with a kind of slip-case cover, almost like a very thin black pillowcase, that secures with velcro.  This isn't my favorite sort of case, and has no handles or carrying straps.  Be careful when putting the laptop in the case that your grip on the laptop doesn't slip.  I recommend replacing the case with a real laptop case.","Other Thoughts:This laptop has high-end features that are appropriate for its price point.  I do wish it had a stronger GPU with more video RAM, but I doubt many people would consider buying this if they are looking primarily for a gaming laptop.This is a powerful laptop packed with the latest technology, and using it is a real pleasure.",3,0
ASUS,UX533FD-NS76,5,Sleek and Spunky,2018-12-12,"Pros:The 8565u was the main feature that sold me, boosting to 4.6, making short work of any applications.  The screen continuing all the way to the hinge gives it a sleek look making it appear as if there is no bezel on the bottom of the screen. No complaints on 16 GB of ram and 512gb SSD, should be plenty.","Cons:No major issues so far only one minor issue that the bugs me, the chassis. I am coming from an XPS 13 and the chassis on it was solid. The aluminum clam-shell design of the XPS is far superior to the plastic chassis of the Zenbook. Whenever I close my labtop and grab it to put it away, feeling the lid of my labtop flex just bugs the hell out of me.","Other Thoughts:I was torn between this or a new XPS. I was leaning towards the XPS 13 because I was familiar with them and didn't have issues before,  but the value of the Zenbook was too much to pass. I got this on sale for 1199 pre-tax, while a similar XPS 13 would have been closer to 1500.",11,0

I was getting 400+MBs through the USB-C ports using a C-A converter to a Corsair GTX 256GB flash drive.  The screen it excellent and bright.  I'm also surprised how cool this seems to stay.",Cons:Not a con but this would have been perfect if it could have had a touchscreen.  I looked for one but there was nothing with the USB3gen2 ports in the system.

ASUS,UX433FA-DH74,4,Great performance and battery in small package with some annoyances,2019-02-03,Pros:- Light and compact (more compacted but slightly thicker than my ux31a zenbook)- Fast due to cpu and nvme ssd- 512GB nvme ssd (Intel ssd 1800 read/1500 write)- Battery performance is good. i can easily get 6hours of decent web browsing activity on YouTube and other tasks.- Solid build quality (doesnt feel it will break)- comes with the USB3.0 GB LAN adapter- ac wifi.,"Cons:- Trackpad is annoying to use!!!! compared to my ux31a and other laptops ive used, this trackpad is a total miss. there are time cursor would just jump in random directions while trying to click on something... so unacceptable. You better use a mouse with this laptop otherwise you will want to return it if this isnt the case.- coil whine or some electrical noise is coming from the left area of the laptop when doing some cpu intensive tasks... annoying (review on other site about this issue states his stopped doing this after 2months of use... hope that is true)- no thunderbolt 3 port ..- Not a touch screen given it is a glossy screen... i would have liked touch screen given this point- the laptop sleeve case uses velcro instead of a magnet. i prefer the magnet like my ux31a has on its sleeve.","Other Thoughts:- Not a Matte screen given it isnt even a touch screen....- the blue color is nice but it is a fingerprint magnet... my ux31a was silver so you could hardly tell any finger prints were on there.- something is odd with the screen. if you go from a dark screen (youtube in dark mode) and then move to a bright one (open windows explorer for example) the image on the while looks a little blurry or grey like...it eventually gets normal bur during that time you notice the screen brightness step-up every second. strange.- the power adapter should of had the plug prongs fold into itself... this one just does not have that ability, shame. i have to say though that it is smaller in size than my ux31a, but that one does have the prongs fold in, guess that is the trade off. oh well.- wish there were more color options, i would have preferred a black option other than the blue.- when i am connected to 2.4GHz wifi i tend to lose connectivity randomly. i have to disconnect and reconnect to get connectivity back. i could be the only one, but anyway to workaround this issue i just use ac (5GHz) wifi..N.B. if you need to update the bios, use the USB2.0 port on the right side of laptop, otherwise it will not be detected by Asus ez flash utility in the bios.",4,0

ASUS,UX433FA-DH74,5,"Thin, light, powerful laptop",2018-12-30,"Pros:This is an awesome laptop.  I knew it was thin and lightweight, but I was still surprised at just how thin it is.  The screen is superb, and I like that it is glassy as I am not fond of dull looking matte screens like my old laptop had.  The best part is the performance.  I was initially concerned about the low power Intel i7 1.8 GHz 4 core 8 thread processor because my 5.5-year-old ASUS laptop had an i7-3632QM 2.2 GHz 4 core 8 thread processor.  Because this newer 8th generation i7 CPU can crank out to 4.6 GHz on a single core when you need that extra power, it totally leaves my old laptop’s CPU (which I was pleased with) in the dust!  The wireless card is super great as well.  It stays connected to my AC1900 802.11ac router at the maximum speed of 866.7 Mbps and never fluctuates.  When I run a speed test of my 400 Mbps Internet connection I always get 400 Mbps or more download rate.","Cons:I must say the only thing I was missing from my perfect laptop wish list was that it comes with Windows 10 Home rather than Windows 10 Pro.  The laptop was not loaded down with bloatware and did not have a 10 GB or so recovery partition, so I resolved this issue quite quickly.  In Windows 10, I went to Settings > Update and Security > Activation and took the “upgrade your edition of Windows” option.   I clicked on the “go to the store” link, logged onto the Microsoft Store, put $100 on my credit card, clicked the install button, waited less than 5 minutes for a few files to load, and then rebooted into Windows 10 Pro.  I think $100 is a little pricey to likely “unlock” Pro features that already exist on the OS image, but it was extremely quick and cheaper than spending about $140 to purchase Windows 10 Pro OEM software or $200 for the Windows 10 Pro full version.","Other Thoughts:I would have liked two USB 3.1 type A ports instead of just one, but that is not a show stopper as I can connect a USB 3 hub if I need extra ports.  The USB type C port is USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) which is a plus as most of the laptops I have looked at only have a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) type C port.   I am not bothered by the slower USB 2.0 port on the right side because I like to use a wireless mouse, so I leave the receiver for that plugged in there.   I spent many hours searching for the perfect 14” laptop and this one truly fits the bill for me.  I would recommend this laptop to (non-gamer) power users like myself.",4,0

ASUS,UX333FA-DH51,5,Finally a true XPS13 competitor!,2018-12-05,"Pros:I just got mine in hand today and the build quality is just rock solid. This new generation is legitimately nice to hold and it's just so incredibly thin and small without any flex. Unlike a lot of the machines in this class it managed to keep a couple USB3.0 ports, so you aren't forced to carry around a USB-C hub. Similarly, it still has a full sized HDMI port as well. Subjectively speaking, the screen is very nice as well, quite bright and the colors look great. Keyboard is good, not too mushy.Biggest pro? PRICE. This is easily as nice (or more so) as the current gen XPS13, with more useful ports, but does it costing something like $300-400 less for a comparable configuration.","Cons:As for what not to like, most of it will be the same as all 13.3 sized devices. It's not the fastest CPU out there, no dedicated GPU for gaming. Neither of which I especially expect on a device this size. A larger SSD option without such a price hike would have been a nice option, but again, that's a similar pricing scheme to similar devices.Also, a full SD card slot would have been preferred over a micro. If someone needs a dedicated SD card port at all, it's probably going to be to offload a full sized card for DSLR cameras. Not a deal breaker though, just going to switch to using micro cards with an adapter in the camera.",Other Thoughts:This is just an excellent all-rounder non-gaming machine with all the portability you could possibly ask for.,5,2

I was not aware that ""solid state hybrid drives"" are a thing. (qv Thinkpad T400). My eyes scanned that too quickly. While somewhere in the back of my brain I knew a 1 TB SSD in a package that totalled $400 was too good to be true, I pulled the trigger anyway. That being said, the hybrid tech works as expected - boot times are MUCH faster. I'm using typical business software (Chrome, Office, GIMP) so actually this is a good fit for me.

ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,"LightWeight, Portable, Fast",2018-12-23,"Pros:Out of the box this laptop felt lightweight and well built. While being small and portable is was very fast and capable for most tasks including some light gaming. While being small and portable the screen features full HD resolution (1920x1080) and the picture is decent. Battery life was 1.5 -  8 hours in my usage cases, depending on if I was watching videos, playing a game (yes it has nVidia graphics so it can run some games), browsing the web, or working on documents. The backlit keyboard is also a welcome addition. When under load the laptop was not too noisy and didn't seem to get all too hot ( though it did get rather warm under continuous loads).  Windows 10 was not too much of a hassle to get setup and running, and the laptop itself didn't seem to be too loaded down with unwanted software or extras. The speakers also sound decent for their size. The SSD is decent speed wise (sata speeds) and just adds to how well the unit runs overall. It came with a small assortment of accessories, such as a USB to LAN dongle, an HDMI dongle, and a storage sleeve. The fingerprint scanner is nice when it works (see cons).","Cons:I don't have too many complaints about this laptop, however I will list a few things. To start with I don't like having to use dongles since they are sometimes an easy thing to lose. The next would have to be that McAfee came pre-installed on the machine, granted this is a personal preference, I removed it as it has caused me trouble in the past. After that the only other issue I had with software was that after Windows updated, the fingerprint scanner is not always responsive so I found myself typing the password in if I locked the machine, or if it went to sleep, on a fresh reboot it works every time. Noise wise I did notice a very tiny amount of hissing or what people call coil whine if I was close to the laptop when it was under a heavy load (in my case watching a movie laying on my couch). And finally my last nit-pick would be that the top being so glossy and snazzy as it is, it is a total fingerprint magnet and needs wiped down quite a bit. I don't feel it deserves to lose an egg since some of this is personal preference and different usages cases would yield different results.","Other Thoughts:I used this laptop now for about 4 weeks, it has been stable and fast. It's very portable and light. And while it's not a gaming machine, it was able to play some games and handled multimedia, like Youtube, very well. It would be nice if the memory was upgradable, and I could ask for some more ports, but these are the sacrifices made to have an ultra-portable computer. I cannot fault it since it runs fast and is very stable for how much power they have packed into such a small and lightweight machine. I could easily recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a portable, yet high powered laptop, having an i7 and an SSD just make working on it nice and quick with very few if any hiccups. Lastly I will say that it can play games, and will get warm and throttle when doing so, however it's not sold as a gaming laptop, so I have no real complaints with it. It has been a joy to use during all of my testing.Did a little bench-marking as well, results as follows:Geekbench 4 reported the following:Single Core Score: 4755Multi-Core Score: 14372OpenCL Score: 46497Crystal Disk Mark 6.0.2 (with a 4GiB test file) reported the following:Seq Q32T1 Read 556.3 MB/s  Write 454.9 MB/s4KiB Q8T8  Read 396.3 MB/s  Write 280.7 MB/s4KiBQ32T1 Read 196.5 MB/s  Write 201.1 MB/s4KiB Q1T1  Read 25.39 MB/s  Write 47.71 MB/s",3,0

One time I woke up to find that while the computer was sleeping and charging, it had a Windows crash (blue screen error) and it was way too hot to touch and fanning like a leaf-blower which had me concerned that it could have started a fire.","Other Thoughts:Basically, it's a great computer but has these annoying issues which should not happen at this price point, period.

ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,Powerful performance at a good price and great form factor,2018-11-16,"Pros:Out of the box the computer was not charged at all so make sure to plug it in when you get it.Once I charged it and got it up and running it was the standard windows 10 setup which was painless.The first thing that I did was install chrome and download steam.I tested the computer out by playing civilization VIIt handled the task wonderfully, I had no problem with the quality or the frame-rate even as I progressed through the game and the world became more complicated. While it's not the same quality as my desktop I don't expect that out of this form factor.The size of the laptop is also wonderfully laid out. The screen has a minimal bezel which allows for more screen space with the smaller form factor.Overall this laptop does not let down in terms of performance, the video card paired with the nvidia graphics provide performance in a small form factor along with providing decent battery life on top of that too.",Cons:Your standard issues for any pre installed windows os by including random bloatware. Mcafee is installed and that in itself is more of a virus than antivirus platform in my opinion.One of the other cons is that the top of the laptop is a massive finger print magnet. It is impressive how well fingerprints show up on it. For some that might be really annoying but I couldn't justify taking off any eggs for that.,Other Thoughts:Overall this is a solid offering from Asus. I remember when the first ZenBook came out and I really wanted one. I never had the opportunity to buy one but after reviewing this one I regret not making that more of a priority instead of using arguably mediocre laptops in the meantime.I think this is a solid offering for the price point and the performance. The only thing that I would have liked to see improved is the size of the SSD.,3,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,Great looking featherweight laptop for light to medium workloads,2018-11-15,"Pros:Gorgeous metallic blue finish.Incredibly light, yet very sturdy.Fast and responsiveThere is a USB port on both sides, although only the one on the left is USB3.  There is a USB-C port on left side.Wired Ethernet (via an included adapter) and a wired monitor (micro HDMI, or use the included adapter to convert to standard HDMI) are supported.  There is also an SD card reader, although it is only half as fast as when the same SD card was tested in my desktop.The built-in speakers are surprisingly good, as is the built-in camera.  I really like that there is a small light next to the camera lens that indicates when the camera is in use.I love the fact that there are no air intake vents on the bottom of this laptop since those are so easy to block.  I also love that the hot air exhaust is in the back, aiming up, rather than on the side, cooking my hand as I use a mouse.  The cooling fan (or fans) are dead quite, but I would have preferred better cooling even at the expense of a little of that silence.Goes into and comes out of sleep mode instantly.  So quickly, in fact, I wonder if it is really going completely to sleep.  Like the light in your refrigerator, the screen is on and you're ready to go by the time it is open enough to see it.It comes with a nice carrying pouch, but it is not padded and has no room for the power pack or any of the included adapters.  It will prevent the finish from being scratched when you put it in a backpack, though.","Cons:I hate that Asus and others create special versions of their products for each retailer like this Newegg Exclusive.  It makes it very difficult to compare prices and features, and even harder to find the actual specs.  For example, can the memory be upgraded on this?  You'll never know unless you can figure out how to get it open.  From what I can tell, in addition to the 9 tiny screws on the bottom, you also have to get the rubber feet off the bottom to expose more screws.  Those feet are so well secured, I was afraid I would damage the computer or injure myself so I gave up.  Online comments indicate that the memory cannot be upgraded, but that the M.2 SSD can, although you're back to getting the back cover off.  I wonder if the battery is replaceable?The cooling is seriously insufficient unless you're only going to be doing light-duty work.  Why put an i7 in there if it cooks itself when you actually use it?  After only 10-15 minutes of playing a game that kept the CPU at around 45%, with the laptop on a table, the CPU temperature was in the mid to high 70's (170F), and the bottom of the laptop was almost too hot to touch.  Even the table under the laptop was hot to the touch.  Because the bottom gets so hot, there is no way you could ever use this for any amount of time on your lap.I really don't like the placement of the power button.  It is in the upper right corner of the keyboard, right above the backspace key and right next to the delete key.  Fortunately, since the computer is so fast, it comes right back on after you accidentally hit it, again and again.  You can disable this button in the additional settings section of the power options control panel if you want to.I was  disappointed to find out that this particular version of the ZenBook14 doesn't have the illuminated touch-pad numeric keypad that is all the talk on the ASUS web page.This laptop has quite a large wall-wart power pack, that while rated for 100-240V (50-60Hz), it has a NEMA 1-15 plug that is only suitable for US outlets.  Every other laptop I have ever used has a short region specific cord that goes between the power brick and the outlet, making it more flexible.There is a lot of pre-installed junk on this laptop.  From games like Candy Crush and Mind Craft to trial versions of the entire Microsoft Office suite, there is a lot of wasted disk space here.  It's all easy enough to uninstall though.","Other Thoughts:A PassMark performance test easily shot the CPU temperature to 93C (200F) and drove the GPU temperature to 74C (166F), despite providing only 25 fps in the 3D tests.  At the end of the several minute test, the left side of the keyboard was 42C (108F), and the bottom was 38C (100F).  PassMark gave this laptop (while plugged in) a rating of 3838 and put it in the 78th percentile.  I was surprised by how poorly the memory tested (57th percentile) until I did some research and found it appears to only have DDR3 memory, which seems strange for a gen 8 processor.If you are mostly looking for a light to medium duty, featherweight laptop for surfing the web, watching videos, or using Office-like apps, then this laptop will work great for you.  It will handle heavier work loads for short periods, but I would be afraid of it overheating if used hard for a long time.",8,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,4,Lightweight Premium Build Quality!,2018-11-07,"Pros:Powerful lightweight notebook that is great for everyday use, light/medium video/photo editing, playing/streaming multi-media and even some light/medium gaming!NO bloatware installed, only Asus utilities.Nice 1.4mm travel distance on the keyboard keys.Touch-pad works great and is very responsive, no lag!Amazing matte finish screen completely reduces any glare!Wide viewing angle is perfect when screen sharing with others!Down-firing Harmon/Kardon speakers produce crystal clear sound, and there is no distortion when the volume is turned up.SanDisk X600 series SSD, 256G, M.2 2280 with a sequential read/write of 550/525 is right on with a few Crystal Disk tests I ran, which showed 555 read and around 510 write consistently.No fan ports on bottom or sides. The cooling port is nicely tucked away in the hinge area of the notebook, wherever you are using it there is no need to worry about blocking a ventilation port.Long battery life! I ran this all day alternating between some light gaming, browsing, and streaming videos for a few hours and still had power left to burn. At around 4% the computer will shut down, and it only took about 2 hours to fully charge it to 100% again.The top cover is an eye catching piece of artwork. While it is a fingerprint catcher, you could always find a custom full cover decal to protect it, or try a large generic clear screen protector which may help with fingerprints.Ram cannot be changed out or upgraded; the M.2 SSD can be changed to a larger capacity if you need more space.I have not experienced coil whines, or loud fan issues on the notebook that I tested, even after hours of using it.",Cons:The fingerprint scanner does not work 100% of the time. Not sure if this is a Windows problem or the scanner pad.,"Other Thoughts:If you want to try squeaking more out of the GPU try using Asus GPU Tweak II. It offers one-click custom overclocking with detailed information about the GPU. It can be found on their website.Current Bios version is 305 released 8/16/2018. On their support site, this bios show’s up under the UX430UNR model and not under the UX430UN model.If you want more storage and memory check out the ZenBook UX430UA which has twice as much storage and memory but will cost a lot more!LPDDR3 memory is soldered to the board so the laptop can be made thinner and lighter which allows more space for the largest possible battery. And with lower power consumption it creates less heat while helping extend battery life.Pay attention when using USB-C, as it can also fit into the mini HDMI port!Make sure you pull down all the updates right out of the box before you start using this notebook!!",3,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,4,Very capable Ultrabook that can keep up with the best.,2018-11-01,"Pros:This particular Asus UX430UN has two ideal uses when everything is taken into consideration. 1. Home multimedia (movies, music) & graphical use (photography). 2. Business use with ultimate portability and increased durability requirement.+ Gorgeous matte screen with fantastic color reproduction. The quality of the screen is right in line with the best Ultrabooks. With the screen not having a glossy finish as on most other laptops, the colors may not look quite as rich.+ As somewhat of an overall trend of manufacturers moving from 14” screens to 13.3”, this laptop maintains the larger 14” display with slim bezels. This allows for increased productivity meanwhile keeping the ultimate portability.+ Speakers are second to none in the Ultrabook market. Asus had the space and took advantage of it to install the largest speakers they could. The sound in movies and music is extremely natural and is actually pleasant to listen to. With that being said, even though the speakers are remarkable for an Ultrabook, they will not be replacing any dedicated external speakers.+ Fan noise is much more muted than that of the competition. The laptop prioritizes lower noise over thermals. This is both a pro and a con depending on the ultimate end use / longevity. The processor has a thermal limit of 100*C and the laptop will routinely hit 98*C when under heavy load. The fan will definitely be audible at such loads, but the ramping up will be more gradual than found on the competition’s high performance Ultrabooks.+ Lap friendly design with no cooling vents on the bottom of the laptop. The same cannot be said for most of the competition where such use will block the cooling vents and cause the laptop to run much hotter.+ The base of the laptop is aluminum, the bezel around the screen is plastic, and the lid is a “glass-like” finish. What you essentially get is a laptop that is more forgiving to accidental bumps and better cooling potential due to the aluminum base. Touchscreen laptops on the other hand have glass screens that are much more prone to cracking when bumped or dropped.+ Ambient light sensor for screen brightness control. Upon receipt of the laptop, the maximum brightness of the screen may look dim with the setting turned on. When, turning it off by pressing FN + A key, actual maximum brightness can be achieved.+ Concealed exhaust and intake fan vents for an overall clean look.+ Backlit keyboard with 3 levels of brightness.+ Provided are a laptop sleeve, a Micro HDMI-to-HDMI adapter, and a USB-to-LAN adapter.","Cons:The cons listed should not be deal breakers, but should be taken into consideration when comparing with competitors’ offerings.- Audible coil whine from the motherboard when doing any processor intensive tasks. When fan is on low speed or off, the whine is very much noticeable.- Soldered RAM (8GB) on the motherboard with no option to replace / upgrade to higher capacity.- SATA Based 256GB Sandisk SSD is used in lieu of NVMe based SSD. Even though the slot on the motherboard will allow for SSD upgrades to higher capacity ones, NVMe based drives will not be compatible and cannot be used. To put the raw speed between the two types of drives in perspective, the SATA SSD will top out at around 550MB/s, NVMe SSD will top out at around 3,500MB/s.- Power button is placed above the Backspace key. With the default settings in place, it will put the computer to sleep when pressed. Luckily the default action of the power button can be set to “Do Nothing” within Windows.- Throttling of the processor during prolonged high demand loads. Due to the cooling space constraints, the laptop will slow down to keep it from overheating. This is the case with every other Ultrabook on the market which come with a Core i5-8250u or i7-8550u processor.- The top of the lid has an extremely shiny finish to it that is very much susceptible to scuffs and scratches, and extra care needs to be taken to keep it clean. The new laptop arrived with two noticeable scratches already on the lid. The top should have been kept aluminum with no additional finishes just as found on the aluminum base.- USB port is slightly shorter than standard, this means that anything the user may plug in will stick out a bit more than it should. Wireless mouse receivers that are usually left plugged in will have a higher chance of catching and damaging the USB port.- The fingerprint reader is located on the touchpad. It should have been placed elsewhere on the palm rest or integrated into the power button as on some competitors’ laptops.- No way to cycle the Fn key with F-Key functionality. The only way to change settings such as volume, screen brightness, keyboard backlighting, etc. via the keyboard is to hold down the Fn Key and press the appropriate F-Key. In instances where the user adjusts such settings more often than using the actual F1-F12 keys, there should be an option to just press the appropriate F-key.- Somewhat of an oddity, when the screen is turned off due to inactivity or pressing Fn + F7 key to turn it off, the laptop will turn off the WIFI and act as if it’s half-asleep. If listening to online radio, it will continue playing what has been buffered to that point and then stop due to a lack of network connection. Moving the mouse or pressing any key will prompt you with the login screen. The network connection immediately gets reestablished and the online radio is resumed. Similarly, when doing a large download and leaving the PC unattended, the download will fail when the screen is turned off. This happens with all Sleep settings in the Power Options set to Never. As of right now the only way to avoid this happening is by disabling the Screen Power Off settings and enabling just a Blank screensaver after x amount of time. That of course will reduce the battery life.","Other Thoughts:The following is what is made available on competitors’ Ultrabooks that is not found on this Asus UX430UN: Glossy glass touchscreen with pen support, Fast NVMe SSD, 2-in-1 functions allowing the laptop screen to be rotated 180 degrees and used as a tablet. The additional features will definitely come with a price premium especially when trying to match the exceptional features such as the quad-core i7 processor, 14” screen, and memory on this laptop.As of right now Ultrabook options are abundant and this Asus Ultrabook should not be overlooked.",2,1
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,2,I am not sure...,2018-10-01,Pros:- Super light/thin- Affordable- Relatively good Spec- Nice keyboards,"Cons:- It's 1/2 month-old laptop and it already made the coil noises when updating windows for the first time - concerning.- I have absolutely no idea why but its touchpad freezes for a good minute when loading a webpage on chrome. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!- After spending some time researching, I realised that these issues are common AND unsolvable.- Though it's well-known for a good battery life, I don't experience such long battery life on this.  I haven't gotten a chance to play any games or played videos yet, only websurfing.- Yes, it was GeForce MX150 was one of the main reasons I chose this computer, but apparently it throttles aggressively with high loads (you can easily find other reviews on this issue).","Other Thoughts:- I cannot say that I would recommend this to a friend because of the issues stated above though it's a tempting deal.- I am considering to get an exchange with the same model.

I wasn't a fan of the micro hdmi port since it requires an adapter and the port itself looked to be more susceptible  to damage.

ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,2,i expect more. this should be a 5 star purchase but..,2019-03-08,"Pros:screen  has great quality, lightweight, fast","Cons:screen clarity is  good, but too dark at times. you can play with certain system display settings to make it brighter but kind of a hassle. the real issue is the track pad. it randomly decides to stick and the mouse pointer will be stuck. very frequently, every 5 mins or so of use. the screen issue isnt that big of the deal but the trackpad issue is so annoying I have decided to return this. although it was a great deal for the specs I am still paying way too much money for this laptop to put up with this",,0,2

I am very surprised on it's performance compared to what laptops used to be compared to computers.I mean, I can actually game on it, no issues at all, and at good setting, SSD is very fast, CPU is not quite up there with my home rig with it's i7-7700K OC'd to 4.9 GHz or it's dual OC'd video cards........ But       IT     WILL    GAME         and do so fairly well.I ran this thing through every Torture test I know, even OCCT PSU for 24 hours, and it never blinked an eye. Heck I even had to reinstall windows because of the testing I did HAHA.All in all I find this Laptop acceptable in every aspect, as a Primary Gaming Computer it's not quite up to my standards, but I am an extremist I suppose.

ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,"ASUS ZenBook 15 Intel Whiskey Lake Core i7-8565U, 16 GB DDR4, 512 GB PCIe SSD, GTX 1050 Max-Q, IR Camera, Ultra-Slim Compact15.6"" FHD 4-Way NanoEdge, Windows 10 Laptop - UX533FD-DH74",2019-01-28,"Pros:-Built in IR camera-Intel Whiskey Lake Core i7-8565U-16 GB DDR4-512 GB PCIe SSD-GTX 1050 Max-Q-TrackpadI really like how the track pad buttons are literally part of the track pad, instead of them being beveled like most track pads.As the bevels tend to get gunk built up in them over time.-Back-lit KeyboardHonestly this should be a standard on all laptops.

Yes this whole laptop is a finger print magnet.-BatteryBetter than most laptops this size from 2018 and prior. Batteries have come a long way.-Power cordIt may sound weird but I really like this square black charging block. Very compact, Unlikethe older ones I remember.-BloatwareHonestly there was more bloatware installed by default from Microsoft than ASUS.I think all I un-installed was ASUS sync and the dropbox app that works with it.And of course all the Microsoft games that that app store pre-installs.-BiosThe Bios is no frills, But it is full UEFI. And you can boot BOOTX64.EFI from a USB devicefrom the setup menu. There is no fan controls, or anything else interesting to tweak in the bios.it is definitely bare bones on options.

ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,Great Work Laptop with Decent Gaming Capabilities,2019-01-26,"Pros:This is a medium-large, very thin laptop with a very bright, clear 1920*1080 IPS display, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB NVMe PCIe SSD, Core i7-8565U CPU, and nVidia GTX 1050 Max-Q GPU.The screen and keyboard are the best I've seen on a laptop--the bezel on the screen is very thin, looks like maybe 1/4 inch, and the keyboard has a real numeric keypad on the right side, which is wonderful for typists.For work, productivity, web browsing, and pretty much all routine tasks, this laptop is blazing fast.You can play games on it, but it's not a gaming laptop and its GPU is not the equal of its CPU or SSD.  I tested with the 2016 reboot of DOOM. On OpenGL using all Ultra settings, the game is not really playable, with framerates dropping as low as 15 fps.  All High settings raises that to 25-30, but only on Medium does the game become fluid enough to play well, with framerates in the 45-60 range. Switching to Vulkan only works for the High and below presets, as the 2 GB video RAM isn't enough for Ultra quality.  On both High and Medium quality, framerates are basically the same as with OpenGL.  Note that again, because of the 2 GB video RAM, when using Vulkan,  you have to exit the game and run it again every time you change the quality setting in Vulkan mode.The audio quality on this laptop is good.  with decent volume.  The sound is clear.  At high volume, treble response overwhelms vocal and bass range; the balance is much improved, though still of course weak on the bass side, if you pull the volume down to 50% - 75%.Battery life is very good for a laptop this thin, looks like for browsing and productivity you could have six hours or more.  Do a lot of gaming and that number comes down considerably, my testing indicates three to four hours with heavy gaming.  Still, not bad, as this is almost triple the battery life that my work-provided laptop offers.The display quality is amazing, bright and clear and without much dimming or color shift when viewed from an angle.  There are no stuck or dead pixels on the laptop display.Connectivity is good, with a MicroSD card reader, a SUB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C / DisplayPort combo port, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (USB 2 compatible), and an HDMI port, giving you two options for connecting external video.  Power and charge indicator lights are available on the right side beside the card reader.  The external power connector is also on the right side panel at the very rear.","Cons:A drive activity light would be nice--certainly not a deal-breaker.  There really aren't many other complaints I would have, except for not being a great fan of Windows 10.  I wish Microsoft would stop patterning their OS after their (now defunct) phone design, and design a GUI for a desktop operating system again.The ""case"" deserves mention. The laptop comes with a kind of slip-case cover, almost like a very thin black pillowcase, that secures with velcro.  This isn't my favorite sort of case, and has no handles or carrying straps.  Be careful when putting the laptop in the case that your grip on the laptop doesn't slip.  I recommend replacing the case with a real laptop case.","Other Thoughts:This laptop has high-end features that are appropriate for its price point.  I do wish it had a stronger GPU with more video RAM, but I doubt many people would consider buying this if they are looking primarily for a gaming laptop.This is a powerful laptop packed with the latest technology, and using it is a real pleasure.",3,0
ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,Sleek and Spunky,2018-12-12,"Pros:The 8565u was the main feature that sold me, boosting to 4.6, making short work of any applications.  The screen continuing all the way to the hinge gives it a sleek look making it appear as if there is no bezel on the bottom of the screen. No complaints on 16 GB of ram and 512gb SSD, should be plenty.","Cons:No major issues so far only one minor issue that the bugs me, the chassis. I am coming from an XPS 13 and the chassis on it was solid. The aluminum clam-shell design of the XPS is far superior to the plastic chassis of the Zenbook. Whenever I close my labtop and grab it to put it away, feeling the lid of my labtop flex just bugs the hell out of me.","Other Thoughts:I was torn between this or a new XPS. I was leaning towards the XPS 13 because I was familiar with them and didn't have issues before,  but the value of the Zenbook was too much to pass. I got this on sale for 1199 pre-tax, while a similar XPS 13 would have been closer to 1500.",11,0

Productivity with the capability for gaming on the side! The camera on the bottom does kind of blow but to be honest, I never use the camera so it doesn't bother me at all. The keyboard is really tactile and you have to press hard to have it register, but I like my keyboards like that so it's fine for me.

Its perfect for me as I am a student that is majoring in 3D Animation so the load that this computer will be able to handle is perfect for 3D programs and I have the necessary battery life to get me through my other classes for the whole day. Even if you have to bring the charging cable (probably won't), the block is really thin and small so it's not even that bad. This laptop is really just the perfect fit for me. Productivity with the capability for gaming on the side! The camera on the bottom does kind of blow but to be honest, I never use the camera so it doesn't bother me at all. The keyboard is really tactile and you have to press hard to have it register, but I like my keyboards like that so it's fine for me.

ASUS,C223NA-DH02-RD,2,"Good price, but cheap components",2019-02-08,"Pros:Price, tho' the ASUS E203 (win10) can be had for around $150. The keyboard has a decent feel to it, and the chassis is pretty good for this price point. Processor speed is adequate, as is the 4GB RAM. As for the screen, I like that it's anti-glare, but that's about it.","Cons:eMMC storage is slow.The USB-A slot would only read about half of my storage sticks.The BIOS wouldn't hold the dev_boot_legacy flag after the system was suspended.'Search' key where the 'Caps Lock' should be. No 'Delete' key.  Other keys missing.ChromeOS doesn't do quite what I want it to.This is probably the WORST TN screen I have seen.  There's no such color as black on this display, just washed out grays. Off angle viewing, even by just a few degrees, is terrible.  It reminds me of the first gen laptop displays back in the 90's.","Other Thoughts:If you're just a casual user, this may be fine, just don't expect to see a stunning display, nor do much outside of the browser. Outdoor use is out of the question, unless it's midnight with a new moon.The ChromeOS didn't give me the flexibility I needed to use this as a telecommute and light programming device, so I installed linuxmint 19.1 cinnamon (pretty much my plan before I even ordered the thing).  The install was pretty straightforward, following the instructions found on the net for enabling developer mode and legacy boot. I chose to overwrite the entire chromeos knowing I wouldn't use it again. I was wrong. After suspending the system overnight, I couldn't wake/reboot it the next morning because the dev_legacy_boot flag got set back to zero.  Thanks, ASUS.  To boot I had to edit a script inside a recovery image so that instead of rewriting chromeos on top of my fresh linuxmint installation it would simply set the flag back to one.  The E203 model is perhaps a better choice if you're going to run Linux, as it looks more like a normal PC. However, you're stuck paying the Micro$oft tax with the E203.",1,0

Most people won't need to upgrade, but the option is nice to have.","Other Thoughts:- Battery life is good, but not fantastic; heavy use throughout the day would require you to use the charger. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as I consider myself a power user. I'm often watching movies, streaming content, and prefer to keep the brightness high, so this is the laptop rarely gets a break- The IO is good, but needs some work, with the right hand side of the laptop sporting a single USB 2.0 port. I would have gladly traded that in for a second USB - C port. However, the HDMI is a welcome sight, as it's getting difficult to find this on many laptops nowadaysOverall, fantastic laptop, especially for the price. The lack of upgradeability and still having USB 2.0 knock it down a point, but it's still a solid 4/5",0,0

For example, gaming (no ray tracing and always trailing behind Nvidia), and AMD CPU's (while cheaper) typically run hotter and slower than Intel. But... and this is a big But... discrete graphics (separate CPU and GPU) in the thin and light segment is stupid, which is why AMD finally has at least one market cornered with this APU. This thing will more than double the graphics performance of anything embedded within an Intel CPU, and will run for hours in a thin and light laptop with a small battery. There's a reason gaming laptops are HUGE. And there's a reason Intel is partnering with AMD for Intel's upcoming ""G"" series APUs. If you can't beat them, partner with them.)- Design (Sure it's a knock-off MacBook but go ahead and walk through your local electronics store and just look (and feel) the laptops they're selling for $549.

Wouldn't recommend for anyone who codes or types a lot.Ports. HDMI, USB C, 2 USB, headphone jack. a bit skimpy but accessories can alwasys be purchased for cheap.","Other Thoughts:Good function keys, nice to be able to turn off internet connection if needed fastDidn't have much hope that the laptop would be good. Very impressed, was not expecting the quality for the price. If you are upgrading from an older machine and worried about the 8gb of ram, the higher clock speeds do help with most tasks comapred to an older ddr3 ram setup.",2,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Fantastic Value,2019-02-07,"Pros:Don't let the price tag fool you - this is no mediocre ""budget"" laptop. The IPS display is stunning. Aluminum body and ultra slim bezels add to the stylish look. I don't use the touch screen much but it works fine. The touch pad is large and in charge. I love the keyboard too.I'm one of those people who has thirteen tabs of Google Chrome open at the same time, and this computer has had no trouble keeping up.","Cons:Any cons on this machine are severely outweighed by that ridiculous price. This model doesn't include a fingerprint reader. The fan runs a lot when it's updating or if you've got too much stuff going on. (It pretty quiet, though. Nothing to worry about.) The webcam is decent, but only decent.One thing I can't figure out is how to turn on the keyboard back light. I've tried every shortcut and settings tab, but nothing. I know it's capable because the keyboard lights up every time it wakes up or turns on. I'm sure I'm just missing some simple solution.","Other Thoughts:If you're worrying all this sounds to good to be true, just buy it! Tremendous value. I enjoy using this laptop.",2,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Ryzen from the grave!,2019-02-02,Pros:It has a screen. It has a keyboard. Its a laptop. You use it and then you toss it.This is the best Ryzen laptop on the market in terms of heat management. Doesn't throttle near as bad as what Lenovo or HP have to offer.You are paying under 550 for a MacBook like experience. You might love that or you might not.,"Cons:It is not aluminum. The casing is soft, probably some type of Zinc mixture.",,2,2
Huawei,53010BLA,4,Good midrange laptop,2019-02-01,"Pros:I spent a long time researching laptops, I was not seeking a gaming or particularly high end use case.  This meets all of my requirements at a reasonable cost.I would recommend the AMD version for the cost savings.  The AMD version does indeed have a functioning touchscreen (despite the newegg listing) which I am sold on having.   There is no fingerprint scanner in the AMD version, despite what multiple youtube reviewers would tell you.","Cons:-Sound quality is fairly tinny, but not unusable.-No IR light for Windows Hello, meaning you'll need to use a PIN/password to unlock every time.-Screen could be brighter, I frequently have it at 100% indoors.",Other Thoughts:Pick it up if you want a solid daily use computer and do not need the top of the line ultrabook cost.  I've recommended it to students/colleagues that are looking for a macbook alternative.,2,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Attractive Design - Great multitasking - Bang for your buck,2019-02-01,"Pros:The Huawei Matebook D is a very impressive laptop for the price. The metal construction feels very premium, the keys are solid, the screen is bright and vibrant.The touchscreen is very responsive and have had no issues with it whatsoever.It’d be tough to find another laptop that looks and feels as premium for ~ $530.As far as performance, the 8GB RAM paired with the Ryzen 5 provides a quick and snappy experience for everything I’ve used it for - Excel, Access, Internet browsing, YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, etc. Using several of these apps at the same time makes no difference; everything is consistently smooth and fast.Battery life is consistently around 8 hrs for me with moderate to low brightness and regular app usage.The SSD with OS installed provides a quick boot and startup every time.Overall, very impressed with the Matebook D and would buy it again in a heartbeat. Huawei has earned my respect and future business.",Cons:None whatsoever.,"Other Thoughts:For $529, you get a laptop with a sturdy, premium look and feel with impressive performance and great battery life.

Huawei,53010BLA,5,Outstanding Value,2019-01-30,"Pros:- great keyboard, very nice screen and build quality- thin and light chassis with above average battery life",Cons:- webcam is weak,Other Thoughts:this is a solid aluminum notebook with backlight keyboard and touch-screen.no fingerprint scanner on mine though,1,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Excellent value,2019-01-15,Pros:solid constructionnice screen albeit glossyexcellent specslimited bloatwareideal size/weight for college daughterEasy to update all drivers at once,"Cons:lack of ports, SD/u-SD reader","Other Thoughts:This was a replacement laptop for my college daughter who dropped her previous laptop and broke the webcam, cracked the entire screen, severely scratched & dented the frame, etc. This is a really nice laptop. The PC Manager did a nice job of updating all drivers in a single swoop. It did take a good 3-4 hours to install all of the recommended Windows Updates (which occurred in 3 waves), but once everything was up and running the laptop performed extremely well. The only issue I had was with the very first Windows update which took forever. The screen would go black and I thought I accidentally turned off the laptop which you are not supposed to do.I cannot comment on things like battery life since the laptop is now with my daughter, but this felt more like a $750+ laptop than a $530 laptop. Solid metal alloy frame. Nice touchscreen. Nice chiclet backlit, spill-resistant keyboard. Upward facing speakers with ample volume. 14"" screen while well under 4 lbs. I would definitely purchase again.Considering what happened to the last laptop, we also purchased the ipearl mcover for the Honor Magicbook 14, which fit perfectly. There was no cover specifically for the Huawei Matebook D 14, but the Magicbook has exactly the same dimensions.",3,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Simply the best all round laptop at this price point.  Amazing!,2019-01-12,"Pros:I'm writing this review on my new MateBook D 14.  I have been looking for a new ultrabook for months and months now and didn't want to break the bank.  Well with this laptop it's a win/win.  On sale at $529 and even at the $550 price this is a no brainer if you are looking for something for productivity and a little gaming.  The Vega Graphics pummel the intel integrated offering and the Ryzen 5, 4 cores and 8 threads even outperform the intel i5 8th gen on some work loads.  The M.2 SSD is easily upgraded if needed.  The battery life so far has been far more than I expected.  The finish and feel of this laptop is solid.  And I was shocked to see there is no irritating bloatware installed.  The only manufacture application is called the PC Manager and it is actually nice to check for driver updates.  Even the SSD partitions are sized to maximize the space on the SSD.  No over the top recovery partition that is sized too big which will waste usable space.The first time startup was clean... I did end up downloading the Windows media creation tool so I would get the latest 1809 built of Windows 10.  No issues with the update as expected.Unless you need the GPU power of  an Nvidia MX150, I just can't see paying the extra $$$ for the Intel platform and the Nvidia graphics?  Another $200-$300 I think?  Not sure if that is an option in this series of laptop.I'm shocked at how cool this runs too.  And for that matter, the screen at 1080p is really nice.  At this size of screen, I don't think you get a huge benefit to jump to 2k or 4k for that matter.  It's designed for productivity with the opportunity to so some gaming on the side.  I'm happy with the 1920x1080 resolution.  Oh, and it's touch screen.  I forgot about the touch screen until after I had everything setup.  I likely won't use the touch screen much, but then again, it's there if you need it.All in all, I'm still shocked at how nice this laptop presents itself.  Down right solid and the finish is beautiful.  As I mentioned earlier, you can't go wrong here at the price point.","Cons:Not sure if this is much of a con, but my last laptop had external volume buttons on the edge... I do kind of miss that, but not worries on getting used to the Windows Key + FKey volume up and down combination.",Other Thoughts:There is a reason that the early reviews of this laptop are a solid stars... they are well deserved!,2,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,Absolutely AMAZING,2019-01-11,"Pros:Super premium build quality (just feels AWESOME to hold)Great keyboard feel (very easy to type fast and accurate)Backlit keyboardLOUD speakers!Thin bezel!Webcam on top!Great battery life! (7-10hrs)Screen is very nice and clear ( colors are great and awesome viewing angles)It's down right gorgeous!Feels like a lighter n thinner macbook pro while performing way better than the macbook air and a quarter the priceAwesome USB-C charging (the charger outputs 5v, 9v, 12v, 15v, and 20v so it can fastcharge ur galaxy phones and all other usb-c electronics!)Best built laptop you can buy under $1200 (compared to non-huawei brands)NO SCREEN FLEX!!!This has definitely boosted my productivity by 2X",Cons:It says it has fingerprint scanner but that's on the other type of matebook Ds (but it really doesn't matter because of how awesome all the other stuff is)Power button is placed on the right side right where I like to pick up my laptop with one hand so I will sometimes turn it off.NOTHING OTHER THAN THAT,"Other Thoughts:I usually buy thin n light gaming laptops (usually over $1800) because I don't see why I should buy an underpowered ultrabook for near $1400. Those gaming laptops always had terribly weak speakers, trackpads, screen flex, and not-so-great screens. This laptop is well worth the money plus some. If I were to price this laptop, I would put it around $1000 (almost twice what I paid for this!)",0,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,US Contraband,2018-12-28,"Pros:Let's face it, there is everything to like about this laptop and no cons. Feels like a premium machine for half the price. I came from a HP Spectre i7500u that didn't have as good a display (bright and crisp), or as good as GPU. I mostly casually game and write, and this computer does both flawlessly. The keyboard is one of the best I've ever used, and the track pad is extremely responsive. Build is extremely sturdy and even though it looks like a MacBook, it's charming in it's own regard. It's also a touch screen, although I could go without it. System is snappy and fast, feels like I have double the RAM even though it's only 8 GB. Extremely satisfied with this laptop, as the hunt has been going for almost a year now and I'm finally very satisfied. I was gaming League and accidentally wasn't plugged in, noticed it about 2 - 3 hours in and still had an hour left on charge. I was skeptical about this laptop but it has exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more pleased. Even the windows 10 is minimal bloatware. Zero driver issues which I was worried about with AMD.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Apparently the US is warning consumers of this brand and Trump is trying to ban them out of the US. I support any brand that delivers quality goods.,9,1
Huawei,53010BLA,5,"Great computer, with some false advertising.",2018-12-28,"Pros:This laptop is basically a Windows Macbook. It has a great aluminum body, great keyboard, beautiful screen (my one definite requirement in a laptop, since I work in graphic design), fast SSD, and a surprisingly good processor. My main use for this laptop will be connecting via remote desktop to my beast of a desktop, and for that purpose, this well exceeds my expectations for the price range. It's nearly a blatant copy of a Macbook, honestly (without the Huawei branding, you'd think it was an Apple), except it runs Windows and has a touchscreen, but if you don't mind the copycat aspect of it, it's wonderful.","Cons:I mentioned false advertising, because the product page says this ships with a fingerprint sensor, but Windows tells me this device does not have one. So, I'm not sure whether it just has one that strangely isn't compatible with the operating system it ships with, or just that it doesn't have one, but I was really looking forward to the fingerprint sensor. I have a Huawei phone, and the fingerprint sensor on that is really phenomenal, so again, I was really looking forward to having that here. But hey, it also said it wasn't a touch screen, and it came with one, so I won't complain too loudly.","Other Thoughts:All in all, this is an really good bargain for what you're getting, and while I'm severely disappointed that I was promised a fingerprint sensor and didn't get one, I cannot in good faith give this laptop less than 5 stars.",1,0
Huawei,53010BLA,5,"So far, amazing, but got touchscreen instead of non-touchscreen with Ryzen 2500U",2018-10-30,"Pros:- Beautiful- Fast SSD- Matched or surpassed all of my specs and price point criteria: ~$600, 8GB RAM, 8th gen intel or comparable Ryzen (which I got), 256 GB SSD, colorful bright screen, decent keyboard, precision touchpad, 13-15"" screen- Has front facing speakers- The F row of keys, like a macbook, by default do functions like volume or screen brightness instead of the F keys, which is super nice. the Fn key turns them ""back"" into F1-F12, similar to a macbook- Screen rotates until it is flat with keyboard, which is really nice- strong, solid hinge, screen doesnt wobble at all when typing.- Full size HDMI port is awesome, as is the connectivity vs a macbook- Minimal bloatware, just one Huawei app that is very easy to uninstall","Cons:Biggest con: was supposed to be without a touchscreen and Ryzen 2500U as per the possible selections, but it came with a touchscreen anyway. I didnt want the touchscreen since it drains battery life constantly whether it is in use or not. Oh well, guess I'll just have to live with it now.- USB C charging cable is kind of short, about 6 feet. I'd 100% recommend buying a longer one if you're going to be bringing this into coffee shops, at least 12 feet.Haven't found any other cons yet. It's a fantastic computer.","Other Thoughts:- It looks exactly like a macbook and I constantly keep checking whether I should be pressing the Cmd key instead of Ctrl for keyboard shortcuts, oops- Fan turns on kind of frequently and is louder than most ""new high end"" laptops. Doesn't bother me though.- Battery life, due to the touchscreen which I never wanted in the first place, is a little worse than I'd like. 6-7 hours instead of something like 7-9 hours. I'll live with it, but wouldve just liked there not to be a touchscreen in the first place.- Just a personal opinion, but the Huawei logo is kinda ugly and looks like NBC or something. I'd like there to be no logo on the back of the laptop. It's ""printed"" on, I think I'll try that sugarcube thing and just scratch it off while not damaging the metal :)",8,1

No backlight keyboard.,Other Thoughts:would be better if it would come with windows professional version,6,5
Huawei,53010BLA,5,One of the Best Laptops at it's Price,2018-09-09,"Pros:This computer (specifically the model you're looking at) blows me away in CPU and GPU performance at it's price. I am a student and yknow most kids love to play games and 3D a lot, and this computer does a great job. As a YouTuber, I can get up to 1080p60fps doing lightweight gaming like Minecraft and Roblox (low graphics settings, but I'm sure it can handle higher)! The i7 really kicks butt and the SSD boots up the computer super fast (<5 seconds). As for Adobe, it also works excellent handling Photoshop and Illustrator at a breeze.","Cons:The only real con I see is the battery life, it drains super fast (2 hours) if I do recording (1080p60s) and 3D gaming. If it's website and document usage, like for typing an essay, I can get up to 5-6 hours of usage time. At a full charge unplugged, it discharges (during sleep and off) around a percent per 5 hours but I don't usually leave it unplugged overnight.","Other Thoughts:This computer is probably in my opinion, one of the best cheap laptops out there. I wasn't even aware Huawei had Windows Laptops, as I've had Honor 8 and Mate 10 for a year (also great phones). If I could message Huawei, I'd say ""Excellent work! Keep up the convenience and speeds!""",5,3

Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,"Do Not Buy--- Defective Software, No Customer Service and Insult to Injury",2019-02-20,Pros:big screen,"Cons:Software issues on Touchpad makes a zoom feature impossible to correct.  Lenovo tech says ""no solution"" and Lenovo customer service says just change settings (um, yea, we got that, but the software isn't allowing it anymore)  geesh  Multiple complaints on the Lenovo website and Lenovo doesn't care","Other Thoughts:So....  I wrote a  review (below) to Lenovo after I was forced to return this due to Zoom driver issues (as did many other reviewers)  Their insulting response is below my review giving us a basic, elementary instruction (which obviously we tried multiple times before contacting Window and Lenovo Tech support)  Hey Lenovo, It's bad enough you wasted our time along with many others, but don't insult us further by giving us a lame reply.  Shame, shame.· 4 days agoIt's the little things that matter......like customer service and solutions to minor problems. We are returning this laptop today after only a week. There is a small problem, yet intolerable one, with the touch pad features. After two days, we were informed that it is not something that can be fixed. You cannot turn off the touchpad features that cause a zoom if the the touchpad is accessed in a certain way. I tried to find a solution to this on my own for hours. Windows did a remote session and was pretty confused as to why all of the touchpad options were missing. Windows support advised me to go to Lenovo support. Lenovo support not only did not support, they advised me to do something that would have caused more issues and then ended the chat before I could ask more questions. Next, my husband stepped in. He went through Lenovo support and finally, the truth was revealed. Due to a split between the software companies Elan and Synaptics, the annoying touchpad problem could not be corrected. I will note that my husband is the CIO of a college with over 10,000 students and also, on the Board of his state's Education CIOs. They network and they talk and the recommend. In short, Lenovo wasted many, many hours of our time and that just isn't right. A new driver should have been created for this product or Lenovo shouldn't continue to sell it... end of product line or not. As far as the rest of the details, it is lightweight with a big, bright screen, but I just can't trust the product and suspect other defects will be present. Defects in combination with the complete apathy to support means I had to replace this.Response from Lenovo:Courtnea_Lenovo  · Customer Care· 7 hours agoWelcome to our Ratings and Reviews section!Lenovo appreciates you taking the time to share your comments and concerns.

The one major flaw is the battery life of the unit.",1,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Adequate with a few quirks,2018-12-26,"Pros:Fairly thin, satisfactorily weight, screen is clear and bright.  Keyboard is easy to type on / no issues.  Touch pad is large which was one key purchasing factor for me.","Cons:Little disappointed with the touch pad - it has integrated / seamless buttons at the bottom of it.  If you're finger just rests on where the button lies you can't move the cursor (maybe an update can fix this?).  It's a tough habit to break having having real physical buttons.  I mean do you use your desktop mouse with your pointer (clicking) finger raised off the button the whole time?Unit is completely sealed - the battery is not serviceable / replaceable without taking the whole thing apart.  Essentially don't expect to upgrade anything with relative ease.Loaded with bloatware of course, junk software that you're only allowed to use as a trial then required to pay.Literally booted the machine up, ran thru Win10 setup, went to uninstall McAfee (see note above) and the system black screened on reboot and would NOT load Windows thereafter.  Had to restore from image after first reboot!  What the heck!?",Other Thoughts:I expected more performance considering a Gen 8 i5 and solid state drive.  I guess if I took this thing apart I'd find a no name china knock off SSD.  Yes its faster than a conventional drive but as far as solid state goes - its one of the slowest I've ever used.,4,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,Returned two glitchy laptops in two weeks,2018-12-20,"Pros:Fast start up, lovely design, very light weight, nice screen size.  Love the DVD/CD drive, most laptops don't even have those anymore.  Price was alright.","Cons:First laptop worked at first, but the shift key was stuck a lot. Not great because I type 100+ wpm and who needs a sticky keys window interrupting every few seconds.  Also the computer started to say ""plugged in, not charging"" a week after I purchased it.  I was told this is a rare bug, Lenovo said this is an economy mode setting, which I hadn't touched.  I returned the computer for a new one without a problem.The second computer had problems immediately when it was set up.  CPU ran anywhere from 35-70% with no programs running, it was all ""background tasks"" I couldn't kill.  The fan was so loud it started to gave me a headache and never stopped.  The fast access apps on the start menu, when deleted, came back as soon as the computer was restarted.  Any game apps that came pre-installed like Candy Crush or Minecraft had no way to delete them OR open them.  This one went back for a refund instead.","Other Thoughts:The price is okay, found better for cheaper elsewhere, and Newegg was good about the returns, but when they refunded me for the laptop, they had a 48$ ""price adjustment"" that they took off what they refunded me, and when I contacted them they said they had already sent me that part of the refund.  ...no, no they didn't, so I had to get on with customer support about that, and that was just irritating on top of the rest of the issues.The laptops had potential, but I dislike broken keys and being on with support 10 minutes after opening a box, and re-boxing to return an hour later.  Newegg was great until the 48$ wasn't returned.  Just waiting for that now.",10,0

Video is pretty decent, You could probably run most games (I haven't tried them all yet) on low, which is OK by me for a laptop in this range.  I know for a fact it will run Shadows of Mordor in between low - medium at a decent fps clip.  Runs Warframe great.   But I didn't buy it for gaming exclusively.tl'dr - great laptop so far!update:  It's still going great.",6,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,"Buggy, returned Two in two weeks.",2018-12-09,"Pros:I didn't have the laptops long enough to get a really good feel for them, unfortunately.  The first laptop I received was okay, but had some bugs in it.  Everything ran decently for about a week.  Fast start up, good graphics, fast downloads, everything a casual computer person needs to do the little things like play WoW and smaller games that don't require a lot.What I really, really liked about this laptop?  CD/DVD drive.  That was *AWESOME* because I have a lot of DVD's and I know laptops in the last few years have done away with them.Newegg was great about returning the laptops.  I first exchanged it for a new one thinking ""well one time isn't unheard of.""","Cons:Pointer's fastest speed was half of what others are.  First laptop had a shift key that wouldn't work right and after a week the battery said ""plugged in, not charging"" which I was told was a rare bug.  Lenovo told me it was an ecomony mode.. but I didn't have any of that set up.  I sent it back without hassle from Newegg, so that was very nice.  (Will need to figure out how to get warranty refunded since I only had the computers for a total of a week all together...)The second laptop, however, had a LOT of problems.  Touchpad issue again, which was annoying, but first time out of the box, the fan is running like I had the computer three years in a dusty room and never shut it off.  I checked my CPU and it was bouncing from 35-70% with one small program running!  So I look deeper and there are over 100 background ""tasks"" running that every time I end them, they pop right back up and resume eating my CPU, I can't find them to delete whatever is making them, and it's not like I installed anything except the basic programs on the laptop (Discord, Firefox at the time).After both of these problems, there are *many* apps in the start menu I could not delete, could not open, and could not do anything with.  Support was no help on this and just said ""We need to look further into this issue, we'll contact you.""  Things like Candy Crush and Minecraft that... honestly, if you're going to advertise for these, at least let people uninstall the shortcut or even open them to figure out what the heck they do, because clicking on them got me no where and right clicking on them only had the ""pin to start"" option.Which brings me to my final problem.  There's the cascading walls of ""fast access"" apps on the start menu, right?  I hate them.  I unpin them as fast as I can because it's ugly and obnoxious looking.  So tech support is helping me with another issue I'm having (really great to be on with tech support 10 minutes after unboxing a brand new laptop, by the way, because of a bunch of problems...) and they reboot my computer.  ALL the ""fast access"" apps are back in my start menu.  So I unpin them again, shut the computer down, and start it back up.  ALL BACK.  AGAIN.I'm not super tech savvy in the way that some people can build computers, but the CPU thing alone with the 100+ background tasks running was enough to send up major red flags.  I contacted several of my computer geek/tech friends and they all said the same thing: There is something majorly wrong with that laptop.So, the replacement laptop is going back too, for a refund this time.  Unfortunately, for someone like me, who wants a simple sturdy brick that'll last more than a year to play video games, watch movies, and have a few other programs running at the same time, this is not even an option to consider.",,4,8
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Great laptop for the price!,2018-11-24,Pros:-Performance is good for this thin of a laptop-SSD makes a big difference-Keyboard is really good for the price-Trackpad is acceptable-Build quality is great so far (had it for almost 3 months)-IO is good,"Cons:-Screen is a garbage TN panel, but no dead pixels or other issues-Battery lasts 4 hours, when in power saving mode just browsing the internet.",Other Thoughts:-Overall great product-If I was Lenovo I would have switched out the optical drive for a bigger battery-Would recommend for the price I paid ($500),2,2
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Very good Laptop. Great bang for the buck!,2018-11-08,"Pros:Good graphics(for the price), decently fast cpu, and good display!",Cons:No Cons! It was amazing.,Other Thoughts:When I first saw this laptop I was skeptical because of the reviews. But when I actually got to use it I found out that all those bad reviews were lies. This laptop is an amazing bang for the buck computer. I would definitely recommend!,5,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,1,Warning: Touchpad Issues,2018-10-30,Pros:Didn't get that far,"Cons:The only touchpad setting you can adjust is sensitivity. You cannot turn off ""tap to click"". This is per Lenovo tech support. If you dislike ""tap to click"", as I do, stay away from this laptop. Spent an hour updating drivers and bios before contacting tech support and learning it was futile. Simply cannot be done. No way, No how. This info should be in the product description.BTW, I'm an electrical engineer with 35 years experience in the computer industry and know what I'm doing.","Other Thoughts:Be aware that if you decide to return this laptop, despite it, in my opinion, being defective, you will have to pay a $75 restocking fee. And return shipping as well. Wanna talk to Newegg about it? Current phone hold time estimate is 75 minutes. Online chat is at max capability and not accepting chat requests. My respect for both Lenovo and Newegg has decreased considerably. Will be buying a laptop somewhere else.",14,23

Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,"Fast, Reasonably Priced, Reliable Brand (for me)",2018-09-27,"Pros:This is my third Lenovo laptop.  I bought this one because of the specs and price, but especially because of the reliability of the first two.The processor is very fast, coupled with the SSD and 8Gb of memory this machine runs very well.  The display is very good as well.The machine also has a wired LAN connector and a CD/DVD Drive which are getting less common on many laptops.","Cons:I've read reviews of this model where people complained about relatively low battery life, fan noise and the somewhat small SSD.  For my purposes, the battery life is not an issue as I seldom move it around for extended period of time.  I've had no fan issues either.  However, the SSD issue may be another matter.Knowing the size of the drive before I purchased the laptop, I thought that I would just store some lesser used programs and files on an SDHC card.  Upon inserting the card into the SDHC slot, I found it only goes half way in, leaving half the card exposed.  This would put the card in a precarious position which could affect performance and reliability of using it for working storage.  I had never seen a PC card slot that did not fully encompass the card.  There could not have been much savings involved in constructing the slot in this manner so I wonder why they did it.","Other Thoughts:I feel this is a well built machine, especially for the money.  While it has a few shortcomings, they aren't that significant for me and I would definitely recommend this machine.Also, for what I believe is the first time ever for a New Egg order, the package arrived 2 day earlier than scheduled.",7,2
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,"Good computer, some things could be improved",2018-09-19,"Pros:- Seems to working well so far. Everything is smooth, and I previously installed the Witcher 3 on this computer. It ran at almost 30 fps on low and 720p, and was smooth.- Keyboard is nice and quiet, and easy to type with. I like it.- display is 1080p which looks pretty nice in my opinion.- Cover and exterior looks pretty neat.- computer is pretty light- SSD runs very fast.","Cons:- Battery life. It can last the entire school day without dying, if I lock it or put it to sleep most of the time.- Battery life again. DO NOT USE BATTERY SAVER. IT MADE MY BATTERY GO DOWN 2 PERCENT IN A MINUTE.- It whirs audibly and I don't really have a problem with the sound, but some people may not like it.- When running simple applications like microsoft word and using bluetooth, battery goes down fairly quickly.- Space is too small. If it also came with a 500gb hard drive along with the 256gb SSD, it would be better in my opinion.","Other Thoughts:- I would recommend it, if you aren't looking for long battery life. It is pretty good for its price- I most likely would not buy it again, unless the battery was better.- If there was something about the product I would change, it would be the battery, and maybe the small amount of space. Most people don't need too much space but if you are into gaming or downloading movies, 256 GB isn't big enough.",6,2
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,3,Ok laptop.,2018-09-01,Pros:Boot up times are fast,Cons:Fan is extremely loud when performing simple tasks like searching the web or watching youtube.Display could be better.,,4,6
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Great bang for buck!,2018-08-31,"Pros:- Ryzen 2500U is a great CPU, 4c/8t and an awesome integrated GPU with Vega 8- Dual Channel DDR4 2400 RAM- Little bloatware (McAfee)- Solid build quality for price segment, the plastic looks metallic- Can game very well, beats the balls off Intel HD graphics- 256GB SSD in this price range is insane perf/$ for storage","Cons:- TN panel is meh quality, but that's really to be expected for price range- Don't even touch the Intel i5 options, you get similar CPU performance and terrible graphics performance","Other Thoughts:- When gaming, make sure you configure the Windows Power profile, reduce CPU to 50-75% max to give more power to Vega 8 so it can boost its clocks way high for 10-20% extra performance.",17,1
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Good Exp,2018-08-30,Pros:Fast and as expected,Cons:nothing so far,,1,5
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,4,Nice Machine for the Money,2018-07-28,"Pros:So just writing about the hardware, everything seems to work, which is of course expected, but it doesn't always happen. Its thin, about 4 1/2 lbs and gives a bright enough display, though for me at least, the display has to be set at 100% in a normally lit room. Speakers are on the tinny side, with little bass but certainly loud and clear enough. Start up is very quick (less than 10 sec) with the i5 cpu and the 256 Gb  Samsung SSD. And the machine is quiet. Having two USB 3.0 ports and one USB 3.1 c port is very good. One can purchase a USB 3.0 adapter at a small price if the USB 3.1 c port is not needed and one wants to have a third USB 3.0 port available.It took me a little time to get the hang of the touchpad to use the mouse consistently, but once I got some practice I found using the trackpad mouse has been fine. Using the keyboard on this machine is a highlight to me. Finger contact with the keys is easy but strong enough to give a nice feeling in use. Of the three laptops I've used in the last fifteen years this is my favorite, especially for using the keyboard.Taking a look at a couple YouTube videos of similar Lenovo models had me feeling confident that upgrading to a larger SSD in the future and cleaning the fan of dust build up would be relatively easy along with eventual battery replacement because of the straight forward disassembly of the bottom and easy access to those parts.","Cons:The wifi device on this Lenovo is 8.02.11 ac only.  Lenovo could have made this laptop more versatile had they used a dual band wifi device. In my own situation our router is broadcasting at 8.02.11 b g/n, so I use a small USB wifi adapter in the laptop that picks up that protocol to get around the issue.There is no hdd activity light on the computer.  To me, at least, I use that light as a key marker for the progress of activities and wish there were one as on previous laptops I've owned. That missing light is something I've always resented macs for not having.Although I have not run the battery all the way down at this point at one sitting it appears I can get a couple hours of use out of it at most before needing to recharge.","Other Thoughts:I bought a Lenovo laptop for my daughter about 7 years ago that still runs fine, though a bit slow for today's applications. Hopefully build quality is still as good if not better.",8,5
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Better than average laptop,2018-07-13,Pros:Lenovo brand name. Samsung SSD. Optical drive. 10-key. Runs quiet. Smooth. Virtually no bloatware!,"Cons:It does not look like you can replace the SSD without taking the entire bottom casing apart. One day I might try but for now, I'll have to manage with 256GB.","Other Thoughts:I removed the factory partition that was taking up 25GB of space. The display is OK...for the price it's acceptable. For about $100-150 more, I could've got a better screen.  Battery life is OK.",4,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Exactly what I expected,2018-07-04,Pros:- Good internals- Fast- Good keyboard- Decent screen (what is expected from a TN panel)- Rigid build (even if built with plastic),Cons:- Limited battery life,,4,0
Lenovo,81DE00L0US,5,Great laptop for what it was created to do.,2018-06-10,"Pros:This laptop performs excellently. the quad core processor combined with the SSD allow for quick load times on most applications. The casing itself is pretty solid. Even if it is not aluminum it seems sturdy enough with an appropriate amount of flexibility on the screen so that it isn't too susceptible to breaking. The tile style keys are well made, they have a very satisfying tactile response that is great for typing. The screen's brightness is really good, but it's not extremely reflective like a macbook, so there is far less of an issue with glaring. Having a disc drive and SD card slot are great for anyone who wants to watch media on the laptop separate from the internet Up to this point the power cable feels extremely secure in its port and takes effort to remove, which is a bonus if you're using it somewhere where it may be jostled around. On that same note, having an SSD instead of an HDD is great for preserving your data against damage from vibration. Having a laptop with a number pad is also very convenient for someone who needs to do calculations and input data. The speakers are about your average laptop quality, except for that they are able to surpass many that I have had experience with in terms of sheer volume.","Cons:The only downside that I feel isn't a result of getting the laptop cheaper than the more expensive options is the location of the track pad. While I do understand the idea of putting the track pad directly below the space bar instead of dead center, I often have issue left clicking when I'm not looking at the track pad because it takes a very conscious effort to reach that side of the trackpad.",,18,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,1,Customer service is horrible,2019-03-06,Pros:nice looking device,Cons:warranty options are non existent for repair,Other Thoughts:if you purchase a laptop from Huawei your only option for warranty service is to send it to their North American location in Texas.  You will be without your device for 7-10 days minimum.  They have no other service locations and there are no other options.  They will not send you a loaner device nor are there any partner service companies that can service your device.   Buyer beware!!!!!,1,1

I randomly remove it for flights and travel.Yesterday I open it to see a completely blank/black screen. The touch screen still works (when connected to HDMI via USB-C) but otherwise, its done. Booting to BIOS is black, POST screen is non existent, but the external display works.I've contacted Huawei in the long shot hopes of getting a fix, as this really was a fantastic machine.",3,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Fantastic Laptop for Graduate Student in Science,2018-11-24,"Pros:My review is a bit biased since this is the nicest laptop I've ever owned, but this thing is just incredible for its size and price.1) Processing speed is top-notch2) Display is crisp and very bright, which is perfect for typing or reading articles outside3) No tape over the web cam - I do not use the web camera often so this is not a problem for me as it is some people4) Ive had this laptop for 4 months and have had zero issues installing or running any software (including data analysis programs, which run very fast on this laptop)5) Decent internal storage but great speed for regularly backing-up data6) Super lightweight and durable; sleek profile7) Speakers are the best of any laptop I have used or heard8) Backlii keyboard and keyboard style make long days of typing easy9) Touch screen is great; I actually did not know this was a touch screen until after I bought it.... silly but was a pleasant surprise!10) Touchpad sensitivity is often said to be a Con, but I love how quickly I can move around the screen. I usually hook-up to multiple monitors, so it can become difficult transitioning and not using a mouse. This touchpad solves that issue","Cons:There are not many Cons for me1) Webcam angle is weird. although I dont use it often, it is a bit strange when needed2) Fan sometimes gets really loud when the computer is plugged in; not difficult to ignore though3) Wish there was an HDMI port in addition to the current USB-C and USB ports. I usually hook up to two additional screens but even with the USB-C converter sent with the laptop, this is not possible with mouse and keyboard unless the user has logitech unifying devices.Aside from these things, which really don't impact me very much, this laptop is downright amazing. Will buy Huawei again if they keep up this level of quality for price. Beats MacBooks by a mile considering the bang for you buck.",,0,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,3,"Almost, but not quite (yet)",2018-11-17,Pros:- Great screen- Great size- Great power,"Cons:- Still no option to leave backlit keyboard ON or to have it turn on when trackpad is used (it is also not the brightest)- Trackpad loose out of the box, resulting in rattling and requiring a hardware hack to try and address- Fan noise is very annoying (my XPS 13 was much quieter)","Other Thoughts:- Hoping Huawei spends the few hours to program, test and push a BIOS or software option to change the backlit keyboard settings",0,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,2,Very Good For About 3 months,2018-11-10,"Pros:Very nice battery live, Stylish and easy to handle on your hands. Screen is out of this world and Sound is just the best i ever listen to on a laptop.",Cons:Gave me the blue screen of death several times withing the first use.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop is just amazing on almost every aspects. I just have bad experience with the service. If Huawei wants to compete with Apple or Dell, they have to step up their customer services. I most to have a defective device front the beginning because i had several blue screens withing the first uses. I rebooted the PC and then it works every single time. After 3 months it did not came back on at all. The last blue crashed the PC did not recovered from it. I understand that  stuff happens some time with technology and electronic devices but when you paid $1,600 for a PC you deserved a better service. I called the Huawei and after spending 20 minutes with then over the phone they asked me to send the PC to them  so they can fix it and send it back to me. This is a work PC and I'm dead with out it. So now I have to wait Who knows for how long to get the PC back. This is just not right. If a device dyes withing the first 3 months they should just find a way to take care of the customers. Again I know that stuff happens but coming from Apple service to this is just depressing. Not a pleasant experience.",3,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,1,Dead after 3 months,2018-10-31,Pros:Was great while it lasted,"Cons:Won't boot at all after only three months. Very disappointing, worked fine one day, closed the lid...came back next day and power button does nothing.","Other Thoughts:I'll update my rating if it gets fixed, but my research so far has shown Huawei isn't great to work with. This machine may look great but have underlying issues that are starting to show, so buyer beware. No one wants to waste $1500.",4,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,4,"Laptop is good, problems getting Office 365 working",2018-10-17,Pros:Laptop and graphics look great and run very smoothly. Great value so far in terms of design and usability. Let's hope it stays that way for at least several years!,"Cons:-The ""1-Year free"" Office 365 Personal initially came deactivated. The version pre-installed on the laptop was only a 14-day trial, and it asked for payment for the full version. After some back and forth with Huawei, Newegg, and Microsoft, Microsoft agreed to provide a 1-year activation for the Office software, attached to a Microsoft user account.-Graphical interface for older apps is very messed up, sometimes unusable. Windows, icons, buttons, and installer menus on some old (pre-2011) and not-so-old apps are either teeny-tiny, or blurry and stretched, on the full 3000x2000 resolution display. This was true for Faststone image capture, Winamp, and a few other apps.-Text occasionally gets cut off on the right side of the page. Again, I believe it's an issue with the 3000x2000 display, which is a non-standard aspect ratio. While the display is very crisp and clear, Huawei really needs to update their graphics drivers to fix these problems.","Other Thoughts:-Just hope the manufacturer and seller are being honest in the product description, about whether the software is really free or just a trial version.",2,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,3,Good and bad in one device,2018-09-02,Pros:The battery life is great. Much better than my Lenovo Yoga X1 third gen. The wcreeen in very bright and sharp.,Cons:The keyboard is very shallow. Won’t let me type fast.  The plastic scratches easily. Very cheap plastic.,,2,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Good Laptop,2018-08-16,Pros:Its easy to use this laptop. I really like the..-back lit keyboard-speakers (they really do have great sound to them)-beautiful screen-ease of typing,"Cons:Gets pretty hot on the bottom when charging and using, the mouse pad can be a little over sensitive to certain touch (like it will select something I didn't intend it to at times)",Other Thoughts:This review is based on the fact that I recently bought this laptop and so I will continue to see how it goes with continual use,4,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,The MateBook X Pro is a VERY impressive laptop,2018-08-16,"Pros:The MateBook X Pro is a speedy, lightweight laptop with a gorgeous (touch) screen. I've been impressed from the very moment I removed it from the box. Fan noise hasn't been an issue at all. The fingerprint reader in the power button is stupid fast and very accurate - like this better than the Windows Hello camera on the Surface Pro. My unit came with the latest BIOS 1.12 and only had a handful of driver updates from Huawei to install. Highly recommend!","Cons:- Came with Windows 10 Home, but it's an easy upgrade to Pro for $99 - I did this primarily to enable Bitlocker drive encryption- The underside gets a bit warm at times but never hot or uncomfortable- Not to nitpick, but the power adapter plug is a strange arrangement and will block adjacent outlets on a power strip- It would be nice if there were an option to keep the backlight for the keyboard on","Other Thoughts:I've been using a Surface Pro for the last few years (Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4 and the 2017 Surface Pro - all with the keyboard cover as well as the Surface docking station setup). I recently tired the Surface Book 2 and found it to be a very nice machine but it was a bit heavy for daily travel and a little ""clunky"" for lack of a better word. I'd been eyeing the MateBook X Pro, but just wasn't sure without any experience with Huawei. Prior to purchasing the MateBook X Pro, I pored over reviews for at least two months - it was a toss up between this and the XPS 13 9370 (2018) model. Ultimately, I think Huawei has done a stellar job here and I'm certainly not missing out on anything by not going with the XPS.",7,2
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Matebook X Pro is the best,2018-08-14,"Pros:I have been using the Matebook X Pro for about a week now. There is nothing I don't like about the Matebook. Touchpad, screen, style, keyboard, touch screen, MX150, ports its all a A++","Cons:Many complain about the fan, but after 2 days and all windows updates, it is very quiet. Under power options, if you change the maximum CPU Processing power to 99%, you will not here the fan at all, than create an All performance power option if you want to be all out at 100%. I haven't found any cons yet.",Other Thoughts:What a price for such specs. I love it in every aspect and have been enjoying it since I received it out of the box. Huawei will take over the industry very shortly and Apple should be afraid.,2,1
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Amazing,2018-07-31,Pros:I love the matebook x pro. So far it’s preformed great and every feature is outstanding.-The four speakers are really clear and loud for watching videos and listening to music-The screen is crystal clear and really close to the edges.-It contains that Nvidia graphics card and still remains really light for carrying it anywhere.,Cons:I haven’t really noticed anything to complain about. The camera is an odd viewing angle but I never use the camera and would rather have the screen ratio.,,0,0
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Bought for Work,2018-07-28,"Pros:Really, most everything about this computer is a pro. Fast boot up times, great screen, perfect for work. I specifically wanted something that was NOT a 2 in 1, and this fit the bill. Great specs for the price. Not really any bloatware outside of the garbage that comes with Windows (not huawei’s fault there). Really I have no complaints. Feels quality, love the solid materials and the grey feeling finish.","Cons:I really don’t consider these cons personally, because they don’t matter to me but so people know:1. The camera placement is great for privacy if you don’t use your camera (I never do so I really like this), but the angle and camera quality aren’t great if you’re a heavy webcam user or do virtual meeting stuff. Fine in a pinch, but not for frequent use.2.

Huawei,53010CAJ,4,Great product! not perfect yet,2018-05-30,"Pros:I bought this laptop after two months of reasearch and here are my thoughts.First of all you need to know what you're looking for in a laptop. Do you want it for hard core gaming, a mobile workstation, or an all around laptop with great mobility? For each one of these categories the specs of the desired laptop will vary.Based on this, what I was looking for was an all around laptop which is modern, good looking, great build quality, great LCD quality for photo editing, good enough battery life for a day at work, good performance occasional coding and simulation (because I mostly use my PC for this), and  maybe occasional gaming,  and all these under 1800 CAD.Here are my pros and cons for this laptop based on what was importannt for me in a laptop:Pros:-Awesome design and build quality-Great LCD and color accuracy-Good enough battery life of about 9 hours on better battery mode-relatively light and thin-Above average performance (not the best among 8550u equiped laptops)-Great value for what you get! the best price among competitors","Cons:The fan is loud when plugged in and it can get annoying to some ppl. This can be fixed by using a lower performance power plan though. I hope a bios update fixes this issue. However, the same issue is also observed in the Dell XPS, lenovo X1 carbon and all other ultra books with high performance specs.","Other Thoughts:Altough not perfect, but I would defenitely recommend this product since it is one of the best laptops you can get for this price!",1,0

Huawei,53010CAJ,4,There is still a lot of work for improvement (3rd generation MateBook X),2018-05-28,Pros:+ 3:2 aspect ratio +  Gorilla Glass touchscreen + sRGB coverage 95% + no PWM (pulse-width modulation) + narrow bezels + Thunderbolt 3 + USB 3.0 Type-A (customers request) + high quality chassis,Cons:- lack of SD card - coil whine while AC adapter plugged in - slower '1D12' variant of the GeForce MX150 - loud fan when gaming - the poor webcam position - user unfriendly ssd upgrade (under heatpipe) - soldered RAM - no pen support,"Other Thoughts:one of the best features - 3:2 screen ratio with very narrow bezels. great idea. but for lots of photographers really need sd card slot. very mixed feelings about the product. this laptop would be the winner if the company decided to add an sd card slot and two internal SD slots to it (1st ssd - os, 2nd - user files, booting could be from 1st ssd or from 2nd ssd - choosing from BIOS) and also fix the cons above",3,4
Huawei,53010CAJ,5,Exactly what I was looking for,2018-05-20,Pros:- the 3:2 aspect ratio was key in my decision- touchscreen- lightweight with decent battery,Cons:- Can get quite hot but no worse then other ultrabooks i've used- webcam quality is low but I don't use it anyways- weird out of the box partitions,Other Thoughts:I do most of my work on a Desktop but on occasion need a laptop for travel. My x230t was not cutting it anymore and I was in the market for an ultrabook that was good for productivity. I ended up going with the Matebook X Pro mostly due to the 3:2 touch screen  and have not been disappointed with it since.  The only tip I have for people is  if you do reformat and re-partition make sure you install all the intel drivers from the site.  It took me a day to get the fingerprint reader to work again and it only did so installing Intel management engine drivers.,10,1

Hit F9 to optimize settings and F10 to save.This fixed it for me. The laptop works well.","Cons:All drivers were lost after Manufacturers BIOS update. You can't do anything aside from log into the computer.Edit: Overall I'm pleased with the functionality of the laptop but not the experience. I had to spend the first several hours of ownership troubleshooting issues. Even with most of them solved, the biggest Con for me is the fan. It cranks up often even when the CPU is lower than 20%.

Windows could not recognize the devices, and of course without networking no Internet to find some working driver.- Cannot find this product on Lenovo's website.

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away.

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight. It weighs less than the tablet/laptop it replaced.","Cons:-I don't have a complaint yet, but I'm not taxing it very hard, so your mileage may vary.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this for a mid-range laptop if you want it to work smoothly but don't want to spend crazy money on something like a Razer Blade.,1,0

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,Beautiful laptop!,2018-12-07,"Pros:Just to let everyone know, I have low standards for laptops. My previous laptop was 5 years old, was held together by duct tape, and overheated when plugged in. :) So really, any functioning laptop is good to me. I've only had this laptop for a few days, so here goes nothing with my first review!As for pros:-Beautiful, large display! I'm not savvy about colors and video quality, but 4k videos look beautiful on it, in my opinion-Sound quality is loud and crisp!-You can change the brightness level of the lights behind the keyboard, which is nice-Very lightweight laptop! It's really convenient to travel with it and it's so thin!-Fingerprint login is convenient and makes it easy to login-Very fast computer. It loads and opens programs and documents quickly-Long battery life! Up to 8 hours if you're just browsing the internet or watching YouTube videos-Loveeee the metal exterior. It's so sleek and aesthetic!-Keyboard works fine and it's easy to type with-As for gaming, I've only played Don't Starve and Monster Prom (yes don't judge me). The games run well and works fine to me.","Cons:Minor things:-The fan sounds annoyed me a lot. Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0

My screen randomly goes black and then comes back. Other times it goes black and I have to hard power down the entire laptop and then restart. Sometimes just after turning on my laptop and launching a web browser with a few tabs (nothing else running) it starts giving me memory errors and crashes Chrome. I have to restart the laptop and then everything is fine.Recently when the screen went black I got the blue windows screen and the error said ""Stop Code: INTERNAL_POWeR_ERROR"".

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Very poor LCD quality,2018-07-25,"Pros:- On paper, this laptop has decent processor , hard drive, and video card specs.","Cons:- However, the screen quality is absolutely terrible for an $800 pc. Do not get this pc if you are planning on doing any photo editing or movie viewing or graphic design. Despite numerous attempts to calibrate the color, I couldn't get it anywhere to a usable state.

I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Great computer, easy setup, very fast!",2018-07-24,"Pros:The computer is fast, and when I say fast, I really mean its fast! Boot up and turning off is instant. Everything opens super quick due to the SSD and the quad core i5 (8th Gen). The keyboard is perfect for typing especially having it be backlit helps. The design of the computer is nice, battery life is decent but could be better (what do you expect from a 3cell batt). The top of the computer when closed is not gold, its silver. Its a nice brushed aluminum silver. Fingerprint sensor is handy for signing in very quickly. Barely any bloatware!","Cons:No problems so far:The computer is a little ""plasticy.""

The plastic is very delicate so be careful with watches, etc. Took me a little bit to get used to the touch pad, its little off but after some mouse setting adjustments with sensitivity I was able to get it going well.Webcam is very basic, but I don't use it at all.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend it.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Surprisingly good,2018-07-17,"Pros:battery life: I only use my laptop at night, about 3 hours per day; on one Friday night I finally found that my laptop had been unplugged during the whole week. I watched youtube and did a little bit of coding, not so hardcore but some typical grad student work load. The battery life just surprised me.weight: a 15-inch laptop in my bag, easy peasyports: this one comes with hdmi port, sd card reader, and 3 usb ports; compared to other lightweight laptops this is impressive. no more stupid expensive adapters.heat: so far I've never felt it","Cons:speaker: it works, but not impressive",,3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Lemon Laptop Nightmare,2018-06-22,Pros:Seemed like a good laptop at first..,"Cons:Laptop was purchased 12Apr18 as a gift for my fiancee and it's now 22Jun18 and the laptop STILL has issues. 1st RMA, as soon as I got it back I fired it up and within minutes it locked up again(Please note that I had to PAY ship back a NEW RMA laptop). 2nd RMA after getting it back I didn't notice any intimidate issues.. then after running some stress test software, it both hard locked and the screen was stuck flickering which persisted even after a hard power cycle (even into the BIOS). It eventually went away.. now, here I am 2 months later with this NEW LEMON laptop and frustrated to no end and now working to RMA yet a 3rd time.  I'm at the point I want to trash this and be done with the whole thing. Longtime Asus mobo user since 90's, this is the LAST ASUS LAPTOP I WILL EVER PURCHASE.",Other Thoughts:This is actually an updated review. I had to delete the original review because there doesn't seem to be a way to update.,2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Im sure the product is great. everything seemed fine just sucks they cant send me a working version.,2018-06-20,Pros:the screen how it is supposed to come was great. great contrast and color accuracy. has a lot of the features of a much more expensive laptop but remains for the most part a good product. space is great laptop runs quite fast and I would totally be in love if not for the screen issues.,Cons:The problems are more with its shipping. I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Absurd Limited purchasing configuration options,2018-05-05,Pros:Fast machine,Cons:It makes no sense to get just maximum 256 GB M.2 ssd option. I wish I could avoid the Hard drive an the ssd to just get an 1TB ssd. The graphics card has only 2GB video memory an this is very limiting for today apps and games.,Other Thoughts:As it is being sold I could not recommend this product and I already have an Asus laptop,0,18

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good value + ability to upgrade,2018-04-21,"Pros:- Light and well built- Good display- Easy upgradability- Don't let the ""gold"" color turn you off -- t's a very subtle gold.","Cons:- Webcam is pretty poor- Not the best battery life? It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up. And another great experience buying from Newegg, of course.",6,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Excellent laptop!,2018-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful screen, nice keyboard, especially the dedicated Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys on the side, speedy 8th Gen CPU, decent battery life, light weight.","Cons:The Power button next to the Delete Key...  I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry. I have been using Dell laptops for many years, the last one was a Inspiron 7000.   I don't like the newer Dell keyboards.Well done Asus!!",8,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,The Best Purchase,2019-03-19,"Pros:-Beautiful screen-Long battery life (on battery saver at 100%, I can get 11 hours while I write on google docs)-Nice looking-Very fast-Can play video games very nicely (so far have played Stacking on highest settings and Sims)","Cons:-Others have said the keyboard is ""flimsy"", while I wouldn't use this word it def has some flexibility and I wish it was a bit more sturdy. That being said I can type very fast and accurately on it","Other Thoughts:I researched laptops for two weeks before buying this one on sale for about $780. I had not wanted to spend that much, but this laptop had it ALL. It was beautiful, it has an SSD so it boots wicked fast, it has a NVIDIA card so I can play games on it with ease, and the screen size and nano-edge display makes it feel like a full monitor screen. I have no regrets about buying it.",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,I would buy this again,2019-03-04,"Pros:-Setup is so brain dead anyone can do it-The keyboard is as good as a membrane will get, but for the price point I was very pleasantly surprised, responsive and enough travel for anyone to enjoy, even coming from a mechanical keyboard-Screen is quite good, blacks are deep and colors are vivid, content creation not recommended however-Speakers are quite good, loud and are good enough for laptop speakers, good for YouTube and content consumption","Cons:-The delete ""forward"" button is hidden right next to the power button, wish it was where the home button is-Track pad is something to be desired, the tracking is slow and a little slow to respond, but nothing to major, more of a gripe than a feature that's missing","Other Thoughts:Over all the speed is very, very good. The 8th gen processors are nothing to scoff at, even coming from my gaming desktop this has pleased me so far. The SSD helps a bunch with loading programs and such, though I will upgrade to 16 GB instead of the normal 8 GB. But I'm very pleased with my purchase and would do so again if need be, slim and sleek looking, bezels are almost non-existent if you don't focus on them, other wise they fade away. Great buy, if you were on the edge like me, pull the trigger!",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Very thin, super practical",2019-03-01,"Pros:The laptop is great overall for its price. I recommend it for personal use, not gaming at all. One of the features I mostly like is the finger print. It's really nice to have.",Cons:None at all,,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,Great bang for the buck,2019-02-27,"Pros:It is honestly a beautiful computer, it is very thing and the finish on the back looks really good.its powerful, for these specs I haven't really seen anything else at this price range.the screen is beautifulthe keyboard is greatso far not loud","Cons:the track pad is just plain bad, I've only had it for two days now, and about every 30 minutes it just glitches out for 2 seconds, it's pretty disappointing, but you get what you pay for. When it does work the size and placement are nice, but when it glitches it just does not respond to what you are trying to do.",,1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,"Super thin and light, yet powerful",2019-02-22,"Pros:Received this as an EggXpert review item -was expecting a different laptop but this is what showed up.   First time that has happened but I'm not complaining!8th Gen i7 opens and runs programs and browser windows super fast, and crushes cinebench.  Very thin and very light.  The finger print reader built into the touch pad works very well and can be programmed for multiple fingers.  The touch pad itself is very responsive and works as good as any Windoze laptop I have used.   The 512GB SSD is perfect for lots of programs and basic storage and 8GB of RAM is the sweet spot for most computing. but If you need more, there is an empty 2.5"" SATA drive bay as well as an empty RAM slot that will allow doubling the RAM.  Also, very easy to take the back off and get to the innards.  Backlit keyboard is very clear and works well with three levels of brightness and as well as off.  The screen is beautiful and easily viewable within about a 60-degree arc so it is easy to share content with others without being cheek to cheek.","Cons:Graphics are a little slow for games, and graphics benchmarks are pretty sad.  The keyboard is a little bit flexible compared to other laptops but it types well and has a good feel IMO.  The lack of a dedicated number pad is the only thing that keeps this from being a great work computer, and the overall layout of the keys is somewhat cramped.","Other Thoughts:Even though this laptop lags in gaming benchmarks it is more than powerful enough to push HD content all day long and streams and plays digital HD media without any hiccups at all.   I bought a lenovo gaming laptop (from Newegg) a few years ago that has an i5 and GTX 860m.  That computer weighs 3 times as much, runs way slower, and is about 1/2"" thicker and a good inch wider and taller.  The one way that laptop still beats this unit is in games, but this ASUS is far superior as a daily driver.  Also, the screen on the ASUS beats the TN screen that came with that supposed ""gaming"" lenovo.  I actually did the research and learned how to replace a laptop screen just so I could upgrade that laptop to an IPS panel...  It drove me nuts.  Not intentionally bashing lenovo, but for the same money four years later I would choose this over that all day long.   If you want to game, spend real money on a true gaming laptop from ASUS or MSI.They keyboard would have benefited from another row of keys to eliminate all of the FN presses but that would have jacked up the price and I am used to it after a couple of weeks already so I am very happy with that compromise.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,S510UN-NH77 - Great For What It Is Supposed To Be!,2019-02-11,"Pros:This laptop is thin, it is light, and it is powerful for being so thin and light.The screen is beautiful.  The bezel is very thin, and the IPS panel looks great.The i7-8550U processor is very powerful.  It also did not have thermal throttling issues like I've seen with other thin laptops using the 8550U processor, so the 8550U stayed at 4.0GHz even under sustained full load.  This would make this a great laptop for people looking to do things like video editing on the go.Including a dedicated GPU is a wonderful bonus.  Most laptops in this thin and light category only have the Intel integrated GPU, and that is very weak. Now, the MX150 included with this laptop is not a very powerful GPU, but it is a lot better than the Intel GPU.  And it is nice to have.  It will allow for casual gaming.  However, playing modern demanding games will require that the resolution be lowered and setting in the games to be set down to low.The battery life on this laptop is down right awesome!  I sat using this laptop for 3 hours straight, browsing the internet and watching youtube, and the battery went from 100% down to 60%! I had the keyboard backlight off, that is important because that backlight uses a lot of power, and the screen brightness was set to 25%.  That is actually very good, and I suspect the full battery would have lasted about 6 hours of use, not gaming, but casual office work type use.I have to really give ASUS point for the upgradability of this laptop.  Most thin and light laptops are not easily upgradable.  Most have soldered, non-upgradable RAM, and no space for a 2.5"" hard drive or SSD.  However, this ASUS Vivobook S not only has two SO-DIMM slots for RAM(one occupied by the single 8GB stick already), but it also has an open 2.5"" bay that you can use to add either a hard drive or another SSD(7mm max height).  Plus, accessing the RAM slots and 2.5"" bay is very easy, unlike some other laptops.  You just take the screws out of the bottom of the laptop and pop the bottom panel off.  And I do mean pop because it is held on pretty tightly by plastic clips that you have to literally pop them out to get the cover panel off.The trackpad on this laptop is very nice to use.  It is accurate, and has yet to miss a two finger scroll or gesture that I've made.  It is also very smooth, almost as good as an Apple trackpad.  I thought the little notch for the fingerprint reader would be an issue, but it hasn't been.","Cons:There are a few minor cons to this laptop, some of them were compromises that had to be made to allow other pros to exist.The first con is the lack of a number pad.  However, this had to be done to make the laptop smaller as well as allowing for the narrow bezel around the screen. There simply isn't space for a number pad on the keyboard.  And I think ASUS made the correct decision here.  This 15.6"" laptop is actually smaller width wise than my 14"" Ultrabook from a few years ago.There is no ethernet port on this laptop, and ASUS did not include a USB ethernet adapter with the laptop.  This point alone is why I took off one Egg from the score.  I understand that because of how thin this laptop is, having a built in ethernet adapter wouldn't likely have been possible.  However, I think ASUS really should have included a USB, preferably USB-C, ethernet adapter with the laptop.  I can buy one of these adapters for $12 from here on newegg. I can only imagine ASUS buying these adapters in bulk would bring their cost down to half of what I pay at retail.  Not including one with a $850 laptop just comes off as extremely cheap on ASUS's part to me.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely the S510UN-NH77 laptop to people.  I can see this laptop making a great laptop for a student.  The battery should last through the day when they are going to classes without needing to be recharged.  But at the same time, it will allow them to play games casually.And speaking of playing games, lets talk about the performance in games a little more.  The MX150 that this laptop has is almost identical to the desktop GT 1030 graphics card or the integrated Vega 11 graphics on the AMD 2400G.  That means modern demanding games are playable, but not at 1080p.  This is not a gaming laptop, but it is a work laptop that can also play games.  That is a big difference.",3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Not a problem!,2018-12-19,"Pros:I bought this as my new work laptop, so I'm not running games, video editing, or anything intensive on it, just browsers and image editing.-Compared to other comparable laptops, this one has good specs for its price, especially  since I got this on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday for about $100 off.-Runs smoothly, quickly, and quietly. I rarely have the fan even need to turn on and it finishes booting within a couple seconds.-The battery life seems to get me close to through a full day of work.-Incredibly lightweight. It weighs less than the tablet/laptop it replaced.","Cons:-I don't have a complaint yet, but I'm not taxing it very hard, so your mileage may vary.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend this for a mid-range laptop if you want it to work smoothly but don't want to spend crazy money on something like a Razer Blade.,1,0

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,Beautiful laptop!,2018-12-07,"Pros:Just to let everyone know, I have low standards for laptops. My previous laptop was 5 years old, was held together by duct tape, and overheated when plugged in. :) So really, any functioning laptop is good to me. I've only had this laptop for a few days, so here goes nothing with my first review!As for pros:-Beautiful, large display! I'm not savvy about colors and video quality, but 4k videos look beautiful on it, in my opinion-Sound quality is loud and crisp!-You can change the brightness level of the lights behind the keyboard, which is nice-Very lightweight laptop! It's really convenient to travel with it and it's so thin!-Fingerprint login is convenient and makes it easy to login-Very fast computer. It loads and opens programs and documents quickly-Long battery life! Up to 8 hours if you're just browsing the internet or watching YouTube videos-Loveeee the metal exterior. It's so sleek and aesthetic!-Keyboard works fine and it's easy to type with-As for gaming, I've only played Don't Starve and Monster Prom (yes don't judge me). The games run well and works fine to me.","Cons:Minor things:-The fan sounds annoyed me a lot. Sometimes when I'm just browsing the internet, the laptop makes quiet noises that sounds like a switch is being turned on, followed by quiet fan noises, and then repeat. This happens every once in a while, so it's not a big deal to me, but can get annoying if you're in a quiet room.-I wish the caps lock button had a light, but it's OK I guess :(-I think the wire for the charger is slightly shorter than I would prefer. Also, the plug is a giant block (similar to Macbook chargers), which makes it a bit inconvenient if you're sharing a power strip and don't want to hog outlet space","Other Thoughts:I am SO happy with my purchase and glad that I have a functioning laptop! I took off a star because the ""switch"" noise really irritated me for the first few days, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that priorities differ for everyone. :)",0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,"Great specs, terrible build quality",2018-12-06,Pros:- Great specs for the price,"Cons:- Its build quality is incredibly bad, the whole chassis has flex especially the keyboard deck (just typing normally bends the chassis)- Typing experience is terrible. The keys have an incredibly shallow travel distance and a mushy/spongy feeling.- Touch pad is not great but usable.- Small battery","Other Thoughts:Even though its specs are great and handles everything I've thrown at it the keyboard makes this laptop unusable. I can look past the cheap plastic frame but its keyboard is a huge deal breaker. My girlfriend has the F510UA which from what I can see uses the same chassis but her keyboard  has a decent springy responsive feedback to the keys with decent travel, which is the reason why I went ahead with the purchase. I was wrong to assume the keyboard would be somewhat similar to hers.I guess in order to offer these specs on a laptop at this price they had to cut corners somewhere, too bad it was in places that I consider integral to the user experience.If you plan to keep this machine on a desk and use it with an eternal keyboard, go for it. If not I recommend you give it a pass.",1,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,wonderful laptop,2018-11-05,"Pros:- packed into one size 15.6"" FHD footprint making this laptop ultra thin and smaller than most laptops with that size- excellent sound- video is pretty good, not perfect though- unusually light for a laptop of that size, the power adapter uses 25% less power than my older laptop- the fingerprint feature is cool- was worried that this thing is too heavy for a kid to take it to school, was debating if had to go with a 14"" size, well... this laptop happens to be lighter and as sleek as older versions of a 13"" Apple macbook.",Cons:- change the settings for the power button.  Initially it was set to power down the laptop if pressed.  Change that behavior to sleep mode- the power plug can fit in the wall socket and those who have limited space around that wall socket may need an extension cable. (make sure it's plugged into a a surge outlet rated for laptops/computers).Update to 11/1/2018:  Great laptop until it breaks in less than 8 months.  It's mostly a material thing that ASUS had to repair.  I freaked out when they gave the estimate.  The actual repair was less than the cost of the estimate.   I had to drop it to four stars because of the stability of the materials.  The laptop ran flawless so it's more of an open and close thing with the monitor attached to the laptop.,,0,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Good At First,2018-10-07,"Pros:Lightweight, good looking, fast.",Cons:Major power issue getting worse.,"Other Thoughts:This laptop has begun having some sort of issue which I believe may be related to power. My screen randomly goes black and then comes back. Other times it goes black and I have to hard power down the entire laptop and then restart. Sometimes just after turning on my laptop and launching a web browser with a few tabs (nothing else running) it starts giving me memory errors and crashes Chrome. I have to restart the laptop and then everything is fine.Recently when the screen went black I got the blue windows screen and the error said ""Stop Code: INTERNAL_POWeR_ERROR"".

ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Very poor LCD quality,2018-07-25,"Pros:- On paper, this laptop has decent processor , hard drive, and video card specs.","Cons:- However, the screen quality is absolutely terrible for an $800 pc. Do not get this pc if you are planning on doing any photo editing or movie viewing or graphic design. Despite numerous attempts to calibrate the color, I couldn't get it anywhere to a usable state. For example, I was looking at one image which I knew was orange but the monitor showed a dull brown color instead. The color accuracy on this is worse than my $400 HP laptop. I'm sending it back for a refund. I wonder if I received one with a defective screen?","Other Thoughts:Overall, if you do any sort of graphics work, do not get this one. If you're only using for word editing, this laptop will suffice, but so will many other laptops at half the price. So I'm not sure what value this laptop really has to offer.",3,2
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Great computer, easy setup, very fast!",2018-07-24,"Pros:The computer is fast, and when I say fast, I really mean its fast! Boot up and turning off is instant. Everything opens super quick due to the SSD and the quad core i5 (8th Gen). The keyboard is perfect for typing especially having it be backlit helps. The design of the computer is nice, battery life is decent but could be better (what do you expect from a 3cell batt). The top of the computer when closed is not gold, its silver. Its a nice brushed aluminum silver. Fingerprint sensor is handy for signing in very quickly. Barely any bloatware!","Cons:No problems so far:The computer is a little ""plasticy."" It's basically all plastic all around the computer except the top of it when closed. The plastic is very delicate so be careful with watches, etc. Took me a little bit to get used to the touch pad, its little off but after some mouse setting adjustments with sensitivity I was able to get it going well.Webcam is very basic, but I don't use it at all.",Other Thoughts:I would recommend it.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Surprisingly good,2018-07-17,"Pros:battery life: I only use my laptop at night, about 3 hours per day; on one Friday night I finally found that my laptop had been unplugged during the whole week. I watched youtube and did a little bit of coding, not so hardcore but some typical grad student work load. The battery life just surprised me.weight: a 15-inch laptop in my bag, easy peasyports: this one comes with hdmi port, sd card reader, and 3 usb ports; compared to other lightweight laptops this is impressive. no more stupid expensive adapters.heat: so far I've never felt it","Cons:speaker: it works, but not impressive",,3,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Lemon Laptop Nightmare,2018-06-22,Pros:Seemed like a good laptop at first..,"Cons:Laptop was purchased 12Apr18 as a gift for my fiancee and it's now 22Jun18 and the laptop STILL has issues. 1st RMA, as soon as I got it back I fired it up and within minutes it locked up again(Please note that I had to PAY ship back a NEW RMA laptop). 2nd RMA after getting it back I didn't notice any intimidate issues.. then after running some stress test software, it both hard locked and the screen was stuck flickering which persisted even after a hard power cycle (even into the BIOS). It eventually went away.. now, here I am 2 months later with this NEW LEMON laptop and frustrated to no end and now working to RMA yet a 3rd time.  I'm at the point I want to trash this and be done with the whole thing. Longtime Asus mobo user since 90's, this is the LAST ASUS LAPTOP I WILL EVER PURCHASE.",Other Thoughts:This is actually an updated review. I had to delete the original review because there doesn't seem to be a way to update.,2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Im sure the product is great. everything seemed fine just sucks they cant send me a working version.,2018-06-20,Pros:the screen how it is supposed to come was great. great contrast and color accuracy. has a lot of the features of a much more expensive laptop but remains for the most part a good product. space is great laptop runs quite fast and I would totally be in love if not for the screen issues.,Cons:The problems are more with its shipping. I have had to return this product twice now. the first time they sent me this laptop with a dead pixel. fine. ill return it. the second time the package is half opened and smashed around. like at least put it as fragile or something. If you are going to buy this laptop I wouldn't buy it on here. the safest bet seems to be to buy it at a local store. I would have kept my old one if I knew that they would send me a replacement with terrible light bleeding. makes watching anything an in a dark room extremely washed out. could even be clouding because of how poorly the item is packaged. and if I was just using it for word I would care but it really makes watching my shows and videos in a dark room or late at night look terrible.,Other Thoughts:I would buy this product locally but I'm going to see how many times it takes to get a model that's actually working. just because I'm curious.,2,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,2,Absurd Limited purchasing configuration options,2018-05-05,Pros:Fast machine,Cons:It makes no sense to get just maximum 256 GB M.2 ssd option. I wish I could avoid the Hard drive an the ssd to just get an 1TB ssd. The graphics card has only 2GB video memory an this is very limiting for today apps and games.,Other Thoughts:As it is being sold I could not recommend this product and I already have an Asus laptop,0,18
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good product for low price very impressive.,2018-04-25,Pros:good and came without having any damage.  brand new item.work windows10 right away and wifi no problem.,Cons:can not find any problem so far.  would perfer to have longer hours of battery if possible.,,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Good value + ability to upgrade,2018-04-21,"Pros:- Light and well built- Good display- Easy upgradability- Don't let the ""gold"" color turn you off -- t's a very subtle gold.","Cons:- Webcam is pretty poor- Not the best battery life? It's fine for my uses, and I haven't tested it thoroughly, but looks like I'm getting around 4-5 hours.","Other Thoughts:I wanted a 15"" laptop with 16gb RAM and all SSD (no hybrid disks) for software development. No need for gaming. This ASUS model was a good match. It comes with 8gb  RAM and a 256gb m.2 SSD, but has space free for both a RAM upgrade and an additional SATA disk.So I immediately added another 8gb stick (used the SAMSUNG M471A1K43CB1-CRC 8GB 1Rx8 PC4 2400T, as recommended by another reviewer here), and a Samsung 860 EVO 500gb SSD.Opening the case is pretty simple. There are youtube videos on it. Be aware that there are two hidden screws under the back glued on pads.I installed Linux Mint and everything seems to work well with it. I first booted into Windows and resized the existing partition to half the disk. Installed Linux on the other half. To get into the BIOS, hold F2 while it's booting.Very happy with how it ended up. And another great experience buying from Newegg, of course.",6,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Exactly what I need and more,2018-03-22,"Pros:I am not one to write reviews, but felt compelled to write one for this laptop. This is my third ASUS laptop, never having had an issue with the previous two other than regular aging (had each one for +5 years and both were still operational). Out of the box, this laptop has performed flawlessly. The set up was a breeze, not much of any bloatware, and the specs are perfect for me. I will be starting grad school soon and wanted a more portable/lightweight laptop with good enough specs and this has certainly exceeded that for me. I do not do any gaming or use any labor intensive software so I cannot speak in that regard.  I found the battery life to be around 6 hours with web browsing and streaming videos. The color of the laptop does not resemble a gold color as listed, more silver especially for the back of the screen. I love how fast the SSD is, having only dealt with HDD before. The screen resolution is excellent with no glare. It also appears to come with a year of accidental warranty coverage for the laptop, which really shows the level of customer service ASUS offers. All around an excellent laptop and I am happy to have chosen ASUS once again.",Cons:None.,,7,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Excellent laptop!,2018-03-14,"Pros:Beautiful screen, nice keyboard, especially the dedicated Home, PgUp, PgDn, and End keys on the side, speedy 8th Gen CPU, decent battery life, light weight.","Cons:The Power button next to the Delete Key...  I disabled the Power button in Windows Power Options, so accidentally hitting the Power button would not shutdown or put PC to sleep.   The Power button will still turn on the PC,  and holding the Power button will still force PC to reboot.","Other Thoughts:This Asus S510UA is a pleasant laptop to use and carry. I have been using Dell laptops for many years, the last one was a Inspiron 7000.   I don't like the newer Dell keyboards.Well done Asus!!",8,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,This hits the 'sweet spot',2018-02-19,"Pros:For me, this is the best combination of features in a loptop that isn't intended for gaming - 8th gen i5, 8GB RAM, and a SSD.  The price point is very competitive for this feature set.  I don't see an excessive amount of bloat-ware installed other than a 30 day trial of McAfee anti-virus.  The laptop is very slim and light, and I appreciate some niceties like the back-lit keyboard and fingerprint reader.The performance is very good out of the box, and as I said earlier, I don't see a lot of bloat-ware slowing it down.  The specs say RAM is expandable to 16GB, and I have not verified this yet, but do value that, as I have always found a RAM upgrade to be the first and best step in extending the useful life of a laptop.","Cons:You get what you pay for - it's not as powerful as an $800+ laptop with better processor, GPU and more RAM.  I think it's a good value for the money, though.The interior and bottom surface finish is kind of a gold or rose-gold color - this caught me a little off-guard, I was expecting silver.  The top of the lid/back-side of the screen is a brushed silver finish.","Other Thoughts:I've been very happy with this purchase overall - I had read some concerning reviews about the previous generations of this model line with shoddy keyboard and trackpad construction.  I'm happy to say that I am not experiencing any of those issues with this model.  Primarily, I use it to surf the web, watch streaming video, and run some basic desktop apps including VoIP, and it has performed very well in all those areas.",15,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,Didn't meet my expectations,2018-02-02,Pros:Upgradable ram and hard drive,"Cons:Very noisy fan, feels cheap all (plastics)","Other Thoughts:I originally bought Acer Swift 3 SF315-51G-51CE from Newegg and there was defect with speaker so I returned it and got this one. Comparing to swift 3, Vivobook has better spec like SSD+HDD, 8th gen i7. That is it nothing more. The swift 3 has much richer screen color and also has aluminum frame. Also, it is much quieter - no crazy fan noise. And swift3 was 300 dollars cheaper when I first bought it.",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,4,"Really nice laptop, except ...",2018-01-05,"Pros:Obviously nice and light; almost unbelievably so.Wicked fast (okay, understand that I'm coming off a ten-year-old Dell Intel Core Duo.  But still...)Bright, sharp, colorful screen.  Perhaps I don't have the perception to see the color range issue others have mentioned.Virtually no third-party bloatware to get rid of with the Signature Edition.  Time saver.","Cons:As others have mentioned, the power button is poorly located (near the delete key.)  I'm learning, but I still hit it occasionally.A cap-lock indicator would be a plus, but the lack thereof is not a deal killer.The key travel is a bit shallow and unremarkable -- but I have had no problems typing on the keyboard at speed.Here's the big hit, mentioned by others:  The trackpad is awful.  ""Juttery"" is a good word.  ""Randomly unresponsive"" is another.  The problem seems to be a combination of too-smooth trackpad with too-dry and too-smooth fingers (a trait, I assume, that will mitigate somewhat in sweaty summer weather!)  Moistening fingers (and wiping them off!) usually cures the juttery response -- for awhile.  But this should not be necessary.  Asus needs to fix the trackpad.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this product rather than others for specific reasons.  Besides the ordinary Web surfing, I do programming and run multiple database engines.  I need processor speed and RAM.  I do not game (the way most folks think of gaming today) or stream video -- but consider at least some level of discreet GPU a margin of safety.  I don't want a ""big"" machine but, though I looked hard at them, I couldn't convince myself to downsize to 14"" (the Lenovo Flex 5 is a really nice machine in a reasonable price range.)  Most 15.6"" laptops today come with numeric keypads, which I don't need, and which shift the trackpad to the left and leave the laptop wider than my old Dell by an inch or so.  Ergo that brought me back to the Asus S- series.This machine met my needs and was offered at an attractive price (about equal to the Lenovo offered elsewhere, but with a more current NVIDIA card and 8GB less RAM, which I can always upgrade.)  Even with the trackpad concerns, I don't (yet) regret the choice.",4,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Powerful for the price,2017-12-08,"Pros:This is almost more power than I know what to do with in a laptop! It's got everything and more I was looking for in the price range: Backlit keyboard, 15"" screen, lightweight, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM (though that may get an upgrade someday), and an 8th gen i7 processor! Most other laptops I was looking at in this range only had an i5, or an older i7. And none of them had a dedicated graphics card. It's fast and beautiful. The battery lasts a good while as long as you're not doing anything too extreme like gaming.","Cons:My ""U"" key has come off. I noticed it came loose on the second day of using it, and I've found that it pops off if I hit it just right (or just wrong, depending on how you look at it.) It pops right back on though. A bit of flex in the center of the body and some minutely imperfect seams suggest a slightly cheaper build quality, but it doesn't seem flimsy. Besides the key, I'm not afraid of it falling apart on me with normal use.","Other Thoughts:The other review may be right about the screen colors, but I haven't noticed it being a huge deal. I haven't done any design work like Illustrator or Photoshop on it yet, but I think I'd manage. If design/art/video is your thing though, you may be safer getting a better screen. Also, there is a webcam, it's just the most simple, low-quality, basic webcam on the market. I won't ever use it though, so no biggie. Also, the trackpad is great for a windows machine. I'm used to Mac trackpads, and usually windows ones are absolute garbage in comparison, but this one holds up.",1,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,1,Great specs for price but...,2017-12-07,"Pros:It is everything you would expect based on the specs (e.g., 8th gen i7, ssd + HD, etc),  but...","Cons:The track pad is the worst! It is jittery like all heck! I've truly never used a worse track pad in my life. In addition, a week into using the laptop the cpu fan started making terrible sounds like a bearing was broken.",Other Thoughts:Also note that there is no webcam. Such an easy thing to include! I returned the laptop and bought a better built laptop with lower specs and I am much happier.,0,1
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,3,WONDERFUL LAPTOP if you don't mind the screen,2017-12-02,"Pros:Incredible specs, backlit keyboard, small bezels",Cons:That silly 45% NTSC screen,"Other Thoughts:According to Newegg, 48% of people end up buying this laptop after viewing it. I wanted to share a few things before you're one of them. To start off, if you like the added portability of laptops with 14"" screens, you'll love the fact that, because of the thin bezels, the 15.6"" display is put into a smaller package! The downfall, however, is the 45% NTSC screen. If you do photography or any media editing, you'll quickly discover that the colors displayed by this screen are beyond inaccurate. Remember The Dress, and how people couldn't tell if it was white or blue? (old Internet meme, look it up). Well, I highly suspect it won't look like either to you if you use this screen!Intel has made a great leap with a quad core processor for conventional laptops. The specs on this baby are outstanding, just realize you're getting a not-so-great screen. And the speakers are on the bottom, but you should've known that by now!",2,0
ASUS,S510UN-NH77,5,Feature rich Thin and Light,2017-10-25,Pros:I search long and hard to find a balance of features to price and this is the closest thing i could find to my perfect laptop at a price that wouldn't destroy my wallet.  i'm still in shock that Intel finally woke up and has started moving along again and the quad core in a mainstream thin and light is proof.  Having 2 ram slots in a thin and light seems like such premium thing since so many others are soldering the ram on.  I know most can do fine for years on 8 gigs of ram but i've already maxed it out with one of my programs and i'm sure i will upgrade to 16 before too long.  The back lit keyboard is oh so nice and the screen is pretty nice quality.  I know this screen isn't as color accurate as some of the other screens i use but it's close enough for draft work.,"Cons:- Plastic casing around the keyboard is a bit springy and has a bit of movement, nothing crazy mind you.- The Thermal limit is very low on these 8th gen chips and with the just passable cooling on this laptop you will constantly be thermal throttling.  I just don't understand why they would thermal throttle this chip at 71C unless Intel is trying to keep it segmented away from it's HQ line.- The pictures on New Egg are not of this model.  They show a finger print reader and this laptop doesn't come with one.  I hate to put this as a con since it's not listed in the specs but someone should do their homework before posting the wrong model pictures.- Plastic chassis has a few imperfections that stick out although the seams on it are crazy good.(the few imperfections stick out bad since the chassis is just so good looking otherwise)",Other Thoughts:I would totally recommend this product to anyone looking to pick one of these up for productivity on the go.  Photoshop and Premier are great on this laptop and once i swap out the slow harddrive for another SSD then it will be even better.  This laptop is just so much power for such a small and light device.  Also for those worried about the battery life i can say it holds up very well.  For daily browsing and video watching i'm getting just above 6 hours.  When i start editing video that comes down quickly and i've only edited once so far on battery and in 2 hours i ate up just a bit more than half the battery.Gaming - I save this for last because i know people will want to know can it game and while you shouldn't buy this to game it does have chops to hang in old and new games.  You will have to make sacrifices on resolution and quality to play most games though.  I feel that if the laptop had dual pipes and fans then it could keep up and not thermal limit on such a low limit imposed by intel.,10,0
ASUS,UX533FD-NS76,1,,2019-03-20,"Pros:Other then the good look, this laptop is nothing.","Cons:This computer is a piece of garbage and ASUS warranty on it is a joke.

I am very surprised on it's performance compared to what laptops used to be compared to computers.I mean, I can actually game on it, no issues at all, and at good setting, SSD is very fast, CPU is not quite up there with my home rig with it's i7-7700K OC'd to 4.9 GHz or it's dual OC'd video cards........ But       IT     WILL    GAME         and do so fairly well.I ran this thing through every Torture test I know, even OCCT PSU for 24 hours, and it never blinked an eye. Heck I even had to reinstall windows because of the testing I did HAHA.All in all I find this Laptop acceptable in every aspect, as a Primary Gaming Computer it's not quite up to my standards, but I am an extremist I suppose.

ASUS,UX533FD-NS76,5,Great Work Laptop with Decent Gaming Capabilities,2019-01-26,"Pros:This is a medium-large, very thin laptop with a very bright, clear 1920*1080 IPS display, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB NVMe PCIe SSD, Core i7-8565U CPU, and nVidia GTX 1050 Max-Q GPU.The screen and keyboard are the best I've seen on a laptop--the bezel on the screen is very thin, looks like maybe 1/4 inch, and the keyboard has a real numeric keypad on the right side, which is wonderful for typists.For work, productivity, web browsing, and pretty much all routine tasks, this laptop is blazing fast.You can play games on it, but it's not a gaming laptop and its GPU is not the equal of its CPU or SSD.  I tested with the 2016 reboot of DOOM. On OpenGL using all Ultra settings, the game is not really playable, with framerates dropping as low as 15 fps.  All High settings raises that to 25-30, but only on Medium does the game become fluid enough to play well, with framerates in the 45-60 range. Switching to Vulkan only works for the High and below presets, as the 2 GB video RAM isn't enough for Ultra quality.  On both High and Medium quality, framerates are basically the same as with OpenGL.  Note that again, because of the 2 GB video RAM, when using Vulkan,  you have to exit the game and run it again every time you change the quality setting in Vulkan mode.The audio quality on this laptop is good.  with decent volume.  The sound is clear.  At high volume, treble response overwhelms vocal and bass range; the balance is much improved, though still of course weak on the bass side, if you pull the volume down to 50% - 75%.Battery life is very good for a laptop this thin, looks like for browsing and productivity you could have six hours or more.  Do a lot of gaming and that number comes down considerably, my testing indicates three to four hours with heavy gaming.  Still, not bad, as this is almost triple the battery life that my work-provided laptop offers.The display quality is amazing, bright and clear and without much dimming or color shift when viewed from an angle.  There are no stuck or dead pixels on the laptop display.Connectivity is good, with a MicroSD card reader, a SUB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C / DisplayPort combo port, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (USB 2 compatible), and an HDMI port, giving you two options for connecting external video.  Power and charge indicator lights are available on the right side beside the card reader.  The external power connector is also on the right side panel at the very rear.","Cons:A drive activity light would be nice--certainly not a deal-breaker.  There really aren't many other complaints I would have, except for not being a great fan of Windows 10.  I wish Microsoft would stop patterning their OS after their (now defunct) phone design, and design a GUI for a desktop operating system again.The ""case"" deserves mention. The laptop comes with a kind of slip-case cover, almost like a very thin black pillowcase, that secures with velcro.  This isn't my favorite sort of case, and has no handles or carrying straps.  Be careful when putting the laptop in the case that your grip on the laptop doesn't slip.  I recommend replacing the case with a real laptop case.","Other Thoughts:This laptop has high-end features that are appropriate for its price point.  I do wish it had a stronger GPU with more video RAM, but I doubt many people would consider buying this if they are looking primarily for a gaming laptop.This is a powerful laptop packed with the latest technology, and using it is a real pleasure.",3,0
ASUS,UX533FD-NS76,5,Sleek and Spunky,2018-12-12,"Pros:The 8565u was the main feature that sold me, boosting to 4.6, making short work of any applications.  The screen continuing all the way to the hinge gives it a sleek look making it appear as if there is no bezel on the bottom of the screen. No complaints on 16 GB of ram and 512gb SSD, should be plenty.","Cons:No major issues so far only one minor issue that the bugs me, the chassis. I am coming from an XPS 13 and the chassis on it was solid. The aluminum clam-shell design of the XPS is far superior to the plastic chassis of the Zenbook. Whenever I close my labtop and grab it to put it away, feeling the lid of my labtop flex just bugs the hell out of me.","Other Thoughts:I was torn between this or a new XPS. I was leaning towards the XPS 13 because I was familiar with them and didn't have issues before,  but the value of the Zenbook was too much to pass.

I was getting 400+MBs through the USB-C ports using a C-A converter to a Corsair GTX 256GB flash drive.  The screen it excellent and bright.  I'm also surprised how cool this seems to stay.",Cons:Not a con but this would have been perfect if it could have had a touchscreen.  I looked for one but there was nothing with the USB3gen2 ports in the system.  I did find a 4K screen version with a touchscreen but she did want a 4K screen and didn't need the MX100 graphics included.,Other Thoughts:All her co-workers loved it.I had zero issue transferring and installing all her apps in this computer.,1,0
ASUS,UX433FA-DH74,4,Great performance and battery in small package with some annoyances,2019-02-03,Pros:- Light and compact (more compacted but slightly thicker than my ux31a zenbook)- Fast due to cpu and nvme ssd- 512GB nvme ssd (Intel ssd 1800 read/1500 write)- Battery performance is good. i can easily get 6hours of decent web browsing activity on YouTube and other tasks.- Solid build quality (doesnt feel it will break)- comes with the USB3.0 GB LAN adapter- ac wifi.,"Cons:- Trackpad is annoying to use!!!! compared to my ux31a and other laptops ive used, this trackpad is a total miss. there are time cursor would just jump in random directions while trying to click on something... so unacceptable. You better use a mouse with this laptop otherwise you will want to return it if this isnt the case.- coil whine or some electrical noise is coming from the left area of the laptop when doing some cpu intensive tasks... annoying (review on other site about this issue states his stopped doing this after 2months of use... hope that is true)- no thunderbolt 3 port ..- Not a touch screen given it is a glossy screen... i would have liked touch screen given this point- the laptop sleeve case uses velcro instead of a magnet. i prefer the magnet like my ux31a has on its sleeve.","Other Thoughts:- Not a Matte screen given it isnt even a touch screen....- the blue color is nice but it is a fingerprint magnet... my ux31a was silver so you could hardly tell any finger prints were on there.- something is odd with the screen. if you go from a dark screen (youtube in dark mode) and then move to a bright one (open windows explorer for example) the image on the while looks a little blurry or grey like...it eventually gets normal bur during that time you notice the screen brightness step-up every second. strange.- the power adapter should of had the plug prongs fold into itself... this one just does not have that ability, shame. i have to say though that it is smaller in size than my ux31a, but that one does have the prongs fold in, guess that is the trade off. oh well.- wish there were more color options, i would have preferred a black option other than the blue.- when i am connected to 2.4GHz wifi i tend to lose connectivity randomly. i have to disconnect and reconnect to get connectivity back. i could be the only one, but anyway to workaround this issue i just use ac (5GHz) wifi..N.B. if you need to update the bios, use the USB2.0 port on the right side of laptop, otherwise it will not be detected by Asus ez flash utility in the bios.",4,0
ASUS,UX433FA-DH74,5,Great machine ...,2019-01-14,Pros:- small- light weight- fast- I can game with it ...

ASUS,UX433FA-DH74,5,"Thin, light, powerful laptop",2018-12-30,"Pros:This is an awesome laptop.  I knew it was thin and lightweight, but I was still surprised at just how thin it is.  The screen is superb, and I like that it is glassy as I am not fond of dull looking matte screens like my old laptop had.  The best part is the performance.  I was initially concerned about the low power Intel i7 1.8 GHz 4 core 8 thread processor because my 5.5-year-old ASUS laptop had an i7-3632QM 2.2 GHz 4 core 8 thread processor.  Because this newer 8th generation i7 CPU can crank out to 4.6 GHz on a single core when you need that extra power, it totally leaves my old laptop’s CPU (which I was pleased with) in the dust!  The wireless card is super great as well.  It stays connected to my AC1900 802.11ac router at the maximum speed of 866.7 Mbps and never fluctuates.  When I run a speed test of my 400 Mbps Internet connection I always get 400 Mbps or more download rate.","Cons:I must say the only thing I was missing from my perfect laptop wish list was that it comes with Windows 10 Home rather than Windows 10 Pro.  The laptop was not loaded down with bloatware and did not have a 10 GB or so recovery partition, so I resolved this issue quite quickly.  In Windows 10, I went to Settings > Update and Security > Activation and took the “upgrade your edition of Windows” option.   I clicked on the “go to the store” link, logged onto the Microsoft Store, put $100 on my credit card, clicked the install button, waited less than 5 minutes for a few files to load, and then rebooted into Windows 10 Pro.  I think $100 is a little pricey to likely “unlock” Pro features that already exist on the OS image, but it was extremely quick and cheaper than spending about $140 to purchase Windows 10 Pro OEM software or $200 for the Windows 10 Pro full version.","Other Thoughts:I would have liked two USB 3.1 type A ports instead of just one, but that is not a show stopper as I can connect a USB 3 hub if I need extra ports.  The USB type C port is USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) which is a plus as most of the laptops I have looked at only have a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) type C port.   I am not bothered by the slower USB 2.0 port on the right side because I like to use a wireless mouse, so I leave the receiver for that plugged in there.   I spent many hours searching for the perfect 14” laptop and this one truly fits the bill for me.  I would recommend this laptop to (non-gamer) power users like myself.",4,0

ASUS,UX333FA-DH51,5,Finally a true XPS13 competitor!,2018-12-05,"Pros:I just got mine in hand today and the build quality is just rock solid. This new generation is legitimately nice to hold and it's just so incredibly thin and small without any flex. Unlike a lot of the machines in this class it managed to keep a couple USB3.0 ports, so you aren't forced to carry around a USB-C hub. Similarly, it still has a full sized HDMI port as well. Subjectively speaking, the screen is very nice as well, quite bright and the colors look great. Keyboard is good, not too mushy.Biggest pro? PRICE. This is easily as nice (or more so) as the current gen XPS13, with more useful ports, but does it costing something like $300-400 less for a comparable configuration.","Cons:As for what not to like, most of it will be the same as all 13.3 sized devices. It's not the fastest CPU out there, no dedicated GPU for gaming. Neither of which I especially expect on a device this size. A larger SSD option without such a price hike would have been a nice option, but again, that's a similar pricing scheme to similar devices.Also, a full SD card slot would have been preferred over a micro. If someone needs a dedicated SD card port at all, it's probably going to be to offload a full sized card for DSLR cameras. Not a deal breaker though, just going to switch to using micro cards with an adapter in the camera.",Other Thoughts:This is just an excellent all-rounder non-gaming machine with all the portability you could possibly ask for.,5,2
ASUS,F505ZA-DH51,5,a hard drive can be added,2019-02-23,"Pros:A hard drive can be added easily, I added a 2.5” SSD SATA drive. You just have to remove the screws at the bottom and lift the upper (keyboard) case.I have seen similar models and I think there’s an additional memory slot, but you have to remove the motherboard to access it.","Cons:Initially I didn’t like the color (champagne gold), but other people seems to like it.",,2,0

Which i find to be very unfortunate as if this was a true M.2 PCI SSD then this laptop would be perfect for what you get.,9,20

I was not aware that ""solid state hybrid drives"" are a thing. (qv Thinkpad T400). My eyes scanned that too quickly. While somewhere in the back of my brain I knew a 1 TB SSD in a package that totalled $400 was too good to be true, I pulled the trigger anyway. That being said, the hybrid tech works as expected - boot times are MUCH faster. I'm using typical business software (Chrome, Office, GIMP) so actually this is a good fit for me. But if someone was looking for a bargain gaming laptop, this ain't it.","Other Thoughts:Yes, I would recommend this to business users.",6,0

ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,"LightWeight, Portable, Fast",2018-12-23,"Pros:Out of the box this laptop felt lightweight and well built. While being small and portable is was very fast and capable for most tasks including some light gaming. While being small and portable the screen features full HD resolution (1920x1080) and the picture is decent. Battery life was 1.5 -  8 hours in my usage cases, depending on if I was watching videos, playing a game (yes it has nVidia graphics so it can run some games), browsing the web, or working on documents. The backlit keyboard is also a welcome addition. When under load the laptop was not too noisy and didn't seem to get all too hot ( though it did get rather warm under continuous loads).  Windows 10 was not too much of a hassle to get setup and running, and the laptop itself didn't seem to be too loaded down with unwanted software or extras. The speakers also sound decent for their size. The SSD is decent speed wise (sata speeds) and just adds to how well the unit runs overall. It came with a small assortment of accessories, such as a USB to LAN dongle, an HDMI dongle, and a storage sleeve. The fingerprint scanner is nice when it works (see cons).","Cons:I don't have too many complaints about this laptop, however I will list a few things. To start with I don't like having to use dongles since they are sometimes an easy thing to lose. The next would have to be that McAfee came pre-installed on the machine, granted this is a personal preference, I removed it as it has caused me trouble in the past. After that the only other issue I had with software was that after Windows updated, the fingerprint scanner is not always responsive so I found myself typing the password in if I locked the machine, or if it went to sleep, on a fresh reboot it works every time. Noise wise I did notice a very tiny amount of hissing or what people call coil whine if I was close to the laptop when it was under a heavy load (in my case watching a movie laying on my couch). And finally my last nit-pick would be that the top being so glossy and snazzy as it is, it is a total fingerprint magnet and needs wiped down quite a bit. I don't feel it deserves to lose an egg since some of this is personal preference and different usages cases would yield different results.","Other Thoughts:I used this laptop now for about 4 weeks, it has been stable and fast. It's very portable and light. And while it's not a gaming machine, it was able to play some games and handled multimedia, like Youtube, very well. It would be nice if the memory was upgradable, and I could ask for some more ports, but these are the sacrifices made to have an ultra-portable computer. I cannot fault it since it runs fast and is very stable for how much power they have packed into such a small and lightweight machine. I could easily recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a portable, yet high powered laptop, having an i7 and an SSD just make working on it nice and quick with very few if any hiccups. Lastly I will say that it can play games, and will get warm and throttle when doing so, however it's not sold as a gaming laptop, so I have no real complaints with it. It has been a joy to use during all of my testing.Did a little bench-marking as well, results as follows:Geekbench 4 reported the following:Single Core Score: 4755Multi-Core Score: 14372OpenCL Score: 46497Crystal Disk Mark 6.0.2 (with a 4GiB test file) reported the following:Seq Q32T1 Read 556.3 MB/s  Write 454.9 MB/s4KiB Q8T8  Read 396.3 MB/s  Write 280.7 MB/s4KiBQ32T1 Read 196.5 MB/s  Write 201.1 MB/s4KiB Q1T1  Read 25.39 MB/s  Write 47.71 MB/s",3,0

One time I woke up to find that while the computer was sleeping and charging, it had a Windows crash (blue screen error) and it was way too hot to touch and fanning like a leaf-blower which had me concerned that it could have started a fire.","Other Thoughts:Basically, it's a great computer but has these annoying issues which should not happen at this price point, period.

ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,Powerful performance at a good price and great form factor,2018-11-16,"Pros:Out of the box the computer was not charged at all so make sure to plug it in when you get it.Once I charged it and got it up and running it was the standard windows 10 setup which was painless.The first thing that I did was install chrome and download steam.I tested the computer out by playing civilization VIIt handled the task wonderfully, I had no problem with the quality or the frame-rate even as I progressed through the game and the world became more complicated. While it's not the same quality as my desktop I don't expect that out of this form factor.The size of the laptop is also wonderfully laid out. The screen has a minimal bezel which allows for more screen space with the smaller form factor.Overall this laptop does not let down in terms of performance, the video card paired with the nvidia graphics provide performance in a small form factor along with providing decent battery life on top of that too.",Cons:Your standard issues for any pre installed windows os by including random bloatware. Mcafee is installed and that in itself is more of a virus than antivirus platform in my opinion.One of the other cons is that the top of the laptop is a massive finger print magnet. It is impressive how well fingerprints show up on it. For some that might be really annoying but I couldn't justify taking off any eggs for that.,Other Thoughts:Overall this is a solid offering from Asus. I remember when the first ZenBook came out and I really wanted one. I never had the opportunity to buy one but after reviewing this one I regret not making that more of a priority instead of using arguably mediocre laptops in the meantime.I think this is a solid offering for the price point and the performance. The only thing that I would have liked to see improved is the size of the SSD.,3,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,5,Great looking featherweight laptop for light to medium workloads,2018-11-15,"Pros:Gorgeous metallic blue finish.Incredibly light, yet very sturdy.Fast and responsiveThere is a USB port on both sides, although only the one on the left is USB3.  There is a USB-C port on left side.Wired Ethernet (via an included adapter) and a wired monitor (micro HDMI, or use the included adapter to convert to standard HDMI) are supported.  There is also an SD card reader, although it is only half as fast as when the same SD card was tested in my desktop.The built-in speakers are surprisingly good, as is the built-in camera.  I really like that there is a small light next to the camera lens that indicates when the camera is in use.I love the fact that there are no air intake vents on the bottom of this laptop since those are so easy to block.  I also love that the hot air exhaust is in the back, aiming up, rather than on the side, cooking my hand as I use a mouse.  The cooling fan (or fans) are dead quite, but I would have preferred better cooling even at the expense of a little of that silence.Goes into and comes out of sleep mode instantly.  So quickly, in fact, I wonder if it is really going completely to sleep.  Like the light in your refrigerator, the screen is on and you're ready to go by the time it is open enough to see it.It comes with a nice carrying pouch, but it is not padded and has no room for the power pack or any of the included adapters.  It will prevent the finish from being scratched when you put it in a backpack, though.","Cons:I hate that Asus and others create special versions of their products for each retailer like this Newegg Exclusive.  It makes it very difficult to compare prices and features, and even harder to find the actual specs.  For example, can the memory be upgraded on this?  You'll never know unless you can figure out how to get it open.  From what I can tell, in addition to the 9 tiny screws on the bottom, you also have to get the rubber feet off the bottom to expose more screws.  Those feet are so well secured, I was afraid I would damage the computer or injure myself so I gave up.  Online comments indicate that the memory cannot be upgraded, but that the M.2 SSD can, although you're back to getting the back cover off.  I wonder if the battery is replaceable?The cooling is seriously insufficient unless you're only going to be doing light-duty work.  Why put an i7 in there if it cooks itself when you actually use it?  After only 10-15 minutes of playing a game that kept the CPU at around 45%, with the laptop on a table, the CPU temperature was in the mid to high 70's (170F), and the bottom of the laptop was almost too hot to touch.  Even the table under the laptop was hot to the touch.  Because the bottom gets so hot, there is no way you could ever use this for any amount of time on your lap.I really don't like the placement of the power button.  It is in the upper right corner of the keyboard, right above the backspace key and right next to the delete key.  Fortunately, since the computer is so fast, it comes right back on after you accidentally hit it, again and again.  You can disable this button in the additional settings section of the power options control panel if you want to.I was  disappointed to find out that this particular version of the ZenBook14 doesn't have the illuminated touch-pad numeric keypad that is all the talk on the ASUS web page.This laptop has quite a large wall-wart power pack, that while rated for 100-240V (50-60Hz), it has a NEMA 1-15 plug that is only suitable for US outlets.  Every other laptop I have ever used has a short region specific cord that goes between the power brick and the outlet, making it more flexible.There is a lot of pre-installed junk on this laptop.  From games like Candy Crush and Mind Craft to trial versions of the entire Microsoft Office suite, there is a lot of wasted disk space here.  It's all easy enough to uninstall though.","Other Thoughts:A PassMark performance test easily shot the CPU temperature to 93C (200F) and drove the GPU temperature to 74C (166F), despite providing only 25 fps in the 3D tests.  At the end of the several minute test, the left side of the keyboard was 42C (108F), and the bottom was 38C (100F).  PassMark gave this laptop (while plugged in) a rating of 3838 and put it in the 78th percentile.  I was surprised by how poorly the memory tested (57th percentile) until I did some research and found it appears to only have DDR3 memory, which seems strange for a gen 8 processor.If you are mostly looking for a light to medium duty, featherweight laptop for surfing the web, watching videos, or using Office-like apps, then this laptop will work great for you.  It will handle heavier work loads for short periods, but I would be afraid of it overheating if used hard for a long time.",8,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,4,Lightweight Premium Build Quality!,2018-11-07,"Pros:Powerful lightweight notebook that is great for everyday use, light/medium video/photo editing, playing/streaming multi-media and even some light/medium gaming!NO bloatware installed, only Asus utilities.Nice 1.4mm travel distance on the keyboard keys.Touch-pad works great and is very responsive, no lag!Amazing matte finish screen completely reduces any glare!Wide viewing angle is perfect when screen sharing with others!Down-firing Harmon/Kardon speakers produce crystal clear sound, and there is no distortion when the volume is turned up.SanDisk X600 series SSD, 256G, M.2 2280 with a sequential read/write of 550/525 is right on with a few Crystal Disk tests I ran, which showed 555 read and around 510 write consistently.No fan ports on bottom or sides. The cooling port is nicely tucked away in the hinge area of the notebook, wherever you are using it there is no need to worry about blocking a ventilation port.Long battery life! I ran this all day alternating between some light gaming, browsing, and streaming videos for a few hours and still had power left to burn. At around 4% the computer will shut down, and it only took about 2 hours to fully charge it to 100% again.The top cover is an eye catching piece of artwork. While it is a fingerprint catcher, you could always find a custom full cover decal to protect it, or try a large generic clear screen protector which may help with fingerprints.Ram cannot be changed out or upgraded; the M.2 SSD can be changed to a larger capacity if you need more space.I have not experienced coil whines, or loud fan issues on the notebook that I tested, even after hours of using it.",Cons:The fingerprint scanner does not work 100% of the time. Not sure if this is a Windows problem or the scanner pad.,"Other Thoughts:If you want to try squeaking more out of the GPU try using Asus GPU Tweak II. It offers one-click custom overclocking with detailed information about the GPU. It can be found on their website.Current Bios version is 305 released 8/16/2018. On their support site, this bios show’s up under the UX430UNR model and not under the UX430UN model.If you want more storage and memory check out the ZenBook UX430UA which has twice as much storage and memory but will cost a lot more!LPDDR3 memory is soldered to the board so the laptop can be made thinner and lighter which allows more space for the largest possible battery. And with lower power consumption it creates less heat while helping extend battery life.Pay attention when using USB-C, as it can also fit into the mini HDMI port!Make sure you pull down all the updates right out of the box before you start using this notebook!!",3,0
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,4,Very capable Ultrabook that can keep up with the best.,2018-11-01,"Pros:This particular Asus UX430UN has two ideal uses when everything is taken into consideration. 1. Home multimedia (movies, music) & graphical use (photography). 2. Business use with ultimate portability and increased durability requirement.+ Gorgeous matte screen with fantastic color reproduction. The quality of the screen is right in line with the best Ultrabooks. With the screen not having a glossy finish as on most other laptops, the colors may not look quite as rich.+ As somewhat of an overall trend of manufacturers moving from 14” screens to 13.3”, this laptop maintains the larger 14” display with slim bezels. This allows for increased productivity meanwhile keeping the ultimate portability.+ Speakers are second to none in the Ultrabook market. Asus had the space and took advantage of it to install the largest speakers they could. The sound in movies and music is extremely natural and is actually pleasant to listen to. With that being said, even though the speakers are remarkable for an Ultrabook, they will not be replacing any dedicated external speakers.+ Fan noise is much more muted than that of the competition. The laptop prioritizes lower noise over thermals. This is both a pro and a con depending on the ultimate end use / longevity. The processor has a thermal limit of 100*C and the laptop will routinely hit 98*C when under heavy load. The fan will definitely be audible at such loads, but the ramping up will be more gradual than found on the competition’s high performance Ultrabooks.+ Lap friendly design with no cooling vents on the bottom of the laptop. The same cannot be said for most of the competition where such use will block the cooling vents and cause the laptop to run much hotter.+ The base of the laptop is aluminum, the bezel around the screen is plastic, and the lid is a “glass-like” finish. What you essentially get is a laptop that is more forgiving to accidental bumps and better cooling potential due to the aluminum base. Touchscreen laptops on the other hand have glass screens that are much more prone to cracking when bumped or dropped.+ Ambient light sensor for screen brightness control. Upon receipt of the laptop, the maximum brightness of the screen may look dim with the setting turned on. When, turning it off by pressing FN + A key, actual maximum brightness can be achieved.+ Concealed exhaust and intake fan vents for an overall clean look.+ Backlit keyboard with 3 levels of brightness.+ Provided are a laptop sleeve, a Micro HDMI-to-HDMI adapter, and a USB-to-LAN adapter.","Cons:The cons listed should not be deal breakers, but should be taken into consideration when comparing with competitors’ offerings.- Audible coil whine from the motherboard when doing any processor intensive tasks. When fan is on low speed or off, the whine is very much noticeable.- Soldered RAM (8GB) on the motherboard with no option to replace / upgrade to higher capacity.- SATA Based 256GB Sandisk SSD is used in lieu of NVMe based SSD. Even though the slot on the motherboard will allow for SSD upgrades to higher capacity ones, NVMe based drives will not be compatible and cannot be used. To put the raw speed between the two types of drives in perspective, the SATA SSD will top out at around 550MB/s, NVMe SSD will top out at around 3,500MB/s.- Power button is placed above the Backspace key. With the default settings in place, it will put the computer to sleep when pressed. Luckily the default action of the power button can be set to “Do Nothing” within Windows.- Throttling of the processor during prolonged high demand loads. Due to the cooling space constraints, the laptop will slow down to keep it from overheating. This is the case with every other Ultrabook on the market which come with a Core i5-8250u or i7-8550u processor.- The top of the lid has an extremely shiny finish to it that is very much susceptible to scuffs and scratches, and extra care needs to be taken to keep it clean. The new laptop arrived with two noticeable scratches already on the lid. The top should have been kept aluminum with no additional finishes just as found on the aluminum base.- USB port is slightly shorter than standard, this means that anything the user may plug in will stick out a bit more than it should. Wireless mouse receivers that are usually left plugged in will have a higher chance of catching and damaging the USB port.- The fingerprint reader is located on the touchpad. It should have been placed elsewhere on the palm rest or integrated into the power button as on some competitors’ laptops.- No way to cycle the Fn key with F-Key functionality. The only way to change settings such as volume, screen brightness, keyboard backlighting, etc. via the keyboard is to hold down the Fn Key and press the appropriate F-Key. In instances where the user adjusts such settings more often than using the actual F1-F12 keys, there should be an option to just press the appropriate F-key.- Somewhat of an oddity, when the screen is turned off due to inactivity or pressing Fn + F7 key to turn it off, the laptop will turn off the WIFI and act as if it’s half-asleep. If listening to online radio, it will continue playing what has been buffered to that point and then stop due to a lack of network connection. Moving the mouse or pressing any key will prompt you with the login screen. The network connection immediately gets reestablished and the online radio is resumed. Similarly, when doing a large download and leaving the PC unattended, the download will fail when the screen is turned off. This happens with all Sleep settings in the Power Options set to Never. As of right now the only way to avoid this happening is by disabling the Screen Power Off settings and enabling just a Blank screensaver after x amount of time. That of course will reduce the battery life.","Other Thoughts:The following is what is made available on competitors’ Ultrabooks that is not found on this Asus UX430UN: Glossy glass touchscreen with pen support, Fast NVMe SSD, 2-in-1 functions allowing the laptop screen to be rotated 180 degrees and used as a tablet. The additional features will definitely come with a price premium especially when trying to match the exceptional features such as the quad-core i7 processor, 14” screen, and memory on this laptop.As of right now Ultrabook options are abundant and this Asus Ultrabook should not be overlooked.",2,1
ASUS,UX430UN-NB71,2,I am not sure...,2018-10-01,Pros:- Super light/thin- Affordable- Relatively good Spec- Nice keyboards,"Cons:- It's 1/2 month-old laptop and it already made the coil noises when updating windows for the first time - concerning.- I have absolutely no idea why but its touchpad freezes for a good minute when loading a webpage on chrome. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!- After spending some time researching, I realised that these issues are common AND unsolvable.- Though it's well-known for a good battery life, I don't experience such long battery life on this.  I haven't gotten a chance to play any games or played videos yet, only websurfing.- Yes, it was GeForce MX150 was one of the main reasons I chose this computer, but apparently it throttles aggressively with high loads (you can easily find other reviews on this issue).","Other Thoughts:- I cannot say that I would recommend this to a friend because of the issues stated above though it's a tempting deal.- I am considering to get an exchange with the same model.  If the next one has the same issues, I will most likely get a different laptop, which is sad :(",5,2

SD card sticks halfway out so that you can't really just leave it in there and forget about it. I wasn't a fan of the micro hdmi port since it requires an adapter and the port itself looked to be more susceptible  to damage. All the reviews for the 430 describe a metal casing, but this one has a plastic lid. It feels cheap and bends and is pretty flimsy.",Other Thoughts:I'd spend a couple hundred more and get the full model.,6,3
HP,250 G7 (5YN09UT#ABA),5,Perfect college laptop,2019-02-02,"Pros:Long battery life, lightweight, very fast.",Cons:None yet.,Other Thoughts:Bought this for college work and so far it's done everything that I could ever want from a laptop.

ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,1,,2019-03-20,"Pros:Other then the good look, this laptop is nothing.","Cons:This computer is a piece of garbage and ASUS warranty on it is a joke. Here is the reason, I used mine for 2 - 3 weeks after buying it brand new and the power went completely dead. I sent it to ASUS, they kept it for a month and said it couldn't be repair because the were no parts available so they sent me a refurbished one as a replacement.As a military veteran, I felt cheated and rob of something that I really needed for school. All my information I had on the dead computer were kept by ASUS. I will be reaching to the VA out reach team to further up on this issue with ASUS.

ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,2,i expect more. this should be a 5 star purchase but..,2019-03-08,"Pros:screen  has great quality, lightweight, fast","Cons:screen clarity is  good, but too dark at times. you can play with certain system display settings to make it brighter but kind of a hassle. the real issue is the track pad. it randomly decides to stick and the mouse pointer will be stuck. very frequently, every 5 mins or so of use. the screen issue isnt that big of the deal but the trackpad issue is so annoying I have decided to return this. although it was a great deal for the specs I am still paying way too much money for this laptop to put up with this",,0,2

I am very surprised on it's performance compared to what laptops used to be compared to computers.I mean, I can actually game on it, no issues at all, and at good setting, SSD is very fast, CPU is not quite up there with my home rig with it's i7-7700K OC'd to 4.9 GHz or it's dual OC'd video cards........ But       IT     WILL    GAME         and do so fairly well.I ran this thing through every Torture test I know, even OCCT PSU for 24 hours, and it never blinked an eye. Heck I even had to reinstall windows because of the testing I did HAHA.All in all I find this Laptop acceptable in every aspect, as a Primary Gaming Computer it's not quite up to my standards, but I am an extremist I suppose. When I was in College I would have killed for a laptop like this.I'm sure I will enjoy this laptop for years to come at work, and maybe even game on it more when we are not busy.",5,1
ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,"ASUS ZenBook 15 Intel Whiskey Lake Core i7-8565U, 16 GB DDR4, 512 GB PCIe SSD, GTX 1050 Max-Q, IR Camera, Ultra-Slim Compact15.6"" FHD 4-Way NanoEdge, Windows 10 Laptop - UX533FD-DH74",2019-01-28,"Pros:-Built in IR camera-Intel Whiskey Lake Core i7-8565U-16 GB DDR4-512 GB PCIe SSD-GTX 1050 Max-Q-TrackpadI really like how the track pad buttons are literally part of the track pad, instead of them being beveled like most track pads.As the bevels tend to get gunk built up in them over time.-Back-lit KeyboardHonestly this should be a standard on all laptops. I'm glad asus added this feature to this laptop.-ScreenThis screen has amazing clarity, definitely the best i have seen on a laptop.Even includes a micro-fiber cloth for cleaning the finger prints on the screenand lid. Yes this whole laptop is a finger print magnet.-BatteryBetter than most laptops this size from 2018 and prior. Batteries have come a long way.-Power cordIt may sound weird but I really like this square black charging block. Very compact, Unlikethe older ones I remember.-BloatwareHonestly there was more bloatware installed by default from Microsoft than ASUS.I think all I un-installed was ASUS sync and the dropbox app that works with it.And of course all the Microsoft games that that app store pre-installs.-BiosThe Bios is no frills, But it is full UEFI. And you can boot BOOTX64.EFI from a USB devicefrom the setup menu. There is no fan controls, or anything else interesting to tweak in the bios.it is definitely bare bones on options. Or they are hidden from the end user.-EthernetI like the direction that oem's are taking with peripherals. Most of these devices can just be USB add-onsless open ports for things to get stuck in, or gunked up.-CaseYes it's a basic case, or laptop pillow case. But who cares it comes with it. And you don't have to rush outand get one right away.",Cons:-Not Windows 10 ProFor the Price point this should have come with the pro version... Just saying!,"Other Thoughts:This is newer technology being used in this laptop, Hense the price point.The build quality is solid, It doesn't feel cheap or flimsy on any part of it.Cooling system is super quiet. I cannot for the life of me even here the fans.If you are a Student or a light gamer this is a good buy. with a GTX 1050you should be able to play mobas, etc. e.g. light to med graphic games.You might be able to run some AAA games on low settings but I wouldn'ttry it while on battery.",2,0
ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,Great Work Laptop with Decent Gaming Capabilities,2019-01-26,"Pros:This is a medium-large, very thin laptop with a very bright, clear 1920*1080 IPS display, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB NVMe PCIe SSD, Core i7-8565U CPU, and nVidia GTX 1050 Max-Q GPU.The screen and keyboard are the best I've seen on a laptop--the bezel on the screen is very thin, looks like maybe 1/4 inch, and the keyboard has a real numeric keypad on the right side, which is wonderful for typists.For work, productivity, web browsing, and pretty much all routine tasks, this laptop is blazing fast.You can play games on it, but it's not a gaming laptop and its GPU is not the equal of its CPU or SSD.  I tested with the 2016 reboot of DOOM. On OpenGL using all Ultra settings, the game is not really playable, with framerates dropping as low as 15 fps.  All High settings raises that to 25-30, but only on Medium does the game become fluid enough to play well, with framerates in the 45-60 range. Switching to Vulkan only works for the High and below presets, as the 2 GB video RAM isn't enough for Ultra quality.  On both High and Medium quality, framerates are basically the same as with OpenGL.  Note that again, because of the 2 GB video RAM, when using Vulkan,  you have to exit the game and run it again every time you change the quality setting in Vulkan mode.The audio quality on this laptop is good.  with decent volume.  The sound is clear.  At high volume, treble response overwhelms vocal and bass range; the balance is much improved, though still of course weak on the bass side, if you pull the volume down to 50% - 75%.Battery life is very good for a laptop this thin, looks like for browsing and productivity you could have six hours or more.  Do a lot of gaming and that number comes down considerably, my testing indicates three to four hours with heavy gaming.  Still, not bad, as this is almost triple the battery life that my work-provided laptop offers.The display quality is amazing, bright and clear and without much dimming or color shift when viewed from an angle.  There are no stuck or dead pixels on the laptop display.Connectivity is good, with a MicroSD card reader, a SUB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-C / DisplayPort combo port, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports (USB 2 compatible), and an HDMI port, giving you two options for connecting external video.  Power and charge indicator lights are available on the right side beside the card reader.  The external power connector is also on the right side panel at the very rear.","Cons:A drive activity light would be nice--certainly not a deal-breaker.  There really aren't many other complaints I would have, except for not being a great fan of Windows 10.  I wish Microsoft would stop patterning their OS after their (now defunct) phone design, and design a GUI for a desktop operating system again.The ""case"" deserves mention. The laptop comes with a kind of slip-case cover, almost like a very thin black pillowcase, that secures with velcro.  This isn't my favorite sort of case, and has no handles or carrying straps.  Be careful when putting the laptop in the case that your grip on the laptop doesn't slip.  I recommend replacing the case with a real laptop case.","Other Thoughts:This laptop has high-end features that are appropriate for its price point.  I do wish it had a stronger GPU with more video RAM, but I doubt many people would consider buying this if they are looking primarily for a gaming laptop.This is a powerful laptop packed with the latest technology, and using it is a real pleasure.",3,0
ASUS,UX533FD-DH74,5,Sleek and Spunky,2018-12-12,"Pros:The 8565u was the main feature that sold me, boosting to 4.6, making short work of any applications.  The screen continuing all the way to the hinge gives it a sleek look making it appear as if there is no bezel on the bottom of the screen. No complaints on 16 GB of ram and 512gb SSD, should be plenty.","Cons:No major issues so far only one minor issue that the bugs me, the chassis. I am coming from an XPS 13 and the chassis on it was solid. The aluminum clam-shell design of the XPS is far superior to the plastic chassis of the Zenbook. Whenever I close my labtop and grab it to put it away, feeling the lid of my labtop flex just bugs the hell out of me.","Other Thoughts:I was torn between this or a new XPS. I was leaning towards the XPS 13 because I was familiar with them and didn't have issues before,  but the value of the Zenbook was too much to pass. I got this on sale for 1199 pre-tax, while a similar XPS 13 would have been closer to 1500.",11,0
