DELL,E5450,4,Updated Review: 10/09/2018,2018-10-09,Pros:Nice size.,"Cons:UPDATE: October 9, 2018Joy Systems sent me another laptop and this one works great! Although it was a major hassle for me to complete this purchase, Joy Systems worked to make sure I was satisfied. I now recommend them for refurbished electronics.-----Joy Systems sent me a laptop with a defective mouse pad. Right button did not work. I sent it back for repair, which meant I might not be able to take it on the business trip I purchased it for. I asked for expedited return shipping so I could take it with me, but they said they couldn't do that even if I paid. I then asked if they could ship it to my business trip location and they took the address, but still sent it to my home address. Back home, I used it for a couple of times to just get it set up. Then the hard drive failed. While I usually buy refurbished, I won't buy one from Joy Systems again.",,0,0

I now enjoy blazing speed working in the cloud.","Cons:Weight.  The laptop is heavier than I expected.  Granted, this was one detail I didn't research before my purchase.  It isn't too heavy, just heavier than I expected.First laptop had to be retruend as many pixels were not working.  This might be a ""Pro"" has the return was easy and they shipped a new laptop fairly quickly.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this laptop and I would buy it again.

They sent me a link that doesnt work and only respond 48 hours after email. Can never get a live body which would fix problem in no time, instead I sit with a non functioning laptop for a week hoping I get another email so that I can fix their product.

HP,6460B,4,"Very Strong, Weird Textures",2015-11-24,"Pros:Very solid, fast laptop that runs beautifully and does all of my mobile work and minor gaming that I want it to for the relatively cheap price.","Cons:Its keyboard and trackpad textures are very grainy and give it a weird feel. Due to the design of the laptop, you will also sometimes tap the trackpad ,thus moving your cursor location, while in the middle of typing.","Other Thoughts:Other than the above, it works very well for the price (~$300) and I would give it 4.5/5 if I could as the only major issue is the annoying texturing.",0,0
HP,8570P,3,"Nice computer, but I am on my 3rd one",2017-05-27,"Pros:Fast, nice finish, durable, graphics card, overall nice laptop","Cons:Heavy and no backlit keyboard, but I knew this before purchasing","Other Thoughts:Overall experience with this purchase was not great. The first laptop I received had a bad fan, you could hear it rattling across the house. So, I contacted the third party company that Newegg sells these computers for. They told me I could return it to them for repair (the whole computer, they will not send out parts), but basically told me it would be easier if I sent it back through Neweggs return system, which was fine. But, they told me if I returned it through Newegg then I could get another computer before they received the broken one, which is NOT TRUE. But anyway, I sent that one back and once Newegg got it back and it was approved, I received another one. I got the new one in and the fan was also very loud on it, and the charging port was very loose, almost to the breaking point. I immediately boxed it back up and sent it back as well. So, a while later, I received the third one in the mail, which is the one I still have now. It works great, the only complaint I have on it is the hinges that open and closes the lid are a little loose. It Is not as solid as the previous two, but I did not want to send it back again. It also had stickers over the keys on the keyboard, but they were no problem to take off. The previous two laptops also had a genuine HP charger, which this one does not. Battery life is decent considering it is the original battery. I made the first purchase 2/2/17, and finally got this all resolved 3/21/17, when I received the third laptop, so this was a very long process.I knew this would be a refurbished laptop, but I expected things to play out a little better than they did. If the first laptop would have been good then I would have rated this 5 stars easy. I would recommend buying this laptop, just beware that you might get something that you will have to immediately send back. If you get one with no problems first try, then you have better luck than me!",0,0
Lenovo,T420,1,WARNING: No Power Supply,2015-07-27,"Pros:I expect I will like it, but haven't gotten to starting it up yet. Low rating is just because of the lack of P/S.","Cons:Arrived without a power supply, what I think should be a standard part. The customer service representative from Newegg acted like I should have had no reasonable expectation for the P/S to be included, since it wasn't listed as an accessory. She offered me a $5 credit as a ""courtesy"", but I thought that was insufficient. She agreed to $15, so now I have to go out and buy a P/S somewhere. Not happy I had to go through this process, but better a $15 credit than nothing. I should have asked for $25.",Other Thoughts:I have been a Newegg customer for more than 10 years and always recommend them. This is only the second (maybe third) negative experience I've had.,0,0
DELL,E5450,5,Great deal in a refurbished laptop.,2018-07-21,Pros:Great deal in a refurbished laptop. Looks like it is brand new.,Cons:No cons thus far.,Other Thoughts:The laptop came via Joy Systems. very happy with them.,0,0

Lenovo,T440P,5,Refurbished but almost new,2017-12-13,Pros:Simple design that makes a lot of sense. Fast CPU and lots of memory. These laptops are work horses that are perfect for any business.,Cons:The touchpad could use some improvement. I prefer the touchpads on the T420's.,"Other Thoughts:We purchase a lot of used and new products for our business. I find these Lenovo laptops are priced just right for what we need. The T series allows users to use a docking station which is great for mobile users. I also like that fact that these laptops can be completely upgraded without much hassle. Swapping memory, hard drive, or even the cpu is done fairly easy.The seller we purchased from (JoySystems) delivers our products very clean and well packaged. It's hard to tell these are used. Plus they provide a 1 year warranty which is great!",0,0
DELL,E6500,1,Very disappointed in both the laptop and the customer service.,2017-10-02,Pros:There has been nothing positive about this experience.,"Cons:This laptop looked good when I took it out of the box. After closer inspection I noticed that one corner of the screen was missing a screw or latch, because it separates easily. When I started using it, I noticed quickly that the touchpad buttons were old and sticky, and it was nearly impossible to use the touchpad effectively, forcing me to go buy a mouse. The overall performance of the laptop is acceptable, but the battery is basically DOA. After less than 15 minutes of heavy use (full screen video) or 35-40 minutes of regular use (spreadsheets, web browsing), the battery completely dies.I spent some time on newegg's live chat explaining the problems, noting that I would prefer not to RMA the entire unit, but would be satisfied if they sent a replacement battery. After several minutes of inactivity following being told this wasn't possible, the agent left the chat.So I called the customer service number, and explained the situation over again. Again I was told that the only means of solution was to box the laptop up and send it back. I explained that this is extremely inconvenient and I would just like to be sent a new battery or a partial refund so I could purchase a battery myself. The answer again was 'no'.So I now have a $250 laptop with a DOA battery, a touchpad that is so worn out it doesn't work, and a loosely connected screen. I could have purchased a brand new laptop at a box store for the same money and at least had a year warranty.","Other Thoughts:I will never purchase another refurbished computer from newegg.ca and I recommend that folks use extreme caution when doing so, because I have had a very unhappy purchase experience with this laptop. All it would have taken to make me a satisfied customer was arrange for a replacement battery or issue a partial refund, but they will just keep repeating the same thing - ""send it back"".Very unhappy customer here.",0,0
Lenovo,T540P,5,"SUPERB Laptop.  Everything I needed & more.  Fast, quiet & easy to use.",2018-04-27,"Pros:I had been using a rather lousy laptop for doing recording of Audiobooks.  In the editing process in particular, I would delete 2 seconds & then I would have to wait 10 for the computer to be ready to do anything, resulting in all kinds of time wasted.ZERO lag time on this laptop.2 nights ago we were casting a movie to our tv from my wifes HP.  It was sluggish & kept pausing.  I said ""try mine.""    We had thought it was our internet connection speed.  Nope.  With this laptop casting it, we were able to stream HD with no lag.  Yay!!Also,   I love having a standard size keyboard with 10 key.  Not many laptops that have that.  Not the reason I bought it, in fact I didn't even notice it until after I had clicked order, but I'm glad I got it.Display is nice & a good size.All kinds of ports are great.Still having an optical drive is nice too.And the thing is built like a tank.","Cons:Whose 'brilliant' Idea was it to put the function key where ctrl is on a normal keyboard?  That's been my only frustration with it so far.  I'm a keyboard shortcut kind of guy, but when I click what I think is ctrl-A  and nothing happens, its a letdown.  I've had it for a week and I can't tell you how many times I've hit the wrong key there.  I'm sure I'll get used to it.Also, Battery life is a little lower than I would hope.  I usually will have it plugged in, but it would be nice if it lasted more than just a few hours.aaand... No HDMI port.  I'll live.","Other Thoughts:Don't waste $150-300 on a low end laptop that will start telling you it doesn't have enough memory for updates in 6 months when you can spend just a little more and get this tank.  I'm sold. When we need to get a new laptop for our store in another 3 months, we'll spend a little more & get this or something like it.This is portable & powerful & that's what I needed.",0,0
DELL,E6220,4,"Great, lightweight ultrabook.  Slight cosmetic blemishes",2017-06-18,"Pros:Relatively fast, lightweight and rugged.Windows 10 PRO working very wellEasy to upgrade.Product came with the Web Cam!",Cons:Cosmetic blemishes,"Other Thoughts:I would recommend this refurbished ultrabook.This is a refurbished, not a new system, so there were some cosmetic issues, but the metal construction should last a long time.Cosmetic Issues:I had to tack down the corner of the touch-pad.The top strip came off the cover.  I've just left the rubber strip beneath it exposed.The bottom plate screw was stripped and held in by gum.  I had to thread in a slightly larger screw to secure the base, but it is working fine now.Windows 10 PRO is working better than I would have thought.  No issues with most drivers or hardware.I did have a problem with the driver for my laser printer.  I had to install the Windows 7 Brother driver when I couldn'tfigure out which setting to use in the Windows 10 options.My unit came with a Web Cam that the web site said would not be there and that was a bonus I didn't expect.The Dell keyboard is more traditional rather than the ""chicklet"" keys on most ultrabooks.All in all, I got an Ultrabook from Dell for $229.",0,0

Lenovo,T540P,5,Fantastic Laptop for the Price,2018-10-19,"Pros:An SSD is absolutely essential for most Windows 10 machines, but especially for a laptop.  This machines 256GB SSD is a reasonable size.  Add given the quality that is inherent in Lenova's Thinkpad line, it is an ideal laptop.  Although this machine was originally designed and sold in 2014, its spec still holds up.  The screen resolution is absolutely amazing with a very advanced graphics card.   It has a ""Thunderbolt"" mini-display port that supports HDMI  The machine I got was definitely ""A Grade"", which is important for a refurbished machine.  Note that although it is listed as not having an optical drive, I actually got one as well as a fingerprint reader.  Just the luck of the draw.","Cons:I've mentioned the graphics card, the high resolution, and HDMI.  I used an adapter to connect to a 4K TV and found that although it definitely produces 4K, the I5 apparently limits streaming at that rate.  Newer Thinkpads have I7 which might be useful for heavy computation, 4K streaming or VR.","Other Thoughts:Although not part of the specification, the machine I originally received had a fingerprint reader.  I determined that it was defective and, remarkably, Joy Systems offered  me a replacement.  I found Joy Systems customer service to be quite responsive for a small company.  I worked with Jorge Escorcia, who helped with the diagnosis and the shipping.  I now have a great laptop with a working fingerprint reader.",1,0
Lenovo,T450S,4,Looks good so far,2018-12-03,"Pros:First refurbished laptop I've bought and wasn't sure what to expect for a Grade B, but physical condition is excellent.  Few scuffs here and there but overall very happy.","Cons:Can't comment on the screen or keyboard or if it even turns on yet as it came with the wrong AC Adapter.  It came with this one '42T4430', which doesn't fit the T450s.  Trying to get in touch with Newegg support to get the correct adapter.  If there's a better way to go about this than through live chat, let me know.UPDATE: Newegg directed me to contact ArrowDirect and they shipped me the correct AC Adapter.  All is working well now.","Other Thoughts:I used a ThinkPad around 10 years ago when I did tech support and software training, and it's still my favorite computer.  Hoping this one is just as good.",0,0
Lenovo,T420S,5,Good Deal; works like new,2018-08-15,Pros:I have bought refurbished laptops before and this one is one of the good ones.  Everything works perfectly and looks physically in good shape.  Very few visible scratches.  Windows 10 was easy to setup and key provided worked fine.  Battery life so far looks good.  I saved a few hundred bucks here and feel good I choose the refurbish route.,Cons:There are no cons.,Other Thoughts:I would definitely buy another refurbished laptop again especially if by this same vender.,2,0
HP,6470B,5,Greate Enterprise Laptop,2017-10-12,Pros:The laptop is 4 years old and looks brand new.  2 tiny dents on the top are the only wear I can see.  Seriously. I might not return a new computer that dents that small.  Enterprise class machine so accessing the innards is a breeze.  Move a switch on the bottom of the case and an access panel comes off exposing everything.  This is my 2nd used HP Elitebook and I am impressed with the build quality of both.,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I have decided that used enterprise class laptops are a much better deal than new low end laptops for the same price.,0,0
HP,8460P,3,Warranty Woes,2016-06-08,Pros:CostWarranty,"Cons:It appears from looking at this item that the 1 year warranty is via HP.  It to me appeared that HP was offering the product.However this product is actually provided via a 3rd party.  The HD on our unit is failing, it happens, but we have had to contact Newegg in order to start the warranty claim process.  They informed us it will be between 3-7 business days to get things taken care of.  Since the guy we sent this to can't be without a computer for that long, we are sending him into the local best buy to purchase a laptop.  Making this savings for us, a huge cost.  I will update with review based on our warranty experience.",,0,0
Lenovo,W541,3,"Good Laptop, but took three returns to get what I was promised",2019-02-21,Pros:Fair price for a very strong high performance laptop workstation. Came with Nvidia card.,"Cons:The unit is listed as Grade A. The first laptop came in with damaged charger or battery and would not charge. The replacement unit arrived with damaged plastic parts on the rear Ethernet port, plus some other visible cosmetic damage. The third replacement unit was in great shape and I decided to keep it. However, after a while the battery started giving me problems. The unit would not charge when on or off. Some troubleshooting fixed the problem. The battery does not hold the charge for long.","Other Thoughts:When talking to the Joy Systems, organization that provides warranty for these laptops, I had to convince the rep. that when unit is titled as Grade A, then it must not have any visible cosmetic damage, not to mention battery problems. I hate to return products, since I spend time to research items and vendors and usually rely on the accuracy of the advertising page. In this case, I am disappointed that such a nice laptop is being sold with cheap replacement battery, which does not hold charge for a long time and can give problems when charging. The unit's price around $580 must tell buyers that the battery must be of high quality. If it is not, then what is the point in paying around $600 for a refurbished unit and get poorly functioning  battery?",0,0

DELL,E5440,4,Pleasantly Surprised,2018-02-07,"Pros:Packaging:The first thing that I would like to mention is the packaging by this vendor, for it was very professional looking. The laptop came in a well protected box with an individually packaged power brick. The laptop itself was wrapped in cellophane; the product key was provided on the bottom of the device; and there was a screen protector between the keyboard and screen.Speed:This laptop had an I5 core processor with 1.90GHz base speed. The dual core CPU, along with the 8 GB of RAM, makes this device a great workstation. The updates are fast; program installation speeds are moderate; and the wireless card works wonders even two floors below my modem.Feel:For a typical consumer: this Dell Latitude E5440 is more that acceptable for daily use. I'm a college student - an English major at that - and I have already brought this device to class, taking notes throughout the duration, and I had no problem connecting to the school's WIFI to upload my in-class assignment.For a moderate tech-head: I built a desktop two years ago that absolutely destroys multitasking needs; downloads and uploads at obscene rates; and I have zero lag thanks to 32GB of RAM, 500GB SSD, and a GTX 1060. Because of my desktop, I am always skeptical of purchasing a laptop. However, the more that I am advancing into my schooling, and the more a laptop seemed practical, so I set aside $300 to buy something refurbished. I was a bit apprehensive about this device because of the lack of an SSD, and the fact that the CPU is a 4th generation, but I bought the device anyways. I am pleased to announce that this laptop has been very pleasing in terms of usability for a heavy multitasker such as myself. I am able to watch YouTube videos, stream Netflix, and complete basic coding tasks without lag.My scaling:Wireless Usability - 8/10Keyboard - 6/10Screen Quality - 8/10Touchpad - 7/10Build Quality - 9/10Battery Life - 6/10","Cons:I really believe that a 128GB SSD would have been a better suit for this device, however, that is not why I am taking off an egg. I docked a single egg because the fingerprint reader on my device is not working, which isn't that important because I did not know it was on there before hand, but I expected the laptop to be fully functioning upon arrival. Still, I cannot fault the provider for this aspect because those are the risks one takes when buying a refurbished unit.","Other Thoughts:I recommend this product to anyone who wants a great laptop without needing to sell an organ. The device is very usable, even now in February of 2018, and the layout makes this laptop easy to upgrade.",0,0
