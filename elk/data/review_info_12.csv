HP,640 G1,4,Great product - but beware Edege and Explorer,2018-06-15,"Pros:First of all newegg got this computer to me super fast - days early. The comp is fast enough for my needs (home office work, streaming) and while the 14"" screen isn't optimal for video, it does make biking with it in my backpack much better than my prior 17"" screen. Settings allow you to easily tone down the sensitivity on the touch-mouse, which is huge for me as many previous laptops didn't allow that and caused me much frustration (heavy hands I guess). This isn't a gaming computer, and it does bog a bit when I run large database analysis programs (R, Python) but it still gets the job done well. A great product for the price","Cons:The biggest gripe I have is that the comp comes loaded with Windows 10 Home and Micro Edge. The only browser by default is Explorer (which I hate) - despite resetting Edge multiple times I still couldn't get explorer to download any other browser (Firefox or Chrome) successfully - it kept downloading those programs as text files. A simple fix was to download both exe files onto my external (using my desktop) and then run them from there onto the laptop. Once this was done the internet issues (slow loading, failure to load video, failure to block pop-ups) all magically vanished.Again this is a small screen - which for me is a plus do to carrying this around a lot - but others may find the size a tad too small for their needs.",,1,0
Lenovo,X240,1,Caveat Emptor...,2018-05-06,Pros:Fast - when it was operational (which was exactly 7 days before SSD failure],"Cons:Screen - appears on last legs... yellowish, dingy, dim even after trying several adjustmentsKeyboard - they put stickers on all keys and touch surfaces so you don’t see wear and tear, font is a bit goofy and everything (including cover surfaces) has these weird sharp edges from stickers... how long till they peel  off??SSD - as noted it bricked after a week of mostly installation tasks... service rep with thick accent said they would send me a “new refurbished” SSD for free, which means I’ll probably spend my own money to make sure i’’m not in this boat again in a month - but he didn’t ask for any info or diagnostics... I got distinct impression this is a common occurance for them... seemed relieved when I said could install myselfBattery - empties in an hour, they said they tested it to verify it holds a charge...  so if I keep ai guess I’ll need to order a new battery as well","Other Thoughts:Advertised as sold by Newegg and “Grade-A” refurb... I would NEVER go this route again; if I have to buy my own SSD and r install from scratch, and buy a new battery, and look at this dingy yellow screen after weeks of getting it working again, what’s the point? I honestly haven’t been this disappointed or frustrated by a company/purchase in a long time. Seriously, don’t waste your money - get something new with lesser performance if budget constrained... I’m still trying to figure out if I just consider the money flushed down the toilet or if I try and make it useful until it’s next fatal issue.",0,0
HP,6470B,2,Refurbished?,2017-02-14,Pros:It works,Cons:I've never seen a more poorly refurbished item. Stickers to cover the wear on the keyboard instead of replacing the keyboard? Actual physical damage including a few dents to the exterior of the laptop and it looks like it was dropped on one corner and then filled with epoxy.,Other Thoughts:I will never buy a refurbished item again. Apparently the definition of that word have changed over the years. The price i got it for is the only reason it's getting a second star,0,0
Apple,FF841LL/A,5,Refurbished unit but in like new condition,2016-12-23,Pros:not a mark on itfast shipping,Cons:no issues,,0,0
DELL,E6420,4,"Good laptop, but not what's shown in picture",2018-06-28,Pros:- Fast- Works great for internet browsing and using Office- Very good value- Looks almost brand new,Cons:-The picture for this laptop is wrong. It does not come with a number pad.,,1,0
Acer,A515-51-513F,5,Great product--easy to setup and use,2019-02-18,"Pros:-fast startup from the 256 Gb SSD-lighted keyboard! (this was a bonus feature that was a most pleasant surprise)--turns on by default when plugged in, Fn+F9 key combination turns on/off on battery-long batt life (8 hrs+, but I""m not a gamer)-quick performance from the I5 8th gen chip  (made quicker by adding 16 Gb RAM--you need to swap out 4Gb RAM card for 16 Gb--not really a requirement but I made the swap--for those who have made RAM upgrades, this is a 5 minute task)-noticeably quicker than Dell 5580 (I5 7th gen chip) I use for work-keyboard has a nice feel to it, and laptop hinges don't feel weak or wobbly.","Cons:-WiFi is ok, but could be improved (this has been noted in other reviews)--no hiccups or issues even with streamed video, but heavier users could find it limiting-screen is good, but not a ""wow!""--again, this is a budget model","Other Thoughts:-yes, I would recommend this product-this is a budget model that competes with performance well outside its price range-purchased a refurbished model, arrived in just like new condition.",2,0
DELL,M6800,5,4 CORES / 8 THREADS up to 3.7Ghz boost,2018-05-17,"Pros:Desktop like performance240GB SSD17.3"" 1080p screen & 16GB DDR3 1600 (11-11-11 1T)",Cons:Huge beast.,"Other Thoughts:Had to activate windows, not an issue the key is on the bottom of laptop but just be aware.A 4 core 8 thread Haswell @3.7 turbo is still a great cpu in 2018Basically, this is a desktop replacement w/o gaming.",0,0
Lenovo,X131E,3,Average cheap laptop,2019-02-24,Pros:Cheap,Cons:Slow,"Other Thoughts:Got this laptop for my son for school.  Being a programmer, I knew it wasn't going to be fast, but it was VERY slow .  I did some research and it seemed like there were people who were able to add more RAM even though it says the max was 8GB.  I decided to try upgrading the memory using https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231705 - it worked exactly as I had hoped...MUCH faster and now usable.",0,0
Lenovo,T520,4,Works Great!,2017-01-29,Pros:The unit works perfectly and is very fast with the SSD Drive.,"Cons:This unit should have been advertised as ""B"" Grade. First of all, if you have to cover all the keys on the keyboard and the top of the unit with black textured stick on covering, that is ""B"" Grade in my book. Second,  there are spots on the lower rear corner that looks like some kind of chemical etched the case, along with a gouge that was painted over.  Good thing it is not noticeable when viewed directly from the front by the user. If I bought this for my self I would have retutrn it! Luckily my customer is not concerned with these blemishes.","Other Thoughts:I specifically chose this rebuilder because of the very high quality I have seen in their refurbished computers in the past. I have purchased and sold three laptops refurbished by Joy Systems. All three were ""A"" grade, looked and ran like new. One came with the wrong Optical drive. I made contact with these folks and they sent me the correct one right away...great warr service and good folks to deal with. I am going to let this one go, but the next unit I get that looks like this, I will return for a refund, take pictures, make contact letting them know why I returned it.",0,0
Lenovo,T420,5,Awesome product,2016-11-21,"Pros:Think Pad with core 5 , 8 gb , 256 gb ssd and win pro 10. Every thing i asked for and works perfect. At a considerable savings.",Cons:No issues,Other Thoughts:I would recomend this.,0,0
HP,8570P,1,Y-2k issue,2017-04-06,Pros:Almost there,Cons:Laptop came with 2 letter K keys and no letter T between the letters R and Y.  So seems to be the old Y2k issue.,Other Thoughts:I'll be sending the laptop back.,0,0
DELL,E6540,5,"Fast laptop, very good (Grade A) condition and a fair price.  I will buy my next laptop from Coretec.",2017-11-07,Pros:In very good (Grade A) condition.  Functions perfectly.  Super fast with the Solid State Hard Drive.  Price was very fair at about $400.Attractive design.  This is a business laptop so it's built a little more rugged than a consumer laptop.,"Cons:It's a little heavier and bulky than a consumer laptop, but it's worth it to me since it's more rugged.",Other Thoughts:Delivery was quick.,0,0
DELL,E7440,3,Was Quite Good.  For Awhile.,2018-12-05,"Pros:Good laptop.  Plenty speed, good enough RAM.  With the SSD it actually feels fast.",Cons:Died after 3 1/2 months.,"Other Thoughts:Being that it lasted less than 4 months, I'd not recommend this laptop.",0,0
DELL,E5450,1,Never again,2019-03-04,Pros:It got here quickly,"Cons:It died after 2 weeks of using it.  I was working and it made a pop sound and the screen looked like a black lava lamp.  I also ordered a processor for another computer that didn't work either.  It said it was under warranty and surprise surprise, it's not",Other Thoughts:Buy NEW from a reputable dealer.,0,0
HP,8540P,4,looked and worked like new with minor snafus,2019-03-16,Pros:looked like it was never used -not loaded with bloatware - clean OS installbusiness class machine that is made to be serviced and upgraded easily.,Cons:had a bit of fun figuring out why the USB ports were completely disabled.  even a mouse wouldn't work.  eventually figured out that they had been disabled in the bios.learned a lot about the many ways usb ports can be enabled/disabled or modified to limit their function.,Other Thoughts:for the money this is a solid computer from a good supplier that looks and works as if it were new (in 2010 terms).,0,0
HP,EliteBook 8460p,5,Great product and easy to setup,2019-02-08,"Pros:Great deal, decent specs for the price",Cons:Had a windows 7 and intel sticker on it unfortunately.,Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this product or anything else from this supplier Arrow Direct,0,0
DELL,E6330,5,Extremely clean refurbished,2017-08-14,"Pros:Cosmetically 9/10, better than many refurbished systems I have dealt with.  Hardware works as expected, no bloatware.",Cons:None I can think of.,,0,0
DELL,E6220,1,almost zero support,2019-02-10,Pros:good looking piece of scrap metal,"Cons:Have tried on 3 occasions for their support staff to help me fix what I believe to be a small glitch. They sent me a link that doesnt work and only respond 48 hours after email. Can never get a live body which would fix problem in no time, instead I sit with a non functioning laptop for a week hoping I get another email so that I can fix their product. Where do I send my work card? Since they are asking me to do their repair work for them. Not happy.",Other Thoughts:the product could be excellent but the service and support is minimal. If your not tech savvy consider another company.,0,0
Lenovo,T540P,4,"Great deal, excellent condition, nice specs",2018-09-02,Pros:- Speedy delivery on free tier- Much bigger than expected (large screen and full keyboard)- Fast enough to do software development work and even some gaming,Cons:- Minor scratches expected of a refurb,,0,0
DELL,E7440,5,Great Value,2018-03-31,Pros:-SSD is fast- Compact- Thin- SD Card Reader- Came wrapped in factory plastic. Nicely refurbished,Cons:-The screen has little blemishes. But it is a grade B laptop. I expect some kind of flaws,Other Thoughts:-This is a super deal! This laptop would probably be $600 brand new. For all intents and purposes it is like-new but way cheaper.,0,0
DELL,E6430,5,Works great so far...better than the what I bought from Best Buy and had to take back right away.,2017-03-05,"Pros:Seems robust, fast, not loaded with manufacturer software.",Cons:?,Other Thoughts:Would recommend this product.,0,0
HP,650 G1,4,Great for the price,2018-07-24,Pros:Everything has worked perfect,Cons:Took long to ship,Other Thoughts:Good buy i always go threw newegg on refurbished,1,0
DELL,E6330,4,Like a perfectly good hand-me-down,2017-03-05,Pros:Works perfectly and does everything I need - mainly business and internet. The convenience of the built in optical drive with the smaller footprint is worth the extra weight since it won't travel often. Battery life is good. Can't beat the price for what I'm getting.,"Cons:After just a month, no cons in terms of function. There were a bunch of little dings and it wasn't perfectly clean, like a used car imperfectly detailed.","Other Thoughts:Make sure to get all the drivers, etc. updated before diving in with work.",0,0
HP,810 G2,1,Check it real close to ensure everything's ok,2019-03-16,Pros:Price,"Cons:The vendor never bothered to check the laptop, even when the damage is clearly obvious. Its not the first time I buy B grade used laptops from Newegg, but this one is just unacceptable.The one I got seems to have taken a lot of bashing. Not only there are lots of scratches and chipped paints, the base was actually cracked.  Maybe due to the bashing sustained by the laptop, the wifi would only work intermittently, and at times it wont power on unless plugged. later I discovered that one of the arrow keys doesn't work, but when I wanted to open up the back to see if I can repair it, only to find that the screws are worned out, two of them just can't be unscrewed because the + was so worned out it became a crater. As I am two continents away I am not returning it cause the shipping charges would be killing.",Other Thoughts:Beware and if you buy be prepare for the worse. Check really thoroughly right after receipt. Do a keyboard check to make sure all the keys are usable. By only if you can return without paying for a killing rate of shipping charge,0,0
Lenovo,Helix,1,Just terrible,2018-03-27,"Pros:The low price was attractive, although for such legacy and unconventional form factor it might be expected.","Cons:The model was different than that pictured, and what's worse the included power adapter did not match! As it stands, the system is effectively dead-on-arrival... I cannot even try out the hardware for one minute. Will it work with the right cabling? Who knows. Signs point to additional problems down the road. Should I endure a headache as cost of business or can I expect recompense for my fair trade?",Other Thoughts:This experience was unfortunate as I was looking forward to giving this interesting refurbished hardware a spin. However it has turned out to be entirely a waste of my time and money. Thus I could not recommend such a purchase to anyone at the moment; hopefully post-sale support can sort things out but I am quite annoyed.,4,1
HP,2560P,2,Right out the box didn't work...,2016-12-07,Pros:Was in great condition and looked really nice only had 1 ding and like 2 scratches. Great price especially for the specs on this.,Cons:Wouldn't power on so I'm not sure how it actually performs.,,0,0
DELL,E6530,5,Refurbished Dell Latitude,2018-11-13,"Pros:Excellent refurbishment, like a new machine. It was easy to configure and drop essential software on it. It was well shipped and arrived on time. It was really like getting a new machine.",Cons:No cons really. I bought this machine for someone else and configured it for him. I would never buy a machine with Windows for myself as I use GNU/Linux or BSD for personal use.,Other Thoughts:I do recommend these refurbished machines from Newegg. This is the third on I've bought (usually without OS) and all are excellent. If you can live with technology that is a couple years old there is a great savings buying refurbished. This machine comes with a warranty as well.,0,0
DELL,E6330,4,Great Value! Fast!,2016-07-28,"Pros:- Great value for 128GB SSD, 8GB RAM, 3rd generation Intel Core i5 & Intel HD Graphics 4000- HD webcam- Fast boot-up- 3 USB ports (1 is USB 3.0)- Professionally-looking laptop","Cons:- Loud fan (the loud fan noise made me the ""elephant in the room"" and not in a good way -- Google the phrase ""elephant in the room"" if you don't know what that means)",Other Thoughts:- I would recommend this product to other people; it's a great value.,0,0
Lenovo,T430S,5,Laptop was like new.,2016-12-25,Pros:It's a Thinkpad and they are virtually bullet proof.,Cons:None so far.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this refurbisher.  There were no issues noted.,1,0
DELL,E5450,1,Never again,2019-03-04,Pros:It got here quickly,"Cons:It died after 2 weeks of using it.  I was working and it made a pop sound and the screen looked like a black lava lamp.

DELL,E6420,5,DELL Laptop Latitude E6420,2016-05-17,Pros:Prompt delivery of the Joy Systems refurbished laptop. Clean in every respect and the system delivered exceeded the specs offered: processor speed and memory capacity. One year warranty a big plus.,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:Do not hesitate, great value.",0,0
DELL,E6410,1,Disappointment...,2015-07-15,Pros:None. Got what would have been a great Shell Shocker deal if I'd been shipped a passable unit.,"Cons:Display was broken in a way that would not have been caused during shipping. It was simply ignored during ""refurbishing"".Keyboard was smashed in a corner area, with the result that the 'page-up' key doesn't always register a key stroke.","Other Thoughts:Despite Newegg having a virtually-identical refurbished product in stock (same seller, base model, processor, SSD specs, etc.), I seem to be limited to a product with the very same item number. Very disappointing.",1,0
HP,8460P,5,Use this machine every day. Love it!!!,2017-06-07,Pros:It does everything i need it to on and i have used it daily since purchase with no issues.,Cons:None. Product was exactly what I expected.,Other Thoughts:Great product.,0,0
HP,8570P,3,Nice Specs Kind of,2016-02-18,Pros:Full spec refurb,Cons:Heavy and when I checked installed RAM it indicated only 2GB of RAM total and a single channel.,Other Thoughts:Will contact the refurb company and see if they will make good on the RAM without sending it back.,1,0
DELL,E6430,5,great laptop for the price,2017-12-04,Pros:great price for this refurb product.no issues a week into ownership.,"Cons:none yet.maybe louder on-board speakers, but really... ?",Other Thoughts:quick delivery,0,0
DELL,E5440,5,Great refurb!,2019-01-01,"Pros:For a ""B"" rated refurb this laptop was in pretty nice shape with minimal markings.Windows 10 pro installed and NOTHING else which is a huge plus for me! Absolutely NO bloatware! No ""free trials"" of anything!The BIOS was clean as well.This was better than a new computer in my opinion.There was one small hiccup activating Windows but it was VERY quickly resolved by JoySystem's support crew who replied to me within a few hours via email!Overall I'm VERY happy with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy again!",Cons:None so far.,,0,0
