DELL,E5440,5,Product was exactly as specified. No gimmicks or anything.,2018-06-29,"Pros:-All the specs were exactly as listed. I went to Micro Center for the same Laptop (not the exact same spec wise, but model wise yes) and they actually cheated me out of the innate features that were built-in to the laptop already. Joy Systems managed to refurbish the system really well and keep the innate features.- All the previous data has been wiped. I used a program to verify that they actually wiped the computer properly. They did.- Minimal physical wear and tear. I only noticed 1 slight scratch on inspecting it.- Good usage life left. The battery was only 20% used which is really good for a refurbished.- All in all, great purchase. Would highly recommend.","Cons:- Camera quality is so-so but given the age of the laptop's original release date and improvements on the other specs, it's whatever.","Other Thoughts:I was honestly afraid of getting a refurb online after seeing going to Micro Center and getting an item which was wrongly described online. At least I had the inconvenience of returning it to the store asap, but I figured I'd try online since NewEgg was my other go-to tech supplier. Didn't even know who Joy Systems were until I found out they were the ones who refurbed my system, I can definitely recommend Joy Systems to anybody who's cautious about getting a refurbished system.Funny. NewEgg doesn't allow you to mention Micro Center but I refuse to actually say how much better of an experience I had with this refurb from NewEgg/JoySystems than MC. They did it right the first time, and the first time is brings you to the second purchase and recommendations to others really.",2,0
DELL,E6430S,2,Not to happy from the start!,2017-02-15,"Pros:Dell Latitude is a great computer and are one of the main computers I purchase for my clients.  Solid state driver, 8gb ram, and intel i5 processor make for a great computer.  HOWEVER....",Cons:Opened up box and found a NON-OEM power supply.  Some off brand power supply which is okay but not since nothing said anything about that.  Turned on computer and found what looked like food crumbs all over keyboard and screen.  Keyboard was not working properly - meaning several keys I had to hit several times and push pretty hard for it to register.  Also found Windows 7 license not registered yet and tried to register but gave error code.  Computer should already be licensed if you ask me.  Also found extra junk on computer with a unknown antivirus and odd word processor.  Not to happy about this transaction.  Lets see if the next one that comes in will be different since I cant get my money back and have to trade in for another.  Not to reassuring so far. Also should note that bottom of computer would not sit flat and was missing its rubber bumpers so it rocked back and forth off balance.  Just a tad annoying!,"Other Thoughts:I would always recommend a business class laptop such as Dell Latitude!However, if I were refurbishing the computers and selling them windows would already be purchased and I would make sure the keyboard was tested.I'll update once replacement comes in to see if anything is different.",0,0
HP,2560P,4,Very Good Product,2016-07-25,Pros:Very good speed for the size with 16 GB Ram and the Intel i5 proccesor.  Plenty of hard drive space for my needs.  And most importantly it at a great price,Cons:Only problem I have had with it so far is that it does not have a HDMI port.  But It does have a Display Port which i can get an adapter to use a HDMI Port,"Other Thoughts:I would recommend this product, probably would buy it again only reason I say probably is because of no HDMI Port.  Quick speedy delivery also!",0,0
HP,8470P,5,"Awesome computer, A lot of performance for this price.",2017-09-10,"Pros:Everything on this machine is fast.... fast boot up time, etc..  The 1 TB drive is a bit larger than I actually need, but at this price, why not take the extra space and enjoy it!.","Cons:A slightly larger monitor would have been nice, but I knew what I was getting, and for this price, I am satisfied with the size of the screen. I also wish it had 1 or 2 more USB inputs, but I realize most laptops in this range do not have many inputs. Again, it's fine.","Other Thoughts:This computer looked like it had just left the factory. It's in perfect shape, no scratches or scuff marks. The Windows 10 Pro authentication went flawlessly (as it should). I am totally happy with this purchase.",0,0
Lenovo,ThinkPad T440s,5,Great Product,2018-12-20,Pros:Super cheap compared to other similar items and in perfect shape as well.  Extremely Satisfied!,Cons:Nothing,Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend purchasing an item from this seller.,0,0
HP,8570P,3,"Nice computer, but I am on my 3rd one",2017-05-27,"Pros:Fast, nice finish, durable, graphics card, overall nice laptop","Cons:Heavy and no backlit keyboard, but I knew this before purchasing","Other Thoughts:Overall experience with this purchase was not great. The first laptop I received had a bad fan, you could hear it rattling across the house. So, I contacted the third party company that Newegg sells these computers for. They told me I could return it to them for repair (the whole computer, they will not send out parts), but basically told me it would be easier if I sent it back through Neweggs return system, which was fine. But, they told me if I returned it through Newegg then I could get another computer before they received the broken one, which is NOT TRUE. But anyway, I sent that one back and once Newegg got it back and it was approved, I received another one. I got the new one in and the fan was also very loud on it, and the charging port was very loose, almost to the breaking point. I immediately boxed it back up and sent it back as well. So, a while later, I received the third one in the mail, which is the one I still have now. It works great, the only complaint I have on it is the hinges that open and closes the lid are a little loose. It Is not as solid as the previous two, but I did not want to send it back again. It also had stickers over the keys on the keyboard, but they were no problem to take off. The previous two laptops also had a genuine HP charger, which this one does not. Battery life is decent considering it is the original battery. I made the first purchase 2/2/17, and finally got this all resolved 3/21/17, when I received the third laptop, so this was a very long process.I knew this would be a refurbished laptop, but I expected things to play out a little better than they did. If the first laptop would have been good then I would have rated this 5 stars easy. I would recommend buying this laptop, just beware that you might get something that you will have to immediately send back. If you get one with no problems first try, then you have better luck than me!",0,0
DELL,E5450,5,Great deal in a refurbished laptop.,2018-07-21,Pros:Great deal in a refurbished laptop. Looks like it is brand new.,Cons:No cons thus far.,Other Thoughts:The laptop came via Joy Systems. very happy with them.,0,0
Lenovo,Thinkpad T450s,5,Love it,2019-03-22,"Pros:Looked  new, very clean.  Cortina made the set up process easy. The computer has all the advanced features a power user needs at a steep discount over new. Latest operating system.",Cons:None yet.,Other Thoughts:Have used nothing but Lenovo products as an engineer for the last 18 years and Newegg for 15 years. This is a top of the line professional machine. Very satisfied with Lenovo and Newegg.,0,0
DELL,E6440,2,Defective Peripherals - NOT HAPPY,2017-08-27,Pros:Quick Shipping,Cons:The video port did not work and one of the USP ports did not work  had to return - not happy. The computer was to have Blue Tooth but no blue tooth.,Other Thoughts:Help dest took a week to get in contact with. And I had to return the unit after I installed all of my applications. I had to remove all of the applications before returning the unit. Now I have to wait a week or so to get my computer and I'll have to spend a day or so reinstalling the applications.,0,0

HP,745 G2,4,Great Price - OK Results (Seems QC was amiss on this one),2017-08-22,Pros:- Great Price- Nearly new in look- Great specs for value- Easy setup,Cons:- There was a pile of drivers missing- Trackpad has several issues (right click doesn't work)- Delayed shipment,"Other Thoughts:Having been a Premier member for years, I generally only purchase items with the 2-Day Shipping tag. The machine (and some accessories) were ordered on a Thursday - all of the accessories arrived Friday - the machine didn't arrive until the following Wednesday (it didn't even ship until Tuesday), which is quite a concern since it shipped *FROM* the vendor.When it arrived, I loaded it up, put in the key and went to work - noticed a lot of issues of items not working by default. After checking Device Manager, quickly found that it was missing a ton of drivers. Went to HP to download and install them all.After all was said and done, the system works -- and great spec -- but I also have an issue with the right click on the trackpad. It just doesn't work. Updated the drivers, reset the device, etc........ Seems it missed a QC issue. *sigh*Overall, for the price (based on it's original MSRP), this is a great system. There's issues, sure, but it's totally worth the price.",0,0

HP,8460P,4,"HP Laptop EliteBook 8460P, A Great Deal at under $350",2017-01-27,"Pros:The laptop I received looked like it had never been used, not a single scratch on it and no dead pixels on the screen. It's loaded with 16G RAM and Win 10 Pro, it is a very good buy, with some caveats. Mine also has a 720p webcam, (specs said it did not have a web cam).","Cons:The windows install was not very good. When I first tried to boot up the laptop, it wouldn't boot. I had to allow it to reinstall Windows before it would boot. Then since Windows had been reinstalled, it would not accept the Windows software key and kept trying to get to go to the Windows store to buy a product key, after about another hour of research I found I needed to run all of the updates to be able to get the software key accepted by Windows. The updates themselves took hours to complete. finally, after about 6 hours of mucking with it, the key was accepted. Let me note, this is the first Win 10 machine I have had or even used. I hate what M$ has done in Win 10, first by wanting to know every aspect of your computing life and really pushing you to log in to a Windows account for your machine. And it really sucks that that is very difficult to reset the Windows default programs, especially the Web browser (Edge) and you can NOT delete Cortana, at least not without being a real programmer","Other Thoughts:The upside of all of this is that you CAN secure a Win 10 Pro machine, you CAN make your login local to the machine. It was a bit of a struggle. All totaled, to get booted, updated, registered and configured with basic programs I use, it took me about 12 hours. I would consider the laptop to be a 5 star machine now, but it would kind of tough to get it there. I've been working with Win computers for over 20 years now, if you are not reasonably proficient with computers, this may not be the machine for you. However, if you are good with computers, you could end up with a powerful workhorse computer for a relatively modest price. I wanted a Win 10 computer for a program that required the same, but I vastly prefer Win7 Pro in general. The bottom line, if you need / want a powerful Win 10 Pro machine, at a modest price and you are competent with computers, this is a deal I took one star off because how much work I had to do to get it set up to my liking, it could have been two stars off, but I'm very pleased how nice this machine is now (Win 10 notwithstanding).",1,1

Although it was a major hassle for me to complete this purchase, Joy Systems worked to make sure I was satisfied. I now recommend them for refurbished electronics.-----Joy Systems sent me a laptop with a defective mouse pad. Right button did not work. I sent it back for repair, which meant I might not be able to take it on the business trip I purchased it for. I asked for expedited return shipping so I could take it with me, but they said they couldn't do that even if I paid. I then asked if they could ship it to my business trip location and they took the address, but still sent it to my home address. Back home, I used it for a couple of times to just get it set up. Then the hard drive failed. While I usually buy refurbished, I won't buy one from Joy Systems again.",,0,0
