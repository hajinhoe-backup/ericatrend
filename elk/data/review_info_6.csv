DELL,E7440,4,Met my EXPECTATION! SPECS ON POINT !!!!,2018-01-26,"Pros:Laptop arrived on time!; laptop is in good condition. Keyboard and palmrest are in excellent condition.

DELL,D620,4,"bargain basic notebook/laptop, recommended!",2017-07-16,Pros:very pleased with NewEgg service and shipping; product is an off lease Dell but was clean and securely packed; has enough power to run Windows 10 (included) with 4GB RAM and even a DVD-RW usually missing from newer models.  A real bargain at less than CDN$200 INCLUDING all shipping and taxes.,"Cons:no local Toronto area pick-up was offered, but as shipping was only $1.99 via Purolator this was not a problem; there are slimmer and lighter models out there but they will cost you; the power supply has a very big and heavy transformer attached, so don't expect a lightweight package, but for business road warriors with a roller case it's just fine","Other Thoughts:recommended, four eggs out of five",0,0
DELL,D620,4,DELL Laptop Latitude D620 Intel Core Duo 1.66 GHz,2017-06-03,"Pros:Windows 10 32-Bit O/S is already installed. App's were easy to set up and install. Performance seems to be good when connected directly using the RJ45. Multitasks just fine.  For what I use it for it works for me. It's small, compact and takes up very little desk space.",Cons:When connected using WIFI it has a slight slower speed but not to bad. I presume depending on the strength of your WIFI Routing Device would make a difference as each device performs differently.,Other Thoughts:I would Recommend this Product.,0,0
HP,8560W,5,"Great product, fair price, on-time delivery!",2017-05-28,"Pros:This laptop is exactly as I expected/hoped for. Even though it's refurbished, it looks like new. Runs perfectly and it's fast (SSD drive, 8 GB of RAM and an i7 CPU).","Cons:I've had it for about 3 weeks and use it extensively and the only ""wish"" I have is that the battery life was longer (it's just over 3 hours), but with an i7 CPU, you're not going to get battery endurance much longer than that - it's a trade-off, speed for battery life.",Other Thoughts:This was a very good experience! I definitely recommend the product and Newegg!!,0,0
HP,8560W,5,"Much like past boyfriends, this comp. isn't much to look at, but it's pretty amazing otherwise.",2015-11-29,Pros:Super fast and I run multiple editing programs and animation programs.,Cons:It's not a diva machine for people who want to pretend like they're working on important things at Starbucks. It's a workhorse for people doing real work.,"Other Thoughts:I love this computer, maybe more than any I've owned. I'm a designer and my fianc√© has been a programmer for more than 20 years and he's pretty jealous of my new baby.",0,0

DELL,E6430,1,I love this computer BUT . . .,2018-07-28,Pros:I love the size and that the charger plugs in the back of the computer. Battery lasts quite a while. I also love Windows 7!,"Cons:I have just started to get a message that says ""This copy of Windows is not genuine."" I bought this computer because it is Windows 7 and I have some old software that I use with my business that will not work on Windows 10. Plus I hate Windows 10. I am doing a show in a week and I need this computer! I am afraid to update/restart this laptop in case it doesn't work. Hopefully it won't restart on its own. I will try restarting and updating it after my show and hopefully I can come back and give you a much better review!!!",Other Thoughts:Hopefully everything will work after the restart. At this time I can't recommend this laptop.,0,0
DELL,E6430,4,Nice system,2017-08-16,Pros:Clean system.

Lenovo,X240,3,Replacement Only Ploicy - Beware on the length of time it may take on the replacement,2017-02-23,Pros:- Decent refurbishing.  Appeared to be a new copy of Windows.- Seemingly a good product (based on reviews) at a good price.  Waiting for a functional piece to arrive.- Newegg willing to replace if the product turns up non-functional (Waiting to see if I receive good customer service).,"Cons:- Several keys on the keyboard did not work at all, preventing me from entering Windows license number. Returned for replacement.- After processing the RMA, received email indicating 7 to 10 business days to ""test"" the product before replacement is shipped.  The RMA itself took 1 week to reach Newegg (they only do FedEx Ground across the country).- Original shipping ~3-5 days, return: 7 days, return processing 10 business days ( = 14 days), replacement shipping ~3-5 days.  Adds up to 1 month to acquire the product if you end up in a situation where they failed to test before sending it out.",,2,0

DELL,E6420,3,"If you don't get a piece of cra p, is worth it.",2016-02-14,"Pros:You get what it says you'll get... A stupid fast, piece of machinery.","Cons:Don't ever pay to get it sooner, not worth it. On any refurbished, it will probably be broken, and you'll have to return it and wait the same or twice the amount of time that you would've waited if you didn't. So don't waste your money. Make sure to do the updates, the computer does them fast, but they are a lot!","Other Thoughts:In general is a great computer (if they don't sent you something broken and make you waste time and money, like they did with me), so when you get the one that is running great, you'll love it. It is stupid fast. Oh, and if your on the web, and its taking for ever, its not the computer, its your internet speed. Or it might need an update.",0,0
DELL,E6420,1,Doesn't work after 2 months of mild usage,2016-02-10,Pros:Are you kidding??,"Cons:You mean besides the fact that it plain doesn't work anymore after 2 months of using it less than once a week ??!!??!!Ok then it's bulky and not on the light side for a laptop that size.Had to manually re-install bluetooth drivers for the laptop to recognize any bluetooth device and that's when I realized that the company that refurbished the laptop didn't even care enough to re-install the original drivers provided by Dell. They just let Windows ""find"" all the devices which is a bit like ""crossing fingers it'll work and ship the beast"".",Other Thoughts:I have a 4.8lbs brick on my hands that I can't return because it's a refurbished piece of junk!,0,0
HP,8570W,1,Do Your Homework Before Buying!!,2016-09-23,Pros:Solid machine with minimal damage on the outside for a refurb..Everything worked to expectations!,"Cons:Received the computer mislabeled. Battery was not seated properly.After further inspection, the workstation did not meet manufacturer's (HP) details according to specs","Other Thoughts:I've been working in IT and on computers for over 2 decades. What I received did not meet what was advertised based on the original manufacturer. The specs are short on what they are suppose to be according to the manufacturer.Customer Support is great! Inspection team doesn't have a clue!! It's a refurb and I understand that part completely, but I have never purchased a refurb that did not meet original manufacturer's specs.. Newegg failed me this time!! Buyer Beware..",0,0

Lenovo,X220,1,Wrong product!,2016-11-04,Pros:I DONT LIKE IT!,Cons:I recieved one X230T with dirty keyboard ( I used much Alcohol to clean it before I tested it) and a battery with 80% health.It's not Refurbished laptop. It's just a used one!I've already applied for a replacement. Now I have to wait for another 1 month to get what I ordered.  And I deserve it?,"Other Thoughts:Anyway, I won't choose so-called 'Refurbished product' anymore. It's just a fancy word for used product.",0,1
Lenovo,X220,5,Fantastic!,2016-10-14,Pros:Expertly refurbishedIncredible value,Cons:None,Other Thoughts:I've purchased refurbished laptops for as long as I can remember.  This is without a doubt the most expertly refurbished laptop I've purchased to date.  You would never know it wasn't brand new.  I will definitely be buying more of these for the office!,0,0
Lenovo,T440,4,Great product for the price!,2018-03-01,"Pros:Solid machine. Easy to setup with Windows 10 Pro 64 bit pre-installed. Bought two of these for the office and they're exactly what we needed. Plenty of power, even for basic ArcGIS tasks if needed.","Cons:My only complaint was that one of the computers had a slightly sloppy trackpad button and loose plastic at the top of the screen. Doesn't affect functionality at all since we use a wireless mouse, but worth mentioning. It's a little clunky using the trackpad on the one computer.  Warranted one egg off the review since that suggests quality control on the refurbs being a little  sloppy.",Other Thoughts:I'd definitely recommend this computer for office tasks - SSD is quick and doesn't seem to hang on editing large files. May purchase another for the office to upgrade old hardware soon.,0,0
Lenovo,T440,4,"Great deal, slow shipping",2017-10-30,Pros:I'm pleased with the machine for the price. Batteries are in good shape. Seller was responsive to ship the charging adapter. The t440 screen is better than the t430. The machine is also lighter. Very nice machine for the price.,"Cons:The seller took nearly a week from receiving the order and shipping it. I understand slow ground shipment but a week from order to shipping? I ordered a x230 from a different refurb outfit and it came with a Win 10 license number which was handy when I added an SSD, not this one. Also they sent a Lenovo power supply with an adapter. The adapter wasn't in the box and they had to ship it separately. There was also a hole in the box where it could have escaped. In any case I had another power supply I could use while awaiting the adapter. If I hadn't I would have had to wait another 5 days to use the computer making the wait over 2 weeks from placing the order. When I called in with the problem the CSR was curious, prompt and helpful.",Other Thoughts:Overall I'm happy with the purchase but the hiccups puts them at 4 eggs rather than 5.,0,0
Lenovo,W540,3,Solid machine for the money ... it's just that touchpad?!?,2018-10-16,"Pros:- for the money, the performance of this machine is great. i actually liked it very much. it's a great performing laptop.","Cons:- needs a mouse. the touchpad is awful. Worst. Ever. Made. Period. the entire touchpad is a mouse button. also, with Windows 10 the driver makes the touchpad unusable. i could place my finger in the middle of the touchpad and the cursor would bounce vertically. it was simply unusable. i disabled all ""special"" actions from the touchpad and also used the ""basic touchpad"" setting that is available in Windows 10. i made the machine a dual boot and the touchpad worked perfectly fine with Linux. did i mention i hate the touchpad in Windows 10?",,0,0
Lenovo,W540,5,Huge upgrade!,2018-05-23,Pros:-Fantastic keyboard-Super fast boot time,Cons:-Rather short battery life,"Other Thoughts:There's a scuff on the bottom, other than that this is a brand new unit as far as I can tell. Would definitely buy again",1,0
HP,8570P,4,First time refurb buyer,2016-06-09,"Pros:Great specs, great price, low shipping cost",Cons:Tiny (65 watt) power supply.  Wasn't thoroughly cleaned.  Had coffee stains (I hope) between keys and some kind of schmutz near the hinge.  There are also these weird stickers on the keyboard keys.  Wasn't expecting that.  Must....resist...urge....to....peel...stickers.......,"Other Thoughts:I would buy again and recommend this based on specs.  Next time, I would like be pictures of the actual unit being purchased.",1,0
HP,8570P,4,This computer rocks!!!,2016-06-08,Pros:Received my computer sooner than exspected . Everthing works great on it. I am very satified with my purchase.,Cons:The only thing  that would make it better is a larger ssd.,,1,0
DELL,M3800,3,Not grade A,2019-01-15,Pros:functional and powerfulstill a deal buying something with this many features refurbished,Cons:had a dent on the lidkeypad had a gouge in itbattery was swellingwrong and missing screws in bottom plate,Other Thoughts:seller did replace the battery for me without any questionit really doesn't appear that joy systems actual value the work they do. for as expensive as this was i would not have expected screws to be colored with a sharpie in an attempt to match them. maybe I got a bad one but I would have considered this a Grade B,0,0
DELL,M3800,1,Defective,2018-04-16,"Pros:-Looks Nice, came as advertised","Cons:-keyboard, touchpad not in working order","Other Thoughts:The Laptop arrived in good condition. A few scratches on the case, but nothing you wouldn't expect from a refurbished product.Unfortunately,  the refurbisher obviously didn't try to do any actual product testing before shipping it. The keyboard is not functional. All the keys will type, but will not always register when pressed, leaving you with sentences that have 3-4 words missing.The touch pad is also not working the way it should. It is not really tracking smoothly, leaving you with a cursor that jumps as it moves across your screen.This is not what I would expect from a Grade A refurbished product. I will be hesitant to buy used from this website again. I've bought plenty of new products here without issue, so I'm dissapointed, especially considering this product is being sold directly from Newegg.I will update the review as I go through the RMA process.",3,0
DELL,E6230,5,So good I picked a second one up!,2019-01-21,"Pros:Good specs, the laptop runs well and the price point is worth if if you aren't going graphics or gaming heavy.The laptop itself is nicely compact with a comfortable weight (sometimes if a laptop is small and light it feels like a toy, which this one does not).The USB ports and HDMI capabilities are also a nice touch on a laptop of this price range.Refurbised well and no complaintsComfortable keyboard too",Cons:The material around the keyboard/mouse takes a little getting used to. The touchpad is basic but functional.Also the charger is a bit bulky - it's heavier than the laptop!,"Other Thoughts:I picked one up, got used to it, then had to buy a laptop for a friend - so I picked up this model again",0,0
DELL,E6230,4,Not an i7 as advertised but still great laptop,2016-10-02,Pros:SSD always a plus. Windows 10 Pro. Sturdy feel. Compact. Not a ton of bloatware. Single 4GB RAM stick allows RAM upgrade without having to toss two 2GB sticks. HDMI port makes is a great multimedia device.,Cons:Not an i7 as advertised.,"Other Thoughts:For the price, this machine really is pretty great and the display is vibrant and crisp despite its small screen.",0,0
Lenovo,ThinkPad T540p,1,Disappointed,2018-12-12,Pros:for being refurbished it looks nice,Cons:does not have the Nvidia GT 730 graphics like it stated in the description. most likely returning for a full refund.,"Other Thoughts:I'm most likely not ordering from new egg again.

It did not.  Had to return it.,"Other Thoughts:I like the products they advertise, but be sure what they advertise is actually in the spec or you will waste time like me.  Returned product.  They recevied it on Nov 7.  Awaiting refund still on Nov 11.",0,0

While this may seem suspiciously positive, it is in fact my real opinion. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, especially since I was upgrading from a 10+ yr old macbook that was running Ubuntu and who's battery would die immediately after being unplugged.",0,0
HP,640 G1,4,Solid computer for low price.,2017-09-22,Pros:- For a refurbished model this is pretty good. Computer looks like it's brand new.- No issues with hardware. Running well so far.- Performance is much faster than i expected.,Cons:- Speakers are kind of bad. Can't really blast any music from this. Need to buy external speakers.,Other Thoughts:- I would recommend this product to people who are just looking to upgrade their out of date model like I wise.

A good work machine, not so much for gaming. Love the 540 day warranty!

Then, it shut off for the first time. Both the drive and wifi lights were illuminated and the battery light was blinking. No idea what this means. I took out and put back the battery a few times and it started up again... Worked fine the next day, until I plugged it into power later. After turning it off, it won't turn on anymore. At all. One second of fan, and then the same light pattern. The lights will continue unless it's cut off from all power sources.Can't help but notice that I've got a 19.5v charger here, the laptop says it requires 19.5v, and the battery it came with is an 11.1v battery.

Lenovo,T430,5,Exactly What I wanted,2018-01-03,"Pros:Good Product at a good price.Boots windows and a handful of apps in about 10 seconds. Very quiet and capable, windows 10 functionality is good for a 10+ year old lap top. Very clean, with good keyboard and screen, DVD R+ optical drive in ultrabay, and no bloatware.","Cons:There is a vinyl wrap applied to the palmrest, touchpad and keys. The vinyl is sharp on the edges and makes typing less enjoyable.","Other Thoughts:Would recommend to anyone looking for a good value, entry level pc.You will need to download the creators updates and you may need to adjust the palm check sensitivity to get two finger scrolling on the touchpad to work well.",0,0

DELL,E7450,1,Bad Windows 10 Pro license,2018-07-24,Pros:Light weight and fast.,"Cons:Joy Computer refurbisher is not very good. We have problems with them before. Their support people know nothing about Windows 10 licensing.

DELL,E7450,5,"Stuck by Great Grandaughter, but.... It's growing on me the more I use it!",2018-03-31,"Pros:So far so good. Boots fast with an SSD drive and 64 bit Windows 10 Pro. I'm not a fan of Windows 10, but with this Laptop it's a lot easier to take. It's a very light and thin machine and the screen is very sharp and clear. No real issues even though it's a used machine. Great price for a well designed every day use Laptop.","Cons:Small Hard drive, but an External drive will solve that issue.","Other Thoughts:I bought this Dell E7450 for my Great Granddaughter to use for school work. I was hoping it would last her the next three years until she graduates High School. Her Dad bought her a brand new Mac Pro Book the day this arrived! Can't really return it, so I set it up for myself and the more I play with it the more I like it. I think I will get a Docking Station for it. It's fast and maybe over kill for some things, but I like I can pair it with my Echo Dots and my Samsung TV. I'm hoping it will last me now for a few years instead! It's playing my favorite radio station through my Echo Dot paired through Blue Tooth into my 7.1 surround system in my living room right now. Sounds terrific and no Burps yet. The Dot burps a lot trying to play this station and the tuner in the Sony Surround Amp is useless. So I'm happy right now.",0,0
DELL,E6330,5,Great deal & fast shipping,2016-02-13,"Pros:- For the 3 days I've had it, it's been a great computer- The 16 GB RAM & SSD make for a boot time of under 30 seconds","Cons:- One very small dent on the top cover, but as a refurb it's too be expected- No MS Office, but no HP bloatware either",,0,0
DELL,E6330,1,DUD,2015-08-21,"Pros:SSD & RAM, clean screen, does seem to work so far. Nothing wrong with this particular model - my neg comments have to do with the refurbishing.","Cons:Cheap OEM Supply, more wear than in pics, dirty inside, non-original keyboard with stickers on keys (and a little bent near track point), pet hair and dust sticking in keyboard, stains on inside palm rest, back housing missing a screw, obvious dust and dirt inside - was not clean, lot of scuffs and scratches exterior",Other Thoughts:This is not my idea of refurbished. Had much better luck with other refurbs bought at newegg in the past.,0,0

A good work machine, not so much for gaming. Love the 540 day warranty! Good value under $300","Cons:A bigger HD (like 1-2 Tb) would be nice, and an SSD would make it faster but I didn't want an SSD, so not a con for me",Other Thoughts:Have not tested the camera or the DVD burner and there is no software installed for the fingerprint reader,0,0
HP,8470P,2,Not terribly impressed,2017-02-11,"Pros:*  No preloaded garbage programs*  Very minor scratches, but it was refurbished*  Price","Cons:*  Needed 18 months of updates*  Very poor performing HDD, the HDD is worthless over 50% load and when executing anything, the HDD is at 100%*  Meh for processing power, nothing special, I have an i3 that runs better than this i5.","Other Thoughts:If you need a very basic laptop for a decent price, this might be for you.  That being said, I am underwhelmed.  I should have gone with the SSD.  I wouldn't recommend this laptop.",0,0
