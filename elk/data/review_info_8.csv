HP,15-da0050ca,4,Good price but skimps on everything but the CPU,2019-01-28,"Pros:Very speedyGood price for an i7 CPUOpen M.2 slot allows for easy storage upgrade (e.g., M.2 SSD)Included HD provides 1 TB of storage and is adequately fast (real-world transfer speeds of about 80MB/second)Included 8 GB of RAM is adequate, there is an open slot to add more if desired","Cons:""HD"" monitor is 1366 x 768 (so not full HD), and is passable, but overall pretty terrible (e.g. poor black levels and viewing angles)The included 1 TB mechanical hard drive is OK but is a major bottleneck on the fast CPU re: overall speed. Get an M.2 SSD and install it in the open slot for a major speed boost. But that of course adds $60-$120 of additional cost.","Other Thoughts:Recommended for those who know what they are getting (a great CPU) for the attractive price, and are comfortable with opening it up to install an M.2 SSD drive for a big speed boost.

Its on par with other top tier business class laptops, but it still hurts the pocket book.- The function key is where the Ctrl key should be. It is very confusing and seems trivial, but I cannot tell you how many times it has tripped me up mid work flow.","Other Thoughts:I figure I will drop my other review in here in case anyone wants the full scoop.To provide some context to this review. I am a software developer / BI analyst and work in a variety of environments ranging from my desk (2 - 24 inch dell 1080p monitors, DAS keyboard, mouse and a dell d6000 dock) to being on the move in meetings and around town. Prior to purchasing this computer I was using a late 2016 Macbook pro at work (I7, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD and 2GB gpu) and an Alienware m17 for personal and contract work (I7 6 series, 16BG DDR4 ram, 970m and a ssd). I purchased the Lenovo with the following - I7 8650, 16GB RAM, 512 SSD, 1440 px screen)I regularly use the following apps for work, most of the time with multiple apps open at the same time.-Visual Studio-SQL Server Management Studio-Tableau Desktop-Eclipse-MySQL WorkbenchAnd all the others running pretty much always-Office 365-Spotify-Slack-Discord-Putty -3 concurrent OneDrive sessionsThe first day I started using this laptop I had serious concerns. Once I had everything booted up and all the apps open and going there was some serious ""throttling"" occurring. It was a nightmare, as even the mouse would jump across the screen making the machine unusable. I decided before I would dive in and see what was happening I would update everything via Windows and the Lenovo Vantage software. There were several updates and after performing these this machine has performed like a dream. I am not sure if it was the updates or if it needed to be rebooted. I never had to look any further into it.It has put to bed all of my concerns, including small screen size, build quality, battery, and overall speed. I routinely have multiple extracts being performed in Tableau which maxes my RAM usage out while actively using SSMS or Visual Studio and it runs as smooth as glass. I downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2017 (all modules) and SQL Server Developer Edition while using Office and designing a dashboard in Tableau Desktop for ~2 hours and still had ~65-70% battery. The keyboard is one of the best I have used on a laptop. Lastly, going from a 4.5 lb Macbook pro to a 2.5 lb carbon, you would not expect it to make a huge difference, but it is simply amazing. The texture of the casing combined with the weight makes it a dream for people with portability in mind.At this price point you can choose pretty much any machine you want. The X1 is not perfect, but it is so close. If you have the money and use your computer for any duration during the week, you will not be disappointed with the X1. It is the best overall laptop I have ever used. It has been over a month and probably 265 hours worth of use and honestly every day that passes I enjoy this purchase just a little bit more.",4,0

MSI,PS42 8M-064,5,Nice Looking and Compact,2018-09-13,"Pros:The PS42 8RB-060 has an attractive metallic surface.  It's thin and light with a 14"" screen.  The display is clear.  It was easy to set up wireless and get started with Windows 10 Pro.  The keyboard is illuminated and comfortable to use.  The touch pad is easier to use than I expected.  There are two USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A and two 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C ports.  The HDMI port works well with my larger external monitor.  The fingerprint reader was easy to set up and works well.  It has a dedicated graphics card, the NVIDIA GeForce MX150.  The laptop runs quietly most of the time.  Best of all, it boots up very quickly.","Cons:The webcam is low down on the screen, which may not provide the best angle for capturing video.  However, the screen can be adjusted to correct this somewhat.  It's not that important to me because the webcam is functional.","Other Thoughts:So far, I am very pleased and would recommend this laptop.   The built in speaker audio is reasonable for a laptop, but external speakers or headphones will be a must for better audio.  There is no Ethernet port, but a USB Dongle comes in the box.  I haven't used it yet because the WiFi speeds have been fast enough.  I just connected a Bluetooth mouse, and it's working very well.  The documentation and support on the MSI website could be better in my opinion.  I did register my product online.  Of course I would have loved a Thunderbolt port, but for this price, I think the port selection is good.  Overall, I am glad I made this purchase.",3,0

,,5,"Perfect size & weight, packed with the best",2019-02-15,"Pros:First, the speed is INCREDIBLE! Downloaded all my programs and all was compatible. Between the SSD, the 32GB RAM, and the latest i7 processor, I literally could not ask for better performance or speed. One thing I wasn’t expecting was that it also has face recognition for logging in and passwords in addition to the newest fingerprint scanner if you’d prefer (or use both). First time using the Thunderbolt port for data transfer and backup, and again, the speed is off the charts and so far above my expectations. So happy I went this route.","Cons:If I had to pick something I didn’t like (thinking as I’m typing), I’d have to say...I’m honestly at a loss, there’s nothing that I do not like about this laptop.","Other Thoughts:I’d recommend this laptop to anyone looking for the best of everything. I intentionally did not opt for touch screen, or the convertible version due to the type of work I do and the features that worked best for me. Make sure you upgrade the RAM (32GB) when ordering, the speed is amazing, and I couldn’t have opted for a nicer more comfortable and high performance laptop.",0,0
MSI,PS42 8M-096CA,5,Dual booting Win/Ubuntu: I'm impressed,2019-03-18,"Pros:After returning a defective open box Zenbook, I decided to try this PS Series machine—my first MSI—and, though its been less than a week, I am impressed.I chose the UMA/integrated graphics version because I’m more concerned with battery life than FPS and because I wasn’t certain how well behaved the NVIDIA drivers would be under Linux (more on Ubuntu install below).It’s light and tiny, yet features a bunch of USB ports (including 2 USB Type-C) and a full-sized HDMI output.The combination of the i7 CPU and SSD make it very responsive. It boots up and launches applications  fast: about one second to launch chrome and kicad, two seconds to start up atom and libreoffice, bit longer for eclipse.  It's great to see compilation jobs just rush by.  Even under windows things are snappy. In short: fast.The is screen decently bright, very crisp and the matte finish looks good and does a great job of killing reflections.I’ve yet to be on the road long enough to really test the battery and don’t think it’ll provide for a full day’s work, but with the screen around 60% brightness and wifi it looks like it’ll last 6 or 7 hours.The keyboard is full sized, the back lighting is sweet and it's nice to use.  Trackpad is nicely positioned and works well.Finally, it's a beautiful little system and I like the distinctive brushed metal case.","Cons:There’s only one slot for RAM, and getting access to that slot for eventual upgrades will be a pain (it’s on the top of the board, under the keyboard, so there’s lots of taking apart to do).You won’t host a party around the built-in speakers… they do the job but in real life you’re better off using the bluetooth with headphones or something with more oomph.Only other “con” is that the laptop is light.  Super light.  So light, I still can’t tell if I actually put it in my bag and keep having moments of surprise/fear that I’ve left my box somewhere.","Other Thoughts:Short version: I would recommend this system.Some notes on getting Linux installed.I got Ubuntu running on it without much issue.  When you receive the system and complete the windows installation, the drive is split into 5 partitions.  Of most interest are C, D and a 900M recovery thing between them.There’s thankfully nothing at all on D, and windows allows you to shrink C somewhat.After the agonizingly slow process of creating a recovery USB drive, it asked if it could delete the hard drive recovery partition.  Yes please!  But: fail.Still, this little partition between the freed-up space on C and D can be safely be deleted by booting into Linux from USB or whatever.  You can use this opportunity to delete that D partition as well and now have a chunk of free space—I dedicated 305G of the SSD to Linux, left the rest to Windows which is plenty even with Visual Studio and a few other tools installed.The other main obstacle was UEFI.  Had to muck around, but it’s not that complex in the end.The main things to remember are:* Do your windows install* optionally shrink that C and get rid of the recovery partition, or just destroy the D partition to free up a decent amount of space without disturbing anything else* if installing Ubuntu, use the side-by-side installation procedure.  The “something else” manual mode wouldn’t let me associate the efi partition at the front of the drive so it would mount on /boot/efi but the automated process handled it fin* once installation is done, a reboot will just pop you straight into windows… uhm, where’s grub?For this, you have to get into the bios.  For the MSI boards, BIOS is accessed by pressing the *Delete* key right at the start, when you first see the pretty logo.  In the BIOS, hidden under boot somewhere,  is the UEFI boot order config.  After Ubuntu installation, there were two entries: windows and Ubuntu.  Windows was first and, since windows is a jerk, it won’t let you choose anything but itself.  Switch the order so Ubuntu is first, and now grub boots up, lets you choose between Ubuntu and Windows. Done.",0,0
Lenovo,G50-80 (80KR0015US),3,Good buy but fragile,2016-02-03,Pros:I did not buy this system from newegg but the exact same system from Microsoft's store.  I got this system as a general purpose system for my wife.  The system upgraded to Windows 10 without any issue.  Once booted the system ran pretty well.  It would take it a while to boot but that is not really surprising.  The Battery worked well as can be expected and the Intel 5500 Graphics did well even when my kids would play Minecraft on it.,Cons:The glide pad buttons were hard to push down.  If you hook up an external mouse this would not be an issue.The Wifi had issues out of the box but after upgrading the driver it seamed to do OK.The sound quality is what you would expect from a cheap notebook.  It works and does well with headphones but it is lacking on the built in speakers.System is fragile.,"Other Thoughts:The biggest issue is how fragile it is.  My wife dropped it from about 2 feet off the ground on to carpet and the casing broke and it became a desktop.  We still use this computer today but it is now a desktop with external, keyboard, mouse, monitor and speakers.Just in case you think ""What do you expect when you drop it?"" My wife had a Dell before this system and had dropped it from the same location +20 times and it never missed a beat.As long as you know the issues on this notebook and still want it for what it is this is a good buy.",4,2

Now the laptop is awesome, and I'm glad I kept it.  I would encourage Lenovo to seriously focus on improving their quality assurance processes and to not release new products until they have been tested!  Read the original review below as you might unwittingly have a laptop with the older BIOS.ORIGINAL REVIEW--------------------------I purchased this laptop from Lenovo.com on 8/7/18.  From the moment I received it, it does not handle fast typing. I couldn't even type my password correctly when setting up Windows for the first time. I type at an average 85 WPM and sometimes as much as 100 WPM.  The problem is that the keyboard often switches letters around when typing above 50 WPM or so. When typing the word ""computer,” for example, what comes out is ""cmoputre.”  It’s as if some keys have built-in lag while others do not.  I believe this is a serious, uncorrectable design flaw, not a defect of this unit.  Continue reading.I contacted Lenovo support immediately and asked for a refund, but of course they didn't listen and instead sent a box overnight for me to send in for repair. I gave it a shot. It was at the repair center for 2 weeks on ""technical hold"" presumably because they couldn't figure how to solve it or even reproduce it. I received the laptop after about 2 weeks and the service note said it was repaired for ""missing keys.""  Obviously that wasn't the case and neither did they fix the issue. I contacted technical support again via their chat service. After waiting on hold for 40 minutes, the guy told me to call software technical support without even troubleshooting the issue-- he probably just assumed I was an idiot who can't type and had a lot of work to do. After kindly persuading him this is not likely a software issue, he had the bright idea to plug in an external keyboard. As you would expect, typing on the external keyboard worked just fine. This proved the laptop’s built-in keyboard was at fault. He immediately sent out a replacement keyboard.Well, I just finished installing that replacement keyboard tonight and the problem is still not fixed. Hence my frustration.I went online to fill out yet another support ticket.  After writing a long note describing the problem, the support ticket would not submit and it conveniently lost everything I typed. I tried again and the same thing happened. What a shocker. I decided to start a refund ticket but the website will not let me proceed because I purchased the laptop more than 30 days ago.  I ordered the laptop on 8/7 and today is 9/7. What a terrible experience, Lenovo. Seriously.I believe this is a genuine design flaw, not an ordinary defective piece of hardware and I believe Lenovo will eventually have to issue a recall for this model—I mean what else could they possibly do to fix this problem?  I’d already read a review of a person  experiencing the same issue on his E585.  What are the chances of that?",0,0

I never had to look any further into it.It has put to bed all of my concerns, including small screen size, build quality, battery, and overall speed. I routinely have multiple extracts being performed in Tableau which maxes my RAM usage out while actively using SSMS or Visual Studio and it runs as smooth as glass. I downloaded and installed Visual Studio 2017 (all modules) and SQL Server Developer Edition while using Office and designing a dashboard in Tableau Desktop for ~2 hours and still had ~65-70% battery. The keyboard is one of the best I have used on a laptop. Lastly, going from a 4.5 lb Macbook pro to a 2.5 lb carbon, you would not expect it to make a huge difference, but it is simply amazing. The texture of the casing combined with the weight makes it a dream for people with portability in mind.At this price point you can choose pretty much any machine you want. The X1 is not perfect, but it is so close. If you have the money and use your computer for any duration during the week, you will not be disappointed with the X1. It is the best overall laptop I have ever used. It has been over a month and probably 265 hours worth of use and honestly every day that passes I enjoy this purchase just a little bit more.",4,0

,,5,"Perfect size & weight, packed with the best",2019-02-15,"Pros:First, the speed is INCREDIBLE! Downloaded all my programs and all was compatible. Between the SSD, the 32GB RAM, and the latest i7 processor, I literally could not ask for better performance or speed. One thing I wasn’t expecting was that it also has face recognition for logging in and passwords in addition to the newest fingerprint scanner if you’d prefer (or use both). First time using the Thunderbolt port for data transfer and backup, and again, the speed is off the charts and so far above my expectations. So happy I went this route.","Cons:If I had to pick something I didn’t like (thinking as I’m typing), I’d have to say...I’m honestly at a loss, there’s nothing that I do not like about this laptop.","Other Thoughts:I’d recommend this laptop to anyone looking for the best of everything. I intentionally did not opt for touch screen, or the convertible version due to the type of work I do and the features that worked best for me. Make sure you upgrade the RAM (32GB) when ordering, the speed is amazing, and I couldn’t have opted for a nicer more comfortable and high performance laptop.",0,0
