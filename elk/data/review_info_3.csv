DELL,i3542-3333BK,2,Too much bad to go with this one,2015-03-20,"Pros:Pretty cheap price, but comes with consquences","Cons:Feels cheap, junky plastic feels like it would shatter if dropped.I bought 10 for a client, 1 had to go back as an RMA, Dell tried to play games with me in support had to forcibly tell them to replace the entire thing instead of a specific component.Hard drive is pretty slow, laptop is fairly slow out of the box.If you throw an SSD in it, it would probably be much better, but get something that feels decent instead.The worst part about this laptop is the trackpad. No physical buttons and it double hits on every single one of these 10. Please if you buy this expect to get a mouse to tag along with it.  Or better yet, skip this thing all together.","Other Thoughts:It's a good price for an i3 with 4GB of Ram, but it's not worth it. There are tons of other laptops that will do the same job without all of the flaws for the same price.  Dell really skimped on this one. 1 of 10 DOA, flaws are consistent throughout the bunch of them.",0,0
DELL,i3542-3333BK,5,Absolutely beautiful laptop for its price,2014-12-30,"Pros:Price, build quality, and performance",Cons:NONE,"Other Thoughts:First of all, You get what you pay for.Dont expect for this laptop to blow you away.It has budget cheap HDD and RAM and CPU.However, Overall Performance is excellent for $300 laptop.($300 if you look around just a little)I work for GeekSquad at BBY and I have seen many of those laptops. If you are in tight budget, you HAVE to go with this.",1,0
DELL,i3542-3333BK,4,Good for the Price,2014-12-14,"Pros:Decent CPU, moderately expandable, crisp display (despite being low resolution), DVD burner, hinges seem solid, lightweight, decent keyboard, decent battery life (>4 hours when browsing Internet, writing documents).","Cons:Feels a bit flimsy, glossy sides (where the ports are, so easily scratched up), glossy display, speakers are pretty quiet, one RAM slot (instead of two), only has Fast Ethernet (but a USB 3.0 Gigabit adapter is fairly cheap if necessary).","Other Thoughts:My old Studio 1555 was starting to fall apart, so I knew I needed a new laptop.  After a few months of research, and a very tight budget (college student), I settled on this machine, and after two months of use, I can say that I'm happy with my choice.After buying this computer, I maxed out the RAM at 8 GB and installed a 240 GB Intel SSD (originally purchased for my Studio), and this machine is plenty fast for what I need it to do.It certainly isn't the best built laptop of all time and while I would have appreciated Gigabit Ethernet in this machine, I can certainly say that for the price I paid for it, it's a lot better than most other machines out there (when comparably priced machines are Pentiums or A6's at best).",2,0
DELL,i3542-3333BK,1,Hard Drive Faulty - Locks,2014-11-19,Pros:Price,Cons:I set the computer up and the hard drive was throttled at 100% almost the entire time it is on.  I put one of my extra hard drives in and now it works fine.  I would NOT recommend.,,0,3
DELL,i3542-3333BK,5,Good Laptop for the Money,2014-07-27,Pros:Good price for a mobile i5 CPU.  Decent size and quality screen.  Internal DVD/CD burner.  Fairly light weight.  Runs all normal applications just fine. It's a Dell.,Cons:Laptop chassis and keyboard have a cheap look and feel.  Kind of flimsy feeling.  It's slower than the expensive laptops.  Not a laptop for serious gamers or road warriors.  It's a Dell.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this for an upcoming trip to Europe.  I needed an inexpensive laptop for backing up photos on the trip, and also for casual use at home.  I wanted something more than a Celeron or low end AMD CPU with a CD burner.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  The price was great, and it's rather cheap look and feel was no more than I expected.  5 stars for completely meeting my expectations.",1,5
ASUS,UX433FA-XH54,3,Huge overheating problem,2019-03-07,"Pros:small, thin, lightweight and good screen","Cons:Overheated even when just using browsers and surfing the web. The thin bezzel on the bottom combined with small vents and not enough space for heat to disperse made this a disaster.Also, coil whine on the left side.",Other Thoughts:I wanted to love this laptop but I can't recommend it knowing its heating issue.,0,0
ASUS,UX433FA-XH54,5,Almost perfect laptop,2019-02-20,"Pros:Small, but solid, fast-screemer, nice feel to keyboard I like the number-pad.  This was bought for the wife who is a professional accountant.  She needed a computer that can backup big files to USB flash drives FAST.  I was getting 400+MBs through the USB-C ports using a C-A converter to a Corsair GTX 256GB flash drive.  The screen it excellent and bright.  I'm also surprised how cool this seems to stay.",Cons:Not a con but this would have been perfect if it could have had a touchscreen.  I looked for one but there was nothing with the USB3gen2 ports in the system.  I did find a 4K screen version with a touchscreen but she did want a 4K screen and didn't need the MX100 graphics included.,Other Thoughts:All her co-workers loved it.I had zero issue transferring and installing all her apps in this computer.,1,0
ASUS,UX433FA-XH54,4,Great performance and battery in small package with some annoyances,2019-02-03,Pros:- Light and compact (more compacted but slightly thicker than my ux31a zenbook)- Fast due to cpu and nvme ssd- 512GB nvme ssd (Intel ssd 1800 read/1500 write)- Battery performance is good. i can easily get 6hours of decent web browsing activity on YouTube and other tasks.- Solid build quality (doesnt feel it will break)- comes with the USB3.0 GB LAN adapter- ac wifi.,"Cons:- Trackpad is annoying to use!!!! compared to my ux31a and other laptops ive used, this trackpad is a total miss. there are time cursor would just jump in random directions while trying to click on something... so unacceptable. You better use a mouse with this laptop otherwise you will want to return it if this isnt the case.- coil whine or some electrical noise is coming from the left area of the laptop when doing some cpu intensive tasks... annoying (review on other site about this issue states his stopped doing this after 2months of use... hope that is true)- no thunderbolt 3 port ..- Not a touch screen given it is a glossy screen... i would have liked touch screen given this point- the laptop sleeve case uses velcro instead of a magnet. i prefer the magnet like my ux31a has on its sleeve.","Other Thoughts:- Not a Matte screen given it isnt even a touch screen....- the blue color is nice but it is a fingerprint magnet... my ux31a was silver so you could hardly tell any finger prints were on there.- something is odd with the screen. if you go from a dark screen (youtube in dark mode) and then move to a bright one (open windows explorer for example) the image on the while looks a little blurry or grey like...it eventually gets normal bur during that time you notice the screen brightness step-up every second. strange.- the power adapter should of had the plug prongs fold into itself... this one just does not have that ability, shame. i have to say though that it is smaller in size than my ux31a, but that one does have the prongs fold in, guess that is the trade off. oh well.- wish there were more color options, i would have preferred a black option other than the blue.- when i am connected to 2.4GHz wifi i tend to lose connectivity randomly. i have to disconnect and reconnect to get connectivity back. i could be the only one, but anyway to workaround this issue i just use ac (5GHz) wifi..N.B. if you need to update the bios, use the USB2.0 port on the right side of laptop, otherwise it will not be detected by Asus ez flash utility in the bios.",4,0
ASUS,UX433FA-XH54,5,Great machine ...,2019-01-14,Pros:- small- light weight- fast- I can game with it ... World of Tanks ... 70 FPS on low resolution with 10 ms ping times,"Cons:- it uses the M2 disk drive form factor, so not ""cut and dried"" to install larger disk",Other Thoughts:- would recommend,1,1
ASUS,UX433FA-XH54,5,"Thin, light, powerful laptop",2018-12-30,"Pros:This is an awesome laptop.  I knew it was thin and lightweight, but I was still surprised at just how thin it is.  The screen is superb, and I like that it is glassy as I am not fond of dull looking matte screens like my old laptop had.  The best part is the performance.  I was initially concerned about the low power Intel i7 1.8 GHz 4 core 8 thread processor because my 5.5-year-old ASUS laptop had an i7-3632QM 2.2 GHz 4 core 8 thread processor.  Because this newer 8th generation i7 CPU can crank out to 4.6 GHz on a single core when you need that extra power, it totally leaves my old laptop’s CPU (which I was pleased with) in the dust!  The wireless card is super great as well.  It stays connected to my AC1900 802.11ac router at the maximum speed of 866.7 Mbps and never fluctuates.  When I run a speed test of my 400 Mbps Internet connection I always get 400 Mbps or more download rate.","Cons:I must say the only thing I was missing from my perfect laptop wish list was that it comes with Windows 10 Home rather than Windows 10 Pro.  The laptop was not loaded down with bloatware and did not have a 10 GB or so recovery partition, so I resolved this issue quite quickly.  In Windows 10, I went to Settings > Update and Security > Activation and took the “upgrade your edition of Windows” option.   I clicked on the “go to the store” link, logged onto the Microsoft Store, put $100 on my credit card, clicked the install button, waited less than 5 minutes for a few files to load, and then rebooted into Windows 10 Pro.  I think $100 is a little pricey to likely “unlock” Pro features that already exist on the OS image, but it was extremely quick and cheaper than spending about $140 to purchase Windows 10 Pro OEM software or $200 for the Windows 10 Pro full version.","Other Thoughts:I would have liked two USB 3.1 type A ports instead of just one, but that is not a show stopper as I can connect a USB 3 hub if I need extra ports.  The USB type C port is USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps) which is a plus as most of the laptops I have looked at only have a USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) type C port.   I am not bothered by the slower USB 2.0 port on the right side because I like to use a wireless mouse, so I leave the receiver for that plugged in there.   I spent many hours searching for the perfect 14” laptop and this one truly fits the bill for me.  I would recommend this laptop to (non-gamer) power users like myself.",4,0
ASUS,R503U-RH21,3,Good if you get it for under $300,2014-01-07,"Pros:I. The 500GB HDD is a slower 5400rpm, but this does help with the small battery. I still get about 3 hours of good performance out of the battery, 4 hours if I use my SSD and power saving features.II. The Wi-Fi stays connected and the transfer rate has been solidly fast over WPA2-PSK. You might have to use the Wi-Fi ""shut-off"" trick in Windows 8.1, but that's entirely Microsoft's fault and not ASUS's.III.This laptop stays very cool, even without an SSD. They placed the air vent on the side, and the  laptop stays cool on cloth surfaces as long as the vent is unobstructed.IV. I know this thing sells for $350 usually, but I bought mine for $250 on sale. This is an excellent price for a new full-sized laptop with Windows. That having been said...I really wouldn't pay more than $299+tax for it.","Cons:I. The track-pad is very terrible. Even with the ASUS supplied software, it is way too sensitive to things which don't actually touch it. The buttons are part of the pad and not separated. You have to install software to disable it. PLEASE DO. I knew about the lousy track-pad before I bought it, and had already planned to use my Logitech M570 trackball instead. Do NOT depend on the trackpad for regular use. It stinks!II. The BIOS.. (none) it uses UEFI instead which CAN be accessed without loading *anything*. Here's how:1) Pull the battery2) Turn on the laptop3) continually tap the ESC key until you get to the boot screen, you can then choose to ""Enter Setup""In Setup, Enable EVERYTHING, specifically, go to the normally ignored 'Security' tab/menu, and while you don't have to enable any of the passwords (I wouldn't), you MUST enable every device listed. You must also enable PXE booting for the onboard NIC. Here's why.You won't get to choose a different boot device (like a CD or flash drive) if you don't. The UEFI likes to 'detect' different boot methods. So if you ever want to get rid of Windows 8, follow those instructions. Figuring out true  functionality through the setup menu is NOT intuitive. Maybe it made better sense in Chinese or Hokkien before the translator got a hold of it.III. This thing is *BIG*, WIIIDE, and HEAVY. And at 1366 x 768, the resolution always seems too small for working. Movies look pretty good in 1280x720, but not in 1920x1080. It's not the sturdiest thing in the world either.IV. The keyboard doesn't respond too well for fast touch-typists. You can change the setting, but you'll probably still have to spell check a lot.V. The speakers are so-so. Better with power than on battery obviously.VI. The speed is so-so overall, but you get what you pay for.VII. No Bluetooth or PCExpress Slot.BOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!Bad ASUS! Bad OEM!No treat for you!VIII. The DVD ""Writer"" is really more like a DVD-reader/CD-writer. I can't get this thing to write to any DVD recordable media. I have to use a USB external drive to write. And YES this SN-208DN model is one which is supposed to be able to write to DVD recordable media, and YES the drive has the latest firmware and drivers installed. Take my advice. Look for an  after-market HDD caddy designed to replace this drive (they *do* exist)IX. Buy a screen protector first thing. The screen lays down on top of the keyboard keys and will eventually, but quickly, scuff the screen. I have tried larger rubber feet, but then the screen flexes when packed.","Other Thoughts:I paid about $250+tax, and I'm still pretty satisfied with what I bought. It definitely helped that I already had the spare SSD and Windows 7 retail license to go with this laptop. It did work just fine with Windows 8 though. No major problems after 9 months of everyday use.",2,1
ASUS,R503U-RH21,2,Do I believe Rodel or Jeffrey?,2013-12-06,Pros:Rodel says the BIOS is boot accessible.,"Cons:Jeffery, on the other hand, says that BIOS is only accessible through Windows 8.","Other Thoughts:Rodel with ASUS Customer Loyalty meet Jeffrey, also with ASUS Customer Loyalty. Jeffrey meet Rodel.When you guys figure out what truly is up, how about getting back to us?  Thanks.",3,1
ASUS,R503U-RH21,1,False information from Asus?,2013-10-23,"Pros:Not sure yet, was planning to buy but I am getting conflicting information about the BIOS in this model.",Cons:After reading the previous review comment from Asus support that said the BIOS could not be accessed without Windows 8 I decided to call Asus to confirm this. The support rep I spoke with assured me that the BIOS on this model could be accessed on boot without needing to go through Windows 8. Who is telling the truth here?,Other Thoughts:Nothing angers me more than purchasing something based on pre-sales information then finding out that I was given incorrect information after the purchase. I hope someone from Asus will read this and provide the correct information regarding the BIOS in this model series.,0,3
ASUS,R503U-RH21,4,More power then expected,2013-02-25,"Pros:Speed, affordability, battery life.  All pros for hardware.","Cons:Windows 8, bloatware, Windows 8, and Windows 8.  All cons are software.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this laptop just to upgrade from my netbook, so I could have something to do homework and travel.  I wasn't looking for a desktop replacement; I have a real desktop beast for home use.  When I got it home, I did some re-configuring on it, cleaned the the bloatware off, and added a Win7 style shell.  I was surprised how fast it was.  So I loaded WoW to see if it could run that (I normally only play on desktop).  I was able to fly around Orgrimmar on medium graphics settings with little to no lag.  For a machine that I paid so little for, I am very impressed.It is unfortunate that this very capable machine gets poor reviews because the operating system is not as user friendly as its predecessors.  I am not an Asus fan boy, but I have never been disappointed by their products.",2,0
ASUS,R503U-RH21,1,Lousy BIOS,2012-12-14,Pros:Keeps papers from blowing away.,Cons:Win 8 refused to give a valid IP for the wired NIC. WinsockFix doesn't work on W8. Asus support was useless. Tried for hours to boot from a flash drive to install Linux Mint. Never managed it.,"Other Thoughts:Great laptop if you live somewhere windy & have trouble keeping your paperwork in nice, neat piles.",0,3
Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),4,Great machines but you do have to go a little further and upgrade components.,2018-10-03,"Pros:Once upgraded:- Fast, responsive, and stable- For an end-users computer this thing can take some damageUpgrade this machine to a SSD and at least 8GB of RAM and you've got an excellent machine. I've upgraded a dozen of these laptops and for the base price and the upgraded parts they still fall underneath $700, well worth it.",Cons:- Hardware that comes with is lackluster (HDD & 4GB RAM),Other Thoughts:Just upgrade to a SSD and another 4GB of RAM (total of 8GB) and you'll have a fantastic workhorse.,1,0
Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),1,Worst Laptop Ever,2018-09-18,Pros:Ports,"Cons:Something is wrong with this generation of laptop. We purchased 12 of them and they are simply too slow. The previous generation with the same specs is twice as fast. The issue is with the hard drive which sits at 100% usage constantly. We replaced the hard drives and all is well. Go for something else, unless you want to spend $125 extra per brand new laptop.",,3,1
Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),1,Terrible speed for the price,2018-09-06,Pros:I can get my chores done while I wait for Facebook to load.,"Cons:This machine is painfully slow at any price; paying $539 just twists the knife. It takes about 3 minutes to access the log-in screen from sleep, and an extra 10 min to open a browser. I'm very disappointed with this purchase.",,4,0
Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),4,Fantastic machine for everyday use,2018-08-27,Pros:built to last,"Cons:You should upgrade it, this will cost some money.","Other Thoughts:Contrary to the other review listed here, this is not a bad laptop at all.To address his concerns-1. ALL Core i3, i5, and i7  U series processors in laptops (until the newest stuff came out this year) were/are 2 core- 4 thread processors. They work just fine. The only differences between them is the clock speed and amount of cache you get.Word processing, spreadsheets, Matlab, all of the stuff you would likely be doing with this Thinkpad work just fine.2. Yes, it comes with a Yugo slow 5400 RPM drive. A new 256GB SSD costs $70 here on Newegg. Order one with the Thinkpad.3. Yes, the amount of RAM on this machine  insufficient. It is very easy to acquire and install more. Do like I did, buy 16GB worth of RAM and install it yourself.4. Why buy a cheaper thinkpad that needs an SSD and RAM upgrade? Because it is cheaper to buy it that way! This is exactly how I bought my E550 from Newegg.My advice to you, find the size you want with the screen and processor you want and buy the cheapest variant you can find with those parts. You cannot really upgrade the screen or processor.But you can always upgrade the battery, hard drive, and the RAM.I'll be honest, the base option screen is pretty bad. If you can swing it get one with the 1080 IPS panel. It is the ONLY thing I don't care for on my E550.The speakers won't win awards playing music, but they get loud enough to be heard in a conference room or for a class presentation and they are very clear.My E550 also has the fingerprint reader. I love having it. It is fast and works well.The TLDR here is you should understand that you are buying something that you need to upgrade, but that it costs less to buy this vs the same model that already has the upgrades. Thinkpads are fantastic. If you want a real laptop built for the real world, get a thinkpad. Almost everything else is just an expensive toy.",7,1
Lenovo,E580 (20KS003WUS),1,The Low Grade Hardware Renders it Essentially Useless,2018-08-21,Pros:It looks sort of nice,"Cons:Look closely at the specs of this laptop, its not your standard issue thinkpad. Its on sale for a reason. It's not obvious but it only has a TWO core processor which is almost always at near 50% capacity just sitting idle. The 4 gb or ram it comes with are not enough to do most things including browse the web, since modern versions of windows and browsers are relatively memory intensive. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the hard drive is incredibly slow and renders the entire laptop all but useless. I had a solid state drive handy and swapped it out so it could at least boot in under 5 minutes, but the processor and ram are still insufficient to make this laptop worth buying. It literally cannot run on modern software at speeds that are usable for day to day tasks. If you need something simple, look elsewhere.",,4,4

Wouldn't necessarily recommend for a gaming build, but for what it is, it's a fast, light machine, and perfect for getting work done. Opted for this model over the Vivobook S for superior engineering and construction, and it definitely has the look and feel of a laptop in which a great amount of thought and intentional design was invested.Pros way outweigh the (mostly cosmetic) cons.

Sometimes it bluetooths. Sometimes it doesn't.-Have to reboot every time you want to plug something into the aux jack or unplug something from the aux jack.-USB problems. Usually have to reboot after unplugging and reinserting a U2F key. Annoying because I have to use at least 4 or 5 different U2F keys per day.-Pretty much just have to reboot continuously. I probably went months without rebooting my K501UX.-At least it reboots quickly, because I have to reboot 20 times every day. I would go insane if it took more than 20 seconds.-Screen isn't great. It says that it is 1080p, but it doesn't look 1080p.-No immediate feedback when you turn it on. Like nothing lights up or anything immediately so you just have to sort of wonder if you held the key long enough.

Wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have to go through that 20 times a day...","Other Thoughts:We have been buying Asus laptops at our office for the last 3 or 4 years. This is the first purchase from them that I regret. My last Asus laptop (that I loved) was water damaged and I had to replace in a hurry to get back to work and didn't have a lot of time to shop. Dunno if I will buy another Asus laptop after this. Might try something else...BTW, I only used it for a few days before doing a reinstall / upgrade to win10 enterprise.

This is the first purchase from them that I regret. My last Asus laptop (that I loved) was water damaged and I had to replace in a hurry to get back to work and didn't have a lot of time to shop. Dunno if I will buy another Asus laptop after this. Might try something else...BTW, I only used it for a few days before doing a reinstall / upgrade to win10 enterprise.  Went to Asus and downloaded all the latest drivers. Had wonky problems before the re-rack and have the same wonky problems after. It's just mediocre hardware.",0,1

Tried it with both linux and windows, stock one that comes with it works fine and reads.No attachment for ethernet or adapter included","Other Thoughts:Positives outweigh the negatives.

Lenovo,81B1001GUS,5,Fantastic laptop for the price if you get it on sale.,2019-01-13,Pros:Ryzen! Excellent performance. Running Sysbench with all threads 100% and the laptop does not get loud neither does it get hot. Maybe ryzen is just really well optimized to calculate prime numbers? Either way impressive performance for a laptop.,Cons:Only two USB ports.The touchpad does not work with multiple Linux distros I have run on it (Ubuntu 18 and Parrotsec). Working on a fix but so far haven't got it to work.Have started a topic in the Lenovo forums for the touchpad issue here:https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-C-E-K-M-N-and-V-Series/V330-14ARR-touchpad-not-working-for-Linux-amd64/td-p/4328988And a more exhaustive discussion of touchpad issues to include further links at parrotsec forums:https://community.parrotsec.org/t/mouspad-not-working-lenovo-v330-14arr/5224,Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this product.,3,0

Hit F9 to optimize settings and F10 to save.This fixed it for me. The laptop works well.","Cons:All drivers were lost after Manufacturers BIOS update. You can't do anything aside from log into the computer.Edit: Overall I'm pleased with the functionality of the laptop but not the experience. I had to spend the first several hours of ownership troubleshooting issues. Even with most of them solved, the biggest Con for me is the fan. It cranks up often even when the CPU is lower than 20%. The computer is staying cool but the fan is annoying. Will update if I find a good fix.",Other Thoughts:Probably would not buy again... It was a good price... but I'm no longer confident in my own machine... Just waiting for the next problem.,1,1

Lenovo,81B1001GUS,1,"No network after upgrading the BIOS, not listed on Lenovo's website",2019-01-04,"Pros:- It seemed like it had a lot of potential, but now I better understand the price (see below).","Cons:- Used the preinstalled Lenovo software to upgrade the BIOS. After rebooting the network adapter no longer works, both WiFi and wired. Windows could not recognize the devices, and of course without networking no Internet to find some working driver.- Cannot find this product on Lenovo's website. Similar named ones are out there including an Intel based laptop, but no mention of this AMD based laptop.- For the couple hours I did run it before upgrading the BIOS I found the fan irritatingly noisy.","Other Thoughts:- If you are a hardcore AMD dude looking for a budget laptop you'll probably be able to keep this working and be satisfied.- For everyone else, just avoid it unless you like driver issues.",0,2

It does all of the low powered surfing activities I could ask for. My Google everything is synchronized with it. Google+ hangouts are phenomenal with this. I also, really like the convenience of a full keyboard that you don't get on a tablet (one of the reasons I got it). A note pertaining to the music streaming issues I had while surfing; this issue may have been due to slow WiFi in my residence.Overall, I love this machine. It's not a full laptop nor a tablet, but more a cushy in between area that solved the void in my technology.Full Desktop = High-Power ComputingLaptop = Portable High-Power ComputingChrome Book = Portable Low-Power ComputingTablet = Large Screen Portable SurfingPhone = Small Screen Portable Surfing + Telephony",1,0

I have a desktop that is very high end and I use it for all my gaming and everything else you can imagine.  I really just needed a machine I could make documents and spreadsheets on and keep all my more personal stuff organized with.  It may not have a whole lot of RAM or memory but it doesn't need it. You can store your stuff on google drive which is great. The Chrome OS is basically like the browser expanded into an entire operating system. Its simple and easy to use.

HP,8440P,4,Great Laptop,2015-09-04,Pros:I love the LED light that lights up the keyboard at night. The keyboard is easy to type on. The finger mouse in the middle of the keyboard is a great feature along with the alternative mouse buttons. The command center is convenient. It is very simple to raise or lower the volume or turn off all wireless communications for flight travel. It also has a fairly fast processor and plenty of storage on the SSD.,Cons:Not to pleased that this laptop doesn't have an HDMI output. It has a VGA display out and another type of display out that needs a special type of adapter. Because I got a refurbished model every now and again it won't wake up from sleep mode. The command center has two icons that blink and the computer doesn't respond. I usually have to do a hard off and reboot and it's good to go.,,1,0

DELL,E7240,5,"Excellent Bargain, Definitely Recommend",2018-02-02,"Pros:A much faster computer than anything new in the price range, the biggest factor being the SSD (Windows 10 boots MUCH quicker than with a standard HD). Lightweight but still has a reasonable screen size. No dings or blemishes -- basically looks like a new machine.","Cons:Doesn't make coffee, other than that no Cons.",,0,0
DELL,E7240,2,Not too bad,2017-06-27,Pros:- A decent laptop- Light weight and good battery life,"Cons:- It took three weeks to replace the defective laptop with a new one.- The replaced one has the same problem (The laptop screen is frozen when it is plugged  in, and it has two tiny spots on the screen).",Other Thoughts:I really wish that the description was more filled out so that I would have known the problems with the refurbished unit.

Great specs for the price.,"Cons:It is a little on the heavy/bulky side, but that I think that is expected, given the lower price compared to other laptops.","Other Thoughts:I purchased two for my office.  I was surprised that they were a little different - slightly different screens and keyboards, different power cords.  They both function well, but if you are looking for something truly uniform and exactly the same, they may not be if you are order more than one.  For our needs it was fine that they had slight differences.",0,0

DELL,E6440,5,Laptop works great,2018-06-17,Pros:- Windows is pre-installed- didn't have to worry much about that.- Out of the box it was ready to go. Battery was even charged.,Cons:- No cons outside of some hiccups that were really non-issues.,"Other Thoughts:At first I was a bit worried, because Windows 10 said it wasn't a legitimate copy, and attempting to reenter the key gave the same error, but it went away after Windows updated and seems to be fine. Really a non-issue. Another thing is that after cleaning the laptop surface with an alcohol pad it ate away some of the matte that's next to the mouse touch pad. My own fault for not checking if I should even use an alcohol pad to begin with. Otherwise, the laptop is perfect- runs great, great value, and as far as I can tell spyware free (no garbage preinstalled). Very pleased with this purchase!",0,0

Using headphones, the sound is fine.- no optical drive, no hdmi out","Other Thoughts:Calling this a scratch and dent made me a bit concerned with how this would look and work, but only the 'N' key has a mark on it; the rest of the machine looks pristine.  It's working great and the SSD is fast.  Except for the native sound, I'm very pleased.  But for the price, I had to give it 5 stars for value.  If I'd paid twice as much, I'd give it 4 stars.",1,0

Case had minor blemishes, but zero concern given the price!!Keyboard is full size and backlit, great to type on.",Cons:-No HDMI (not a deal breaker at all),Other Thoughts:-Great for students-great for Senior citizens-Great second computer for mobile.,1,0
HP,9480M,4,Bought as a gift for a student,2018-10-28,"Pros:Only loaded windows 10 to see if everything was working. So far so good. Will be a Christmas gift. Minor scratches on outside - nothing too bad. Design seems really nice. fairly responsive machine with windows 10 PRO. I had bought two Acers prior and now this one.  Acer has all the bells and whistles, 8th gen CPU, larger SSD, better graphics etc. but I actually prefer this one for design. More comfortable to work with and feels more solid. I like the way things are organized and the back-lit keyboard is great. It also has some sort of fingerprint scanner but I haven't played with that yet - it is a gift and it won't be MY fingerprint so I can't comment as to the ease or accuracy of that. Also has a track-point mouse which is nice.","Cons:Well, it is used and that is noticeable.  The screen/graphics are only average. It's a bit on the heavy side but depending on who you are, that could be a positive or negative. To me, I like the sturdy/heavier feel. Doesn't feel like it would break as easily. The backlit keyboard doesn't seem to stay on all the time, not sure how that really works.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend. Getting 8 gig, SSD, Win  pro 10, fingerprint scanner and a nice design from well know manufacturer for under 200 dollars is a good deal. Let's hope it has some staying power.",1,0
HP,9480M,4,An Excellent Compromise,2018-10-11,"Pros:- Solid performance for most things I need to do on the go, esp. once background apps are disabled. Surprisingly capable for its processor weight-class.- Price (for the record, I paid about the same for my previous travel laptop, which had FAR worse specs).- Overall design - slim case and comfortable keyboard/trackpad make it a breeze to use.- Ports make it compatible with a secondary monitor, among other things.","Cons:- Some minor dents (to be expected from a refurbished machine)- Capable as it is, it'd be a lot more impressive with a non-integrated graphics card.- Storage capacity is a bit on the low side; recommend augmenting with a high-capacity SD card or external hard drive.- Screen's relatively low-contrast, making it a pain for any art work - however, see pros.","Other Thoughts:I'd definitely recommend this device to anybody looking for a solid machine at a reasonable price point. Between its general performance and ease of use, I'm glad I decided to spring for this model instead of dropping the same cash on repairing my old travel laptop. If I were to change anything about it, it'd be that screen. It's fine for browsing, watching movies, writing, or whatever, but when it comes to sketching out concepts for artwork, the colors come through TERRIBLY. I'd read reviews before buying, but I'll be honest, they didn't prepare me for how messy it actually looks compared to my main workstation. If you've got another machine to fix things up before finalizing, though, or if you're not concerned about art or photo-adjustment to begin with, I'd say it's a steal for the price.",1,0
Lenovo,T430,1,Avoid Joy Systems At All Costs,2018-04-05,Pros:N/A,"Cons:Initially, I thought this was a good purchase. The battery life was around a couple hours -- low to my standards, but nonetheless up to industry standards -- to begin with and slowly deteriorated. Now, the computer will not hold any sort of charge even with it connected directly to a power outlet. I have been in contact with Joy Systems, the company that refurbished this computer,  but the customer service is sub-par at best, and the person I have been in contact with is seemingly un-knowledgeable about the issue at hand. My advice is to avoid Joy Systems in its entirety. The product has not compared to the money and time put into it, and the customer service received is absolutely horrendous.",,0,0

Poorly refurbished, half the function keys don't work. Had to install most of the drives myself. Even the dvd drive has some issues and does not work. It came with a replacement adapter (instead of a Lenovo), which makes me wonder about other parts as well. Battery drains out in less than an hour under balanced power management settings.",Other Thoughts:This is probably the first and last time I am buying a third party refurbished item.,0,0
Lenovo,T430,4,Solid Computer,2015-09-21,"Pros:Ordered this guy about 2 weeks ago and have been very pleased so far. This is my first time buying a refurbished computer so I was a little anxious as to what quality it would be in, but aesthetically it looks almost brand new, minus a few minor scuffs here and there. Bought it for ~$490 minus shipping which is a huge bargain for 16G RAM and 256 SSD. Will definitely consider buying refurbished from NewEgg in the future.","Cons:Not too many. Biggest complaint is the battery life, which is currently at about 1-2 hrs, though it seems like this is to be expected from refurbished laptops. New batteries for this model run at about $150 (as of Sept 2015), so even then you are saving a lot of money vs buying a new model with the same specs. The power cord was a little warn but it works just the same. The power cord input on the computer is located in the back which is a little annoying to me, though that is just personal preference.",,0,0

I bought it for my 6 year old to play games on and it's perfect for that task.  It's built like a tank, has plenty of horsepower to do what we need it to do, and I purchased the protection plan (he's 6 after all) so we're covered if anything should go wrong.",1,0

HP,8570W,5,Speedy and afforable laptop,2017-10-06,"Pros:I bought 5 of these laptops for a team event and have had them for over 30 days. All are working very well. Very fast laptops with a high end CPU. The SSD drive is fast, booting Windows 10 in seconds. The price performance is excellent!!  Battery life is good given the high performance CPU specs. Even though the units are B-grade refurbs, they came in very clean with minor signs of wear. I returned one of the laptop battery chargers because it was intermittently charging the laptop. Newegg support was OUTSTANDING and shipped the replacement charger same day. Would buy this particular laptop again in a heartbeat.","Cons:The laptop is a bit heavy, coming in around 6.6lbs.

Replacement has a battery that won't charge past 6% and is ""Near the End of its life"" according to the system.","Other Thoughts:I like the computer itself quite a lot.  Once I replace the battery, which doesn't charge past 6%, I'll have a great little laptop. I can't recommend purchasing one through Newegg, though, because there appears to be little or no quality control. Even the replacement laptop for the one with the unusably bad display has a couple of dead pixels, and the battery is so old I can't use my portable computer unless it's plugged in, which rather defeats the purpose of a laptop, doesn't it?",0,0
DELL,E7250,5,Outstanding Deal,2018-04-18,"Pros:Very happy with this laptop. Quick shipping, arrived in 2 days. I'm not sure what makes this a B Grade, but it looks practically new to me.

Quality-wise, this laptop is certainly worth its money. I'm also very pleased with the no hassle holiday returns (returns and exchanges all extended for another month).","Cons:Compensation for customers who have issues with the laptop could be better. For example, have priority shipping back to the company, instead of a regular shipping that takes 7-10 days.","Other Thoughts:I had called in to request a replacement. The representative was certainly apologetic, but does nothing special aside from 17 WHOLE DAYS days of processing for replacement! After paying $350 for a refurb laptop, I am having to wait almost a month to have a working one without cracks! I'm hopeful that my next laptop comes in without issues.

HP,8440P,4,Great Laptop,2015-09-04,Pros:I love the LED light that lights up the keyboard at night. The keyboard is easy to type on. The finger mouse in the middle of the keyboard is a great feature along with the alternative mouse buttons. The command center is convenient. It is very simple to raise or lower the volume or turn off all wireless communications for flight travel. It also has a fairly fast processor and plenty of storage on the SSD.,Cons:Not to pleased that this laptop doesn't have an HDMI output. It has a VGA display out and another type of display out that needs a special type of adapter. Because I got a refurbished model every now and again it won't wake up from sleep mode. The command center has two icons that blink and the computer doesn't respond. I usually have to do a hard off and reboot and it's good to go.,,1,0

It came with an updated version of Windows 8.1, so remaining updates went pretty quick. It was used to replace a desktop so the larger screen is nice.","Cons:The plastic around touchpad and keyboard have a cheap feel, but it's being used with external keyboard/mouse, so doesn't bother me. It's relatively slow for a newer model laptop, seemingly the processing power and hard drive speed combine to make it a non multi-tasker. It's not unbearable and was kind of expected in this price range, so maybe not a real con.",Other Thoughts:Ordering a solid state drive for it should give it the pep it's lacking.

DELL,i5748-1143sLV,4,Good value,2014-11-16,Pros:I was looking to replace an old 17 inch laptop for the voluntary organization (SCORE) supporting small businesses. I provide IT and Technology support and this fit the bill on price and features. The laptop will be used by several different volunteer councilor/mentors for text entry to a website data base so I did not need a touch screen and a big hard drive.

ASUS,S15 S510UA,5,Great for software development and everyday use,2018-06-10,"Pros:- Sleek, Macbook-like design- Back-lit keyboard with adjustable brightness- Powerful quad-core i5 processor- 6-7 hour battery life- Very lightweight and easy to stick in a backpack- Beautiful, bright, 1080p screen","Cons:This version comes with a 1TB 5400 RPM hard drive which can be painfully slow if Windows 10 decides it needs to update. This can sometimes bring the laptop to a halt. To remedy this, I ended up purchasing an M.2 SSD and reinstalling Windows on that instead. During installation of the SSD, I noticed that there were no extra screws included for mounting the SSD, and the SSD I purchased didn't come with one. I ended up taking a screw from the hard drive since it's squeezed so tightly in the casing anyway. It would have been nice to have an extra screw included.Additionally, on occasion, pressing the same key twice in rapid succession results in the key press only being registered once. For example, pressing the O key twice quickly will result in only one O in a text box. This can be a little annoying but it doesn't happen enough to be a real bother.","Other Thoughts:I have used this laptop for resource-heavy software development workflows, such as running a MAMP server and writing code in an IDE at the same time, or developing Android apps in Android Studio and running the Android emulator simultaneously, and the laptop never skips a beat.I have seen people complain about the keyboard being too flexible during typing. While I do agree that it does flex to some degree during typing (mostly around the middle of the keyboard), I don't use much pressure when typing, so it's not something that I even noticed until I saw people commenting about it. Considering the low price point for this laptop, you can't exactly expect the keyboard to be made of military grade aluminum.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase, and I consider this to be a steal of a deal. Other laptops at this price point don't even come close to this thing in terms of performance.",1,0
Lenovo,Flex 15 (59385700),2,NO USB boot capability!,2018-02-18,"Pros:Nice laptop overall, very fast boot up, nice keyboard buttons, a good solid feeling laptop.","Cons:This laptop does NOT have the capability of booting from USB drive (I tried 6 different brands/sizes, and 4 different OS's), and to my amazement, the Lenovo support not only did not comprehend the problem, but could not understand why anyone would want to boot from a USB, even after it was explained in detail. Lack of USB support is a deal killer for me (I am an advanced PC tech myself). Lenovo support has the WORST and most technically ignorant staff ever! NO computer technical knowledge at all, unless you want to pay $69 for their next level ""advanced technical support"". The only other gripe would be the power button is on the right side instead of the top face, so the button can get pressed accidentally.","Other Thoughts:Bottom line.... if they can't support the product you sell, then you are buying a brick without any warranty.

Lenovo,Flex 15 (59385700),4,"Great Deal, Very Happy",2014-07-07,Pros:The laptop is great so far.  Portability is amazing with how thin the unit is and the battery life is great ~6 hours of use.  The hinge system seems pretty stout and the computer functions as I had hoped.,"Cons:The battery alignment was off and took a little persuasion to get it to work the first time.

Lenovo,Flex 15 (59385700),1,Lacks standard function,2014-06-27,Pros:Basically a good maching.  See cons.,"Cons:Lenovo has the bios set up so that it is meaningless to do an image backup of the root drive.  It will back up, but when one boots from the usb port, the hard drive is invisible, so a restore is not possible.  The only only thing I get from Lenovo support is to use the built in restore - which will only restore to the original state, sans any software one has installed.  Or one can send it back to them, to get the same original restore, which means money and time after the warranty period.This is very standard, and basic, functionality to be lacking.  I would never have purchased this had I realized this was the situation.",,0,2
Lenovo,Flex 15 (59385700),2,DOA,2014-06-20,Pros:The outside of the computer looks great.,Cons:The computer would not power on out of the box. Lenovo said to send it back. Hoping they send me a functioning laptop next time.,Other Thoughts:Pretty lame that Lenovo can't put a working computer in the box and sticks me with the pain of returning it and waiting another 10 days to get a new one.

Lenovo,Flex 15 (59387570),3,Not Too Bad,2013-12-29,"Pros:No real complaints.  It's a decent hybrid suitable for my kids, I bought two and they are digging them.  It's very light and thin.  The screen is responsive and the keyboard is nice. I think it's pretty well constructed with a nice rubberized feel.  My daughters love the face recognition, they sit down and the machine unlocks.  The battery life seems to be pretty decent so far with my daughters playing minecraft on multi-hour road trips to visit family for the holidays.","Cons:I think for the price it should at least have a higher resolution (maybe 1080p, certainly doesn't have to be that of the Yoga 2 which is nearly 4k realm).  I understand missing the optical drive to keep it thin, fair enough, not going to knock and I knew that when I purchased it.  One other thing is the reverse of the Function keys, I have to press FN to activate the F-keys.  Not sure how I feel about that and I may find the keyboard app to switch it since my youngest constantly puts her machine in airplane mode since it's next to the volume.  One last item is the keyboard needs backlit.  I think it should be standard on all laptops anymore.","Other Thoughts:I've read multiple reviews knocking the Flex over the screen being too dark.  It's not the laptop's fault, it's Windows 8 with adaptive display (Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\Edit Plan Settings > Change advanced power settings + Display + Enable adaptive brightness > Off & Off!!).  I figured this out with my HP EliteBook nearly giving me epileptic seizures as the light in my cube was behind me and I would create shadows causing my machine to fade in and out constantly - freak'n annoying!!  Well, it REALLY affects the Flex and forces it to practically stay dark most of the time - just turn it off!!",1,1
Lenovo,Flex 15 (59387570),4,,2013-12-29,"Pros:lightweight, thin, well built, powerful, good looking, fast, usb 3.0, hdmi output, good price","Cons:windows 8, very slight keyboard flex on left side, the whole thing is a fingerprint magnet","Other Thoughts:I love this laptop! the pros far outweight the cons. It boots from a cold start into windows in about 15 seconds with the sshd (part ssd part hdd). It runs everything I throw at it including solidworks and inventor professional 2014 without any issues. The low clock speed on the cpu had me concerned, but it will turbo up to 2.6ghz and runs at that without any issues. It does get a bit warm at the vents on the left side, but nothing crazy hot.  The touch screen is a cool feature and I actually found myself using it a lot more than I expected to. If you want windows 7 I highly recommend upgrading to 8.1 (free upgrade) and then installing start is back.  Initially I had issues with typing and using the trackpad because I was not expecting there to be a full number pad on the keyboard. But I was able to adjust to it after a few hours of use.",0,0
DELL,i3543-3750BLK,4,Great,2015-09-13,Pros:FastReliableBig screenNumber pad is very helpful,Cons:The only reason I had to give it a 4 out of 5 is that the speakers are awful on this computer. For the price and being a dell I was shocked when I first listened to music on this Laptop. My older dell laptop had to stay below the 50 volume level because anything above that would be insanely loud. That was the only con (in my opinion) of this computer.,Other Thoughts:Overall an extremely nice piece of technology for the price.,1,0

They say its a software issue and of course that isn't on warranty. So they wanted me to pay $240.00 for 1 year software warranty. That's more than half of the computer cost.

ASUS,F441BA-DS95,4,Decent Budget Laptop but Far From Perfect,2019-02-20,"Pros:- 1080p on a 14"" screen is just right for a budget laptop.- 256GB Solid State Drive makes for plenty of space and, mostly, a fast responsive laptop.- 8GB memory is definitely the sweet spot for Windows 10.- The AMD graphics card in this laptop allows for some very light gaming.  Don't expect to be able to run games at 1080p with max settings, but it gets the job done quite well on older titles or newer ones minus a lot, and I do mean A LOT, of the eye candy!- The CPU is also AMD and, just like the video card, gets the job done.   To remain fair and objective, this is a budget laptop so I was not expecting high end parts here.- Very light.  This laptop comes in under 4 pounds primarily due to the plastic casing.  This is a double edged sword as one of my biggest cons is how fragile this things feels.- Keyboard is perfect minus the right shift key.  It's responsive, perfectly sized, and makes for easy typing.  However, the right shift key is slightly smaller than normal which makes for the occasional mistype.","Cons:- Battery life is trash, even for a budget laptop.  I found myself averaging less than 3 hours of battery life with moderate use.  If you were solely using it for web browsing this shouldn't be an issue.  If you plan on any heavy use (i.e. gaming), make sure you have the charger readily available.- As pointed out above the laptop is very light due to the plastic casing.  Would I trust a responsible adult with this thing?  Sure.  Would I let my kids use it?   Absolutely not; I'd honestly be surprised if it made it through the week without a crack.- The wireless is 2.4Ghz only.  Even in a budget laptop this erks me a bit.- Pre-loaded with apps you don't want and, in my case, was quite behind on Windows updates.  I spent the better part of the first 2-3 hours removing the bloat and running Windows updates.  If this is not something you're willing to spend the time doing you either have to deal with the clutter or look elsewhere.- Despite the SSD, the laptop can and will get sluggish at times if you're doing more than one task a time.","Other Thoughts:So, here's the deal:This is not a bad laptop.It's also not a great laptop.It's not a slow laptop.It's also not a fast laptop.It is about as mediocre as you can get.Depending on your budget I would personally spend a tiny bit more for a laptop with slightly ""better/faster"" parts.  Overall I'm not impressed despite the price point.  However...  to remain objective I have to review this based on what was offered vs what you're getting.  And Asus did deliver here.  Despite a 4 out of 5 egg review, I wouldn't recommend going with this particular model unless it hits all your check boxes and you're ok with the cons I listed above.",0,0
ASUS,F441BA-DS95,4,Budget laptop that will do what you need in most circumstances.,2019-02-07,"Pros:- 14"" screen is the sweet spot for most people.  Not too small, not too big.- 1080P resolution is just right for the 14"" screen.  I didn't have to change the scaling options because things were too small or too big like fonts.- It has a USB type-C port!- Solid state drive in a budget laptop like this is great.  That's usually the biggest performance upgrade you can make in a budget laptop, but this one comes with it already.- The RAM is user-upgradeable.  I was able to add an additional 8GB of RAM.- For a budget laptop, the shell is surprisingly sturdy.  I wasn't able to flex it much.- The CPU and GPU perform decently well.  I was able to play Diablo III with graphics settings set to medium levels and the frame-rates kept up staying close to 30fps.- Has an empty drive-bay where a CD/DVD drive would go.  Can be fitted with a CD / DVD drive OR an extra hard drive / solid-state drive.","Cons:- The shell is plastic, not metal like higher-end laptops.  Then again, this IS a budget laptop.- Wifi card is only capable of connecting to 2.4GHz networks.  I wasn't able to check if the card is upgradeable.- It's a little heavier than more premium laptops, but again this is a budget laptop.- The webcam's image quality is a little sub-par.  Its image is kind of grainy under most lighting conditions.- It doesn't have any biometric authentication for Windows Hello (no fingerprint reader or IR camera).- Battery life is kind of short.  I charged it to 100%, set the performance slider in Windows to maximum performance and ran Windows Update.  It lasted a little less than 4 hours.- The fan noise was audible when I tried playing games on it (Diablo III which is an older game seemed to tax its CPU and GPU).- The keyboard is not backlit.","Other Thoughts:Overall if what you need is a budget laptop, this one fits the bill nicely.  It'll let you run your average work applications.  I was able to run MS Outlook 2016, Word 2016, Excel 2016, Firefox with a number of tabs open and games all simultaneously and still got respectable performance with all of that running.  The laptop is fairly rugged.  It's thick and plasticky and was able to withstand being thrown in a backpack and taken with me during my work commutes, to the gym, etc. for two weeks.  After the two week period, it still looked like new.  I'm sure if you tried to, you could warp the case or cause it to crack in a couple of places (around the screen hinges and some of the ports).If all you're looking for is a daily work laptop that can also be used for some media consumption, this one does just fine.  It's not the slimmest or highest-end model out there and it annoyingly doesn't have a fingerprint reader or IR camera for Windows Hello, but for the price you get something that will let you do the basics and then some.",0,0
ASUS,F441BA-DS95,4,"Good budget laptop for productivity, browsing, streaming, photo editing, e-mail.",2019-01-31,"Pros:Good laptop in the 14 inch budget class ($4xx price range). Best for portability, office work, document generation, and media consumption with a shock-immune SSD. This is a better option (at a cheaper price) than an ipad with keyboard for getting work done - especially if you do your work in the Windows world. This is definitely not a do-everything or gaming or video-editing machine. ASUS has a lot of other models in their VivoBook series for that kind of thing.After going through the Windows 10 setup with Cortana there was 212 GB free on the SSD. 24.3 GB was used for the OS and all the included applications. There is some bloatware that is easily removed. I’m ok with uninstalling stuff if it saves me some $$$ in purchase price.HIGH POINTS:USB C port. (It is not used for charging the laptop.)Good keyboard. The action feels good (2.4 mm travel) and the keys are properly spaced (I find 13 inch laptop keyboards to be cramped and 15 inch laptops to have too much key spacing). Laptops of this size do not have numeric keys. There is some flex to the keyboard if you bottom out the keys.Trackpad. The trackpad is large, centered, and doesn’t get accidentally activated when you type. It is definitely usable if you don’t have an external mouse available. The handy new Windows 10 gestures are supported. Read about them if the idea is new to you.Screen is FHD (1920 x 1080).Adequate ports. Besides the USB C, the other ports are HDMI, VGA, headphone, Ethernet, USB 2.0 and 3.0 on left; SD slot front, round power plug. The power supply is a small square only about ½ inch bigger than an ipad charger and it plugs directly into the wall.Speakers are OK for a medium sized room.In a quiet room I can hear the fan, it is not too loud and is about the same noise level as a spinning 3.5 hard drive.From completely powered down, the boot time from ASUS splash screen to Win 10 login is about 15 seconds. After OS installation and 1st power-down , I was very concerned that I got a completely black screen for about 5 minutes after login before the desktop appeared. This is normal as everything first updates but it would be nice to know or see an indication. Think this is a Win 10 thing. The next time it just took about 3 seconds from login to desktop.I have noticed some reports of random speaker noise. I did not experience this.The battery life is around 3-6 hours depending on what you are doing. Battery is 36WHrs.","Cons:Why this doesn’t cost $800:Everything that’s not required for its primary mission (typing, viewing, editing, and transferring content while mobile) has been nixed.Plastic construction. Reasonably attractive, with a brushed, dark brown lid. Some people equate heft with quality. to those people it might fee ""cheap"" because it is so light in relation to its size.  With no spinning hard drive, DVD drive, or metal case, this is a very light laptop - under 4 lbs, which is OK except for some keyboard flex if you type hard.No dedicated graphics. The dual-core Stoney Ridge A9-9425 chip has onboard Radeon R5 which uses some of the 8 G of ram. It is fast enough for the primary mission. Don't expect i-7 speeds and high level gaming.Thicker than a “premium” laptop. - It’s about an inch thick.The (Realtek) wireless only works on 2.4 G. There is no 5 G. The wireless is N. The Ethernet is 100 Mbps. Bluetooth support is present.","Other Thoughts:Don't expect this to do everything. It is a good laptop for typing, internet surfing, email, youtube, and checking your SLR images on a photoshoot. The SSD makes it shock resistant. The price is sufficiently low that if you break it or bang it up while traveling, it won't be a tragedy.",0,0

Lenovo,81D20002US,1,Do not buy!,2018-11-29,Pros:- Really not much to speak of. At least it was relatively cheap?,"Cons:- Mouse trackpad and display have a lot of play- You MUST use the installation of Windows that it ships with. After a fresh install, only a few drivers would install properly. Notably, the trackpad would not work; driver installed automatically via Windows Update were broken and the driver on the Lenovo website would not install at all.- Lenovo made an incredibly dumb design choice to deliberately leave the F-keys on their function mode. In order to use the F-keys normally, you NEED to use the Fn button (ie instead of Alt-F4, you must use Fn-Alt-F4).","Other Thoughts:RMA was submitted and I would not recommend this laptop to anyone.

Once is had it one for a couple of hours the screen went all pixelated and made a screeching noise out of the speakers. Completely frozen you had two options, wait 2-3 mins for it to shut down and boot itself or press and hold the power button to hard shut it down. this would loose any and all things i am working on and even corrupted the operating system and i had to do a system refresh because it did it when something was being installed. This may have been covered had i used it and noticed it after first getting it but i didn't need it for a couple of months.  Also when it is on it smells like burning plastic and gave my classmate a head ache as the little fan blew it right at him all class. All in all it was part my fault because i didnt use it in the time frame to return it but i will still never buy refurbished again.  Just get a new one it saves you money because you wont have to buy another one in a few months. If you still dont listen to this at least make sure you use it heavily in the first couple weeks to make sure its in good working condition out of the box. (also want to make the point that its always on a hard surface/ vented because as many people have tried to tell me that that is the issue) (others have also said it was the video card or overheating but i have monitored the temp and updated the video card and it did not help. I will be replacing the memory next to see if this helps)",0,0
Lenovo,T530,4,Best Deal for the money,2017-06-07,Pros:The specs on these laptops are great for the money.  I have been purchasing these laptops for use in the company I work for.I have approximately 40 of these in the organization now and they have all worked well.  I have downgraded about half of these to Windows 7 Pro and they work just as good with 7 as they do with 10.,"Cons:Cheesy looking stickers on the keyboards.  For some reason whoever refurbishes these laptops puts stickers on the keyboard keys and sometimes the palm rests and touchpad.The stickers peel off fairly easily, but it is time consuming to remove this so called enhancement to the laptop.  Over half of the computers purchased came with these stickers on them.Most of the computers come with an aftermarket power adapter.  I have had one of them fail, but the warranty company has been really good to work with for replacements.I have gotten three of the laptops with the wrong battery.  In all cases the warranty company has shipped me a new one quickly with return shipping paid for the wrong battery.The one downside is the fact that the laptops are 5 years old.  So they have been around the block a few times.","Other Thoughts:Even with the listed cons, I would still recommend these computers for anyone that needs a solid laptop at an unbeatable price.It may have some minor cosmetic issues, but I have yet to get one that is completely unusable.I love Lenovo and these laptop beat the heck out of any of the newer Edge model laptops at a fraction of the cost.",0,0

Just not enough grunt there.,"Cons:Strange Keyboard - the numeric keypad portion does not work, no numlock funtionality, I use an external monitor, keyboard and mouse. Lost some of my mouse funtionality for a period today, no left click and scroll. I tried another mouse with no help and Googled around and the Lenovo came up as having issues. Not sure if it is drivers or hardware but it started working again.",Other Thoughts:You pretty much get what u pay for. I think a new Lenovo similar would run around $1200 new.

DELL,E6420,2,Disappointed.,2015-09-25,"Pros:- Newegg processed RMA quickly, paid return shipping, and processed refund quickly","Cons:- QA on refurbs is very poor.  Laptop would not charge and reported the problem on the first boot.  Obviously nobody checked it.- For any refurb, I strongly suggest spending the time to do a thorough mechanical/visual inspection and a thorough run through of machine diagnostics- Asked for a replacement and instead received a refund without any notification - left me wondering if they would ship a replacement at some point.  A 20 minute (15 minutes of which was waiting) chat with customer support told me ""the refund is how we notify you that you will not receive a replacement""- Two phone calls to customer service both responded that wait times were 30 to 90 minutes.  Don't hold your breath.  I hung up.","Other Thoughts:Purchasing a refurb from Newegg is a gamble.  They don't do any QA to speak of, so you have to do it yourself.  Resist the urge to use it right away, and instead do a thorough inspection and a few days of manufacturer and third party diagnostics.  It will save you lots of grief.  This review would be one star but the quick RMA, free return shipping, and quick refund make it two stars.",3,0

DELL,E5430,5,Works as Expected,2017-11-15,"Pros:- Cheap- Light-weight- Power efficient- All required ports work fine- Screen has no noticed damage such as dead pixels or scratches- Keyboard looks and feels new- Successfully swapped the HDD for a 256GB SSD and the RAM for 2 x 8GB RAM.----- Loads OS, apps, and files at an incredible speed... Impressive!----- 16GB of RAM allows me to conduct real work on it- The battery can last over 4 hours after the swap","Cons:- HDD is in early stages of death (I was planning on replacing it with an SSD anyways, so no loss of an Egg)- Screen was flickering until I tightened the contacts to a few loose cables (easy fix & no real damage, so no loss of an Egg)- The outside of the case shows that the laptop has been well used... moderate-level wear-and-tear albeit does not impact any component within; so no loss of an Egg- Provided a E5430-compatible replacement charger rather then original - it is slightly loose at its laptop port. Not enough to lose an Egg, however.","Other Thoughts:After evaluating a Win10 Home version E5430, I chose to order a Win10 Pro version for my work and college. With a few modifications (SSD & RAM replacements; tighten a few loose cables), it performs faster then expected!For work, school, and internet browsing, I would recommend a laptop like this.

The original buyer returned it for that reason and thats why it looks brand new.On first bootup you can clearly see the airplane logo in the lower right bottom of the task bar.

I would say that this is not a guaranteed outcome, but it was a pleasant surprise.  Keyboard still lively, feels good.  Hinges feel tight.  Power plug socket feels tight.  Windows activation via key on new sticker (on bottom) was a breeze.  Screen and CPU fan like new.  Built very solidly.  USB 3.0 port!  Fast CPU.","Cons:All the shortcomings of an older (2012) laptop, when compared to a newer laptop that costs 4-6x as much, especially weight and thickness, but also lower screen resolution and/or contrast.  Also, there is bound to be some risk in getting refurbished or recondition (used) PCs, especially laptops--but newegg hasn't let me down yet; this one was refurbished by a well-known company that used to have a mediocre reputation, but perhaps that has changed.","Other Thoughts:I would recommend this product, and other business-class laptop refurbs, when sold and shipped by newegg, for sure.  Just do your research and know what you will and won't be getting in terms of weight, ports, screen quality, battery life (usually compares unfavorably to newer, power-sipping laptops), and return policy/warranty.",1,0

Fantastic speed, RAM, the SSD is a huge perk. At the price point I got it at (<$500) I couldn't match any of the specs on another system.

HP,8560P,2,Plenty of power under the hood but lowsy display,2015-07-11,"Pros:Processor, ram, and SSD make this a very fast and powerful machine.","Cons:This unit does NOT have a backlit keyboard.The display is terrible on it. It only supports up to 1366x768 and is not crisp at all. Text tends to look very mushy on the display and while it's a very bright display it's very washed out and lacks vibrant color.Screen came with some bad pixels as well, I have a small blob of them on the right hand side of the screen about half way down so if you get one be sure to check the screen well.The speakers on it will not work for any multimedia. They are so soft you have to turn the laptop to 100% just to hear your basic windows sound if you are not in a completely quiet room. Turning on loudness equalization in control panel does help but I still couldn't watch a movie with the fan on and hear it properly.This laptop does not come with the proper HP Windows image, nor does it have all the proper drivers installed for you to use the keyboard fully and Bluetooth. I was able to get the keyboard driver and a few other drivers from the HP site, however the Bluetooth driver listed for this laptop there doesn't work with it and the drivers that it comes with for Bluetooth do NOT support Bluetooth audio which also meant i couldn't use my good Bose speakers to fix the internal speaker problem with this laptop.This laptop does NOT come with restore media and all the HP tags have been removed from it that might tell you what model to order restore DVD's from HP to get them back.The flashlight next to the webcam for the keyboard is terrible, it's very distracting when trying to use the laptop and doesn't light up the keyboard effectively.The packaging the laptop came in was almost nonexistent.  The laptop was literally sliding around inside the box because it wasn't secured properly. This is not because the packaging broke loose inside the box, it's because the packaging method that was used to re-box it and ship it was completely sub-par. This is a pretty heavy laptop and it was simply vacuformed (very poor job of it as the plastic was loose around it) onto the back of a piece of cardboard and then placed into a larger box. There was zero impact protection inside the box to protect the unit.",Other Thoughts:This is a very powerful machine that can not be used for anything in which a power user would want to use an Elitebook for.,1,0

I personally have an i5 3210m in my laptop (2.5-3.1ghz) which sucks double the power and only scores 20 more points in cinebench r15.i5 4010u: 236i5 3210m: 256Very power efficient My girlfriend is able to do 3 sometimes 4 rounds of League of legends before we need to plug it in (about 2 hours-3 hours) otherwise we are seeing as much as 4-6 hours for basic web browsing and paper writing.  It is very pleasant to hold and feels very solid. Shiny finish on the sides and a pleasant texture for grip. The integrated graphics are a decent step up in what they are capeable of for this laptop HOWEVER,"Cons:1 stick of 8gb of ram. This is a boost to the average user who is not too  worried about graphics output. 1 stick of 8gb of ram will mean a bit less power consumption which adds to more battery life, but since it is not dual channel setup, the integrated graphics take a hit in performance by restricting the memory bus to 64 bit instead of 128. This is not a gaming laptop though so this shouldnt be a bother to most people. My gf is still able to play league with 40-80fps on med high settings (minor stutters).3 cell battery. I WOULD LOVE to see how long this thing would last if it had a 6 cell battery. Still gets has good battery life and the 3 cell allows this to be fairly lightweight.Speakers are a little quiet.","Other Thoughts:For an i5 laptop from dell with 8gb of ram and 1 tb of storage, this is a great deal.
