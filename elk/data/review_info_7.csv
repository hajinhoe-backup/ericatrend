Lenovo,W540,3,Solid machine for the money ... it's just that touchpad?!?,2018-10-16,"Pros:- for the money, the performance of this machine is great. i actually liked it very much. it's a great performing laptop.","Cons:- needs a mouse. the touchpad is awful. Worst. Ever. Made. Period. the entire touchpad is a mouse button. also, with Windows 10 the driver makes the touchpad unusable. i could place my finger in the middle of the touchpad and the cursor would bounce vertically. it was simply unusable. i disabled all ""special"" actions from the touchpad and also used the ""basic touchpad"" setting that is available in Windows 10. i made the machine a dual boot and the touchpad worked perfectly fine with Linux. did i mention i hate the touchpad in Windows 10?",,0,0
Lenovo,W540,5,Huge upgrade!,2018-05-23,Pros:-Fantastic keyboard-Super fast boot time,Cons:-Rather short battery life,"Other Thoughts:There's a scuff on the bottom, other than that this is a brand new unit as far as I can tell. Would definitely buy again",1,0

DELL,E6420,4,Great Daily Driver,2018-08-22,"Pros:-Physically, it came better than advertised. As a ""Grade B"" laptop, I expected a few small scuff, scratches, other signs of prior use, but the unit was beautiful, it looked and felt like a new laptop.-Came with a Dell charger. Not a cheap aftermarket one.-The battery that it came with was a Dell 9 cell extended-life battrey.","Cons:- Bios came pre A12, I had to update it to the current A25- Windows 10 was the only option of OS that was available, took hours to completely update.-Every now and then, on boot, I'll get a message that my charger is the wrong one for this laptop","Other Thoughts:At the end of the day there is no arguing, this laptop is a great ""Daily Driver"" and buying this one was a great deal. There wasn't anything wrong with this laptop that was beyond my ability to fix, and I would definitely recommend buying this laptop, and would do it again without hesitation.",0,0
Lenovo,T520,5,Good Laptop,2018-02-01,"Pros:I have purchased several of these over the last few years and haven't been disappointed yet. The laptop is well built and for being refurbished, at times, you wouldn't know it was refurbished. I had an issue with one I received but I was able to return and get another one sent quickly. I have used these for personal and business use and couldn't be happier.","Cons:The battery life on some isn't the greatest but a new battery is cheap enough, if you know where to look.",Other Thoughts:I would like to see it with 16GB ram instead of 8GB but easy enough to purchase and install.,0,0

Awesome product set for the price.",0,0
DELL,E7240,5,Great Deal!,2018-02-21,"Pros:Small, lightweight, fast, easy to set up.","Cons:No cons, this is a great deal.",Other Thoughts:I like the custom instructions that came with my set up.  Saved me a lot of time and effort with the Windows 10 activation.  Great job! nice product.,0,0

Fresh Windows 7 install with no bloatware.

DELL,E6230,5,So good I picked a second one up!,2019-01-21,"Pros:Good specs, the laptop runs well and the price point is worth if if you aren't going graphics or gaming heavy.The laptop itself is nicely compact with a comfortable weight (sometimes if a laptop is small and light it feels like a toy, which this one does not).The USB ports and HDMI capabilities are also a nice touch on a laptop of this price range.Refurbised well and no complaintsComfortable keyboard too",Cons:The material around the keyboard/mouse takes a little getting used to. The touchpad is basic but functional.Also the charger is a bit bulky - it's heavier than the laptop!,"Other Thoughts:I picked one up, got used to it, then had to buy a laptop for a friend - so I picked up this model again",0,0
DELL,E6230,4,Not an i7 as advertised but still great laptop,2016-10-02,Pros:SSD always a plus. Windows 10 Pro. Sturdy feel. Compact. Not a ton of bloatware.

Lenovo,ThinkPad T540p,1,Disappointed,2018-12-12,Pros:for being refurbished it looks nice,Cons:does not have the Nvidia GT 730 graphics like it stated in the description. most likely returning for a full refund.,"Other Thoughts:I'm most likely not ordering from new egg again.

Lenovo,ThinkPad T540p,1,Did not have nvidia graphics card in specification,2018-11-12,"Pros:Nice cpu, decent price, delivered with windows without bloatware.",Cons:Specification said it has an nvidia graphics card.  It did not.  Had to return it.,"Other Thoughts:I like the products they advertise, but be sure what they advertise is actually in the spec or you will waste time like me.  Returned product.  They recevied it on Nov 7.  Awaiting refund still on Nov 11.",0,0
ASUS,P2540UB-XB51,4,First impression: A great basic work station on the go.,2018-11-03,"Pros:-Easily accessible drive bay-Room for 1 2.5 hard drive install.-The SATA M.2 boot drive can be upgraded easily.-Compact power brick-Keyboard has plenty of space for my big hands.-The i5-8250U keeps power consumption manageable.-The stock battery should last you at least 7 hours with a fresh battery, ~9 hours if you use the low energy profile.-The MX-110 dedicated GPU keeps OS visuals snappy. Light gaming like Overwatch or Fortnight will run with med to low settings.","Cons:-Only one of the two 4 GB RAM chips can be replaced. Keep this in mind when buying upgrade kits.-2.5 hard drive bay under the smaller drive bay panel uses a lot of foam to secure the hard drive. For heat concerns, I wouldn't use a HDD as boot drive.-The cover for the optical drive slot does not come off the stand in block. If installing a caddie into position, you may not be able to find a cover that sits flush with the sides of the case.-Does not come with screws for the 2.5 hard drive slot.-Track pad buttons are build into the pad, not as separate keys.-I don't like the shallow groves over the textured lid, they collect finger prints easily. Keep this one in a cheep slip case with a microfiber cloth if your not using a laptop case.","Other Thoughts:I purchased this laptop as a replacement for a 2012 Mac Book Pro that had suffered a 3 foot drop. As far as performance goes, it's a capable machine, though some comforts in regards to display are missed. Picture is about par for the course at this level.The plastic case is study and doesn't wobble much. There are a few screws and the attached speakers to remove when getting inside the lower panels, but the bulk of this machine is serviceable.The USB 3.0 ports are all on the left side. They are spaced widely enough for most cables and devices to fit. The single USB 2.0 port is placed on the right side, next to the drive bay. If you have a mini receiver for wireless devices, this is the place to put it.This laptop is best suited for work in the field, but not on your feet. Consider ultra books and the 14"" model for those purposes.",1,0
ASUS,X540UA-DB52,5,Great Budget Friendly Laptop,2019-02-22,"Pros:-Great budget PC with 7th Gen intel i5. Fast, stable and reliable.-Takes a Samsung Evo  860 SSD like a champ",Cons:-Feels a little cheap at first but it is solid,Other Thoughts:-,0,0
HP,450 G5 (2TA31UT#ABA),4,Good work laptop,2018-06-17,"Pros:Got it for my mom because her old laptop was dying, and she needed a new work laptop. Good, solid laptop that has taken everything she, or I, have thrown at it. If you are looking for a laptop to work on that will last a few year, I would recommend this one.",Cons:Gets a little hotter than I like or would expect during prolonged (1+ hrs.) of use. Not enough to make work on it uncomfortable until about 3+ hrs.,,0,1
Lenovo,G50-80 (80KR0015US),3,Good buy but fragile,2016-02-03,Pros:I did not buy this system from newegg but the exact same system from Microsoft's store.  I got this system as a general purpose system for my wife.  The system upgraded to Windows 10 without any issue.  Once booted the system ran pretty well.  It would take it a while to boot but that is not really surprising.  The Battery worked well as can be expected and the Intel 5500 Graphics did well even when my kids would play Minecraft on it.,Cons:The glide pad buttons were hard to push down.  If you hook up an external mouse this would not be an issue.The Wifi had issues out of the box but after upgrading the driver it seamed to do OK.The sound quality is what you would expect from a cheap notebook.  It works and does well with headphones but it is lacking on the built in speakers.System is fragile.,"Other Thoughts:The biggest issue is how fragile it is.  My wife dropped it from about 2 feet off the ground on to carpet and the casing broke and it became a desktop.  We still use this computer today but it is now a desktop with external, keyboard, mouse, monitor and speakers.Just in case you think ""What do you expect when you drop it?"" My wife had a Dell before this system and had dropped it from the same location +20 times and it never missed a beat.As long as you know the issues on this notebook and still want it for what it is this is a good buy.",4,2
,,4,Do Not Order from 6AVE,2018-04-02,"Pros:The quality of a MacBook speaks for itself, but do not order from 6AVE. I paid over $60 for one-day shipping and they still sent it via the cheapest ground method available.",Cons:The seller is incompetent and unfortunately unable to effectuate time sensitive orders properly.,,2,0
ThinkPad,T440 (20B6008EUS),3,Good laptop but was miss lead,2015-03-04,"Pros:A very lightweight, thin and sturdy design with a quiet fan. The keyboard is a good chiclet keyboard with the right amount of give and is not very loud. I also like the fact that it has a built-in and external battery, it is a great idea for those who are on the go and need the ability to swap  batteries. Lastly I like ports that it comes with.","Cons:Ordered this laptop for a renter in my office and I told him it would come with windows 8 pro. When I received it it was downgraded to windows 7 pro with a piece of paper that had a web address to take to a place where I could order the recovery media to upgrade it to windows 8 pro. The problem I have with that is that lenovo says it will take up to 3 weeks for me to receive it. But the biggest problem I have with it is that it was not advertised that it was downgraded to windows 7 pro. There is a few things about the laptop that I do not like; the touchpad is not up to par with the kind of system it is, it feels like they stuck a spring under it and called it a day and has no discernible click. Also the display port could of been a thunderbolt port instead. Lastly the screen could be crisper.",Other Thoughts:This is a well rounded system and I would recommend it to someone but would warn them that it may have windows 7 instead of windows 8.,0,0

DELL,i15RV-6143BLK,4,Much better than I expected,2013-09-19,Pros:User friendly with a moderate learning curve.Light-weightFaster than I thought it would beTouch screen is smoother than my tablet,"Cons:If it has any, I'll find them in the next few days but none so far.","Other Thoughts:After hearing/reading so many complaints about Windows 8, I hesitated for a while before I bought this machine.  I was the same way when Windows first came out.  I liked using DOS.But I'm older now and maybe wiser.  A couple of notable reviewers rated this machine as best in its price range, which is the most I could afford so I figured that I learned all the other versions of windows without too much trouble (except Vista) so I could do this thing alright. So far it has been an easier transition than from Windows ME to XP.Since I use an Android tablet every day and use a PC desktop more than that, Windows 8 appears to be the ideal compromise.  With iGoogle going away in November, I was trying to make something similar to get all my news in one place.  The Start section of W8 already does that for me.  The Windows store might not have billions of apps but I don't use but a couple of dozen and they have everything I need on the free list.  There are always compromises so I'm still adjusting to the start/desktop switching.  I hope they clean that part up but it's a minor issue.As far as the machine goes, it's more than I expected all the way around.  I got most of my stuff moved in an afternoon then played until late into the night.  I gave it the old 'let's see how much stuff we can open before it dies' test and it didn't die.  I was originally thinking to add memory, based on my old desktop but this thing didn't bog down with Bible software, a huge memory hog, and Open Office Write open.  Then I opened my desktop publisher and Photoshop along with Chrome  and five or six apps.  It didn't slow down a bit.The screen is crisper than my fairly nice AOC monitor and the colors are true.  I got the touchscreen mostly to defend against my granddaughters poking pixels out like they did on my Gateway netbook but it's already got me spoiled.There are better computers on the market but not in this price range.  I'm impressed with the Inspiron i15RV-6143.  Obviously my wife is, too.  She scheming how she can get it from me.",0,0
,,2,Out of the box unusable,2019-02-13,Pros:cheap for its hardwarea suprisingly sturdy case,Cons:slow as molassesCPU constantly running at 100% even after multiple restarts and uninstalling bloatware,"Other Thoughts:As a computer person, i bought this for my mom because it was decently fast for the price. I didn't expect it to run much more than facebook, but it took 2 minutes to open each program. A laptop should not be this hard to fix right out of the package. Do not get this unless you're buying it as a really expensive paperweight.",0,0
