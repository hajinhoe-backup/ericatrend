HP,650 G1,4,Great for the price,2018-07-24,Pros:Everything has worked perfect,Cons:Took long to ship,Other Thoughts:Good buy i always go threw newegg on refurbished,1,0
DELL,E6430S,2,It works,2016-07-19,Pros:Lightweight.Physical volume buttons.Lasting battery life.It's a little workhorse.,Cons:Came looking used with scratches on the lid.The HDMI port is out of alignment and is unusable.The speakers are blown and you can't really listen to anything because it makes a painful high-pitched noise.Printscreen button is awkward.You'll end up clicking page up and down by accident a lot when trying to use the arrow keys.,Other Thoughts:I'd only recommend this is you want it strictly as a work laptop.,0,0
Lenovo,X131E,3,Average cheap laptop,2019-02-24,Pros:Cheap,Cons:Slow,"Other Thoughts:Got this laptop for my son for school.  Being a programmer, I knew it wasn't going to be fast, but it was VERY slow .  I did some research and it seemed like there were people who were able to add more RAM even though it says the max was 8GB.  I decided to try upgrading the memory using https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231705 - it worked exactly as I had hoped...MUCH faster and now usable.",0,0
HP,6460B,5,Worked perfectly,2016-10-09,Pros:Fast computer for the price.  Excellent quality for refurbished.  No flaws or a single scratch.  Like new.,Cons:I little heavy compared to newer laptops but it is 400 dollars less than similar new one.,,0,0
DELL,E6220,1,almost zero support,2019-02-10,Pros:good looking piece of scrap metal,"Cons:Have tried on 3 occasions for their support staff to help me fix what I believe to be a small glitch. They sent me a link that doesnt work and only respond 48 hours after email. Can never get a live body which would fix problem in no time, instead I sit with a non functioning laptop for a week hoping I get another email so that I can fix their product. Where do I send my work card? Since they are asking me to do their repair work for them. Not happy.",Other Thoughts:the product could be excellent but the service and support is minimal. If your not tech savvy consider another company.,0,0
DELL,E6330,5,Extremely clean refurbished,2017-08-14,"Pros:Cosmetically 9/10, better than many refurbished systems I have dealt with.  Hardware works as expected, no bloatware.",Cons:None I can think of.,,0,0
Lenovo,T540P,4,"Great deal, excellent condition, nice specs",2018-09-02,Pros:- Speedy delivery on free tier- Much bigger than expected (large screen and full keyboard)- Fast enough to do software development work and even some gaming,Cons:- Minor scratches expected of a refurb,,0,0
DELL,E5440,5,Great refurb!,2019-01-01,"Pros:For a ""B"" rated refurb this laptop was in pretty nice shape with minimal markings.Windows 10 pro installed and NOTHING else which is a huge plus for me! Absolutely NO bloatware! No ""free trials"" of anything!The BIOS was clean as well.This was better than a new computer in my opinion.There was one small hiccup activating Windows but it was VERY quickly resolved by JoySystem's support crew who replied to me within a few hours via email!Overall I'm VERY happy with my purchase and would not hesitate to buy again!",Cons:None so far.,,0,0
DELL,E6430,5,great laptop for the price,2017-12-04,Pros:great price for this refurb product.no issues a week into ownership.,"Cons:none yet.maybe louder on-board speakers, but really... ?",Other Thoughts:quick delivery,0,0
HP,8570P,3,Nice Specs Kind of,2016-02-18,Pros:Full spec refurb,Cons:Heavy and when I checked installed RAM it indicated only 2GB of RAM total and a single channel.,Other Thoughts:Will contact the refurb company and see if they will make good on the RAM without sending it back.,1,0
HP,810 G2,1,Check it real close to ensure everything's ok,2019-03-16,Pros:Price,"Cons:The vendor never bothered to check the laptop, even when the damage is clearly obvious. Its not the first time I buy B grade used laptops from Newegg, but this one is just unacceptable.The one I got seems to have taken a lot of bashing. Not only there are lots of scratches and chipped paints, the base was actually cracked.  Maybe due to the bashing sustained by the laptop, the wifi would only work intermittently, and at times it wont power on unless plugged. later I discovered that one of the arrow keys doesn't work, but when I wanted to open up the back to see if I can repair it, only to find that the screws are worned out, two of them just can't be unscrewed because the + was so worned out it became a crater. As I am two continents away I am not returning it cause the shipping charges would be killing.",Other Thoughts:Beware and if you buy be prepare for the worse. Check really thoroughly right after receipt. Do a keyboard check to make sure all the keys are usable. By only if you can return without paying for a killing rate of shipping charge,0,0
Lenovo,Helix,1,Just terrible,2018-03-27,"Pros:The low price was attractive, although for such legacy and unconventional form factor it might be expected.","Cons:The model was different than that pictured, and what's worse the included power adapter did not match! As it stands, the system is effectively dead-on-arrival... I cannot even try out the hardware for one minute. Will it work with the right cabling? Who knows. Signs point to additional problems down the road. Should I endure a headache as cost of business or can I expect recompense for my fair trade?",Other Thoughts:This experience was unfortunate as I was looking forward to giving this interesting refurbished hardware a spin. However it has turned out to be entirely a waste of my time and money. Thus I could not recommend such a purchase to anyone at the moment; hopefully post-sale support can sort things out but I am quite annoyed.,4,1
HP,2560P,2,Right out the box didn't work...,2016-12-07,Pros:Was in great condition and looked really nice only had 1 ding and like 2 scratches. Great price especially for the specs on this.,Cons:Wouldn't power on so I'm not sure how it actually performs.,,0,0
DELL,E6530,5,Refurbished Dell Latitude,2018-11-13,"Pros:Excellent refurbishment, like a new machine. It was easy to configure and drop essential software on it. It was well shipped and arrived on time. It was really like getting a new machine.",Cons:No cons really. I bought this machine for someone else and configured it for him. I would never buy a machine with Windows for myself as I use GNU/Linux or BSD for personal use.,Other Thoughts:I do recommend these refurbished machines from Newegg. This is the third on I've bought (usually without OS) and all are excellent. If you can live with technology that is a couple years old there is a great savings buying refurbished. This machine comes with a warranty as well.,0,0
DELL,E6330,4,Great Value! Fast!,2016-07-28,"Pros:- Great value for 128GB SSD, 8GB RAM, 3rd generation Intel Core i5 & Intel HD Graphics 4000- HD webcam- Fast boot-up- 3 USB ports (1 is USB 3.0)- Professionally-looking laptop","Cons:- Loud fan (the loud fan noise made me the ""elephant in the room"" and not in a good way -- Google the phrase ""elephant in the room"" if you don't know what that means)",Other Thoughts:- I would recommend this product to other people; it's a great value.,0,0
Lenovo,T430S,5,Laptop was like new.,2016-12-25,Pros:It's a Thinkpad and they are virtually bullet proof.,Cons:None so far.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this refurbisher.  There were no issues noted.,1,0
Lenovo,T520,4,Works Great!,2017-01-29,Pros:The unit works perfectly and is very fast with the SSD Drive.,"Cons:This unit should have been advertised as ""B"" Grade. First of all, if you have to cover all the keys on the keyboard and the top of the unit with black textured stick on covering, that is ""B"" Grade in my book. Second,  there are spots on the lower rear corner that looks like some kind of chemical etched the case, along with a gouge that was painted over.  Good thing it is not noticeable when viewed directly from the front by the user. If I bought this for my self I would have retutrn it! Luckily my customer is not concerned with these blemishes.","Other Thoughts:I specifically chose this rebuilder because of the very high quality I have seen in their refurbished computers in the past. I have purchased and sold three laptops refurbished by Joy Systems. All three were ""A"" grade, looked and ran like new. One came with the wrong Optical drive. I made contact with these folks and they sent me the correct one right away...great warr service and good folks to deal with. I am going to let this one go, but the next unit I get that looks like this, I will return for a refund, take pictures, make contact letting them know why I returned it.",0,0
Lenovo,T420,5,Awesome product,2016-11-21,"Pros:Think Pad with core 5 , 8 gb , 256 gb ssd and win pro 10. Every thing i asked for and works perfect. At a considerable savings.",Cons:No issues,Other Thoughts:I would recomend this.,0,0
Lenovo,ThinkPad X240,5,Beyond expectation!,2018-08-10,"Pros:Even though its a refurbish, the build quality is still there and Lenovo Thinkpads are really a dependable laptop.",Cons:Some blemishes and discoloration which can be cleaned-up by wet-wipes.,,0,0

HP,ProBook 6460B,4,Great machine at a good price.,2018-10-01,"Pros:Perfect screen, nice size drive for my needs and adequate memory. Battery holds relatively good charge.","Cons:Minor weird screen issue (whole screen lines out) that occurs 3 times ,(every time) for about 8 seconds each (every time) early after startup then never happens again until next startup. Did not happen when I first got it. Only started after did first round of initial updates so think there was something hinky in the update. Not really worried about it and not worth return as I already have spent hours loading programs and files and really don't want to deal with going through it again. If it gets worse then that will be different but not for now.",Other Thoughts:Would purchase again. Little slow on processing/shipping. Of course SSD preferred but can't beat Arrow Direct pricing.,0,0
Apple,FF841LL/A,5,Refurbished unit but in like new condition,2016-12-23,Pros:not a mark on itfast shipping,Cons:no issues,,0,0
DELL,E6420,4,"Good laptop, but not what's shown in picture",2018-06-28,Pros:- Fast- Works great for internet browsing and using Office- Very good value- Looks almost brand new,Cons:-The picture for this laptop is wrong. It does not come with a number pad.,,1,0
Acer,A515-51-513F,5,Great product--easy to setup and use,2019-02-18,"Pros:-fast startup from the 256 Gb SSD-lighted keyboard! (this was a bonus feature that was a most pleasant surprise)--turns on by default when plugged in, Fn+F9 key combination turns on/off on battery-long batt life (8 hrs+, but I""m not a gamer)-quick performance from the I5 8th gen chip  (made quicker by adding 16 Gb RAM--you need to swap out 4Gb RAM card for 16 Gb--not really a requirement but I made the swap--for those who have made RAM upgrades, this is a 5 minute task)-noticeably quicker than Dell 5580 (I5 7th gen chip) I use for work-keyboard has a nice feel to it, and laptop hinges don't feel weak or wobbly.","Cons:-WiFi is ok, but could be improved (this has been noted in other reviews)--no hiccups or issues even with streamed video, but heavier users could find it limiting-screen is good, but not a ""wow!""--again, this is a budget model","Other Thoughts:-yes, I would recommend this product-this is a budget model that competes with performance well outside its price range-purchased a refurbished model, arrived in just like new condition.",2,0
DELL,M6800,5,4 CORES / 8 THREADS up to 3.7Ghz boost,2018-05-17,"Pros:Desktop like performance240GB SSD17.3"" 1080p screen & 16GB DDR3 1600 (11-11-11 1T)",Cons:Huge beast.,"Other Thoughts:Had to activate windows, not an issue the key is on the bottom of laptop but just be aware.A 4 core 8 thread Haswell @3.7 turbo is still a great cpu in 2018Basically, this is a desktop replacement w/o gaming.",0,0

They're well-designed, rugged, and run reliably. The T430 is not the newest, but it's a delight to use, and the keyboard is especially good for those who do a lot of typing. Highly recommended",0,0
