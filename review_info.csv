Six cores, 12 threads and with decent cooling (no manual OC) it will boost to 3.9 Ghz and stay that way. For the price I almost feel like it's too good to be true, perhaps not THE fastest CPU but can handle just about anything you throw at it now and probably for a number of years to come.

AMD ships this chip in their own box and you can see where the chip is stored within. There is a very small plastic window that protects it during shipment. Newegg decided to ship the AMD box, inside their own box without any protection on the chip side. I'm very surprised that it wasn't damaged on arrival."

First time owning an AM4 platform. Got this processor to OC’d @ 4.1GHz / 1.425V Stable via BIOS menu. Heatsink included, not recommended for overclocking. Use water cooling or something more like Cooler Master Hyper EVO 212. But if you do overclock, do so at your own risk!

But once you have it in your system you wonder about what those two extra cores could do if you had access  to them.Needs an x470 or higher end B450 motherboard to take advantage of it's features. If you aren't going to spend $150+ on a motherboard get the regular 2600,"Other Thoughts:I put a custom loop in my 2600X build, once bios updates came out unlocking precision boost overdrive and enabling you to raise all the thermal and power limits mine would easily boost into  the 4.4ghz. It would get hot, and it would really strain my cooling system doing that, especially considering it shares it with a vega 56 that thinks its a 64 aio. The performance in games and it's ability to multi task without that slightest hinit that the system is under strain is really something nice  to see out of AMD. comperable performance out of an intel system would cost you so much more it's kinda shocking anyone would throw that much money away. You could use this if you are a pro gamer and you wouldn't ever lose a game because of it. And if your're an up and coming gamer and you were thinking about getting an i9 system to give you an advantage. Get this instead, take that extra $600+ you saved and upgrade your video card, mouse, keyboard, and MONITOR to a 144hz or better and then you'll have spent your money wisely."

I came from an intel quad-core. Blown away. I was torn between the i5-8400 and this but I went with this because it has hyper threading and you can upgrade to Zen 2 later this year of next. Zen 2 is going to be a beast so getting this lets you upgrade as well. You can't upgrade the i5-8400 with future generation CPUs. AM4 is support until 2020. You lose a tiny amount of maximum frames but if you have a 60fps monitor, GET THIS. This thing is total overkill for 60fps. If you have a 144hz monitor I think Intel is best. But the multitasking and gaming performance combined destroys the i5-8400.Also the stock cooler is great, bigger than my intel quad-core stock cooler. It's quiet. I see no need to OC the CPU on a 60fps monitor. Maybe a few years down the road.If you're going to go AMD, get the 3200mhz ram with a CAS of 16 and a motherboard that supports it.

As I upgraded from a FX8350 its almost a lateral move if you don't include the fact that its a far more efficient processor as far as power is concerned and performs way beyond expectations for a processor with two less cores and 1.5ghz less speed(overclocked FX8350).  Also the upgrade path, after a mobo purchase and memory replacement, is certainly worth considering.  If you are on the fence about upgrading and you own a 8 core fx chip then calm down save money you're doing grand for now, buy components one at a time(don't skimp on a mobo b450 or above) take your time because a big jump is coming soon, if this is what the lower end 6 core processors behave like I'm very excited to see what Zen 2 is going to bring to the table."

I purchased one on Black Friday after sitting out AMD processors since 2012. I have to admit, I was a bit hesitant about moving away from Intel after such good experiences with their CPUs over time.This thing is extremely fast in everything I use it for. I do lots of simracing in VR... (Assetto Corsa, ACC, Rfactor2, RaceRoom Edition, Live for Speed, etc...). I can tell you without doubt, this is very smooth in all of those titles. It will not be faster framerate-wise compared to the fastest Intel chips but then again, it is  not as expensive either. What I look for in gaming, is the deviation between minimum and maximum frames per second. That is usually an indicator as to if you'll enjoy smooth gameplay. This CPU crushes it in that regard. It is 'glass' smooth in everything I've used it for to date. Encoding video is another area where it excels. I encoded an 89 GB video a few nights ago with this CPU and it did it in way less time than the I7-7700K and was almost as fast as the I7-8800K.",Cons:Would have liked to see it offered with a choice of the Prism cooler as an option... just to have a bit more overhead on default cooling.Not a big deal as most will change the stock 'though-very-good' cooler anyway for something more exotic.,Other Thoughts:I'd certainly recommend it to others and I am happy with the purchase after this much time away from AMD processors.

I have almost no bottleneck on either piece of hardware. The 12 threads is a very worthwhile jump from the 1300X I was using previously and I probably should've gone with a 1600 the first time around, or just waited for gen 2 Ryzen.","Cons:The stock cooler is bad. I personally haven't used a stock cooler in a long while, but Wraiths are the same coolers that came on the old FX chips just with updated mounting, and they are still mediocre. You'll have no issues with it stock, but if you try to bump the clock just a bit to match a 2600X (which I recommend, see Other), you are going to run into issues.","Other Thoughts:Using a decent heat-piped air cooler I was able to bump this straight to 4.0 GHz with no voltage adjustments and no crashes. I strongly recommend this over the 2600X, since the silicon lottery doesn't have to hit the Powerball to get a 2600 that can match a 2600X, assuming you already have an aftermarket cooler. If you aren't using an aftermarket cooler, the price difference between this and a 2600X will get you an aftermarket cooler so you can get equivalent performance."

This CPU needed 1.42V to get to 4.2 GHz and temps below 75C or the system would freeze. On top of that, the fans speeds required were much higher and subsequently louder. I dialed it back to 4.15 GHz @ 1.4V and everything has been stable and relatively quiet. 4.1 was definitely the point of diminishing returns in my case.

I had to go spend $140 I didnt want to. Obviously I didnt NEED to but I kind of did, cause nerd stuff.","Other Thoughts:Overall this thing is pretty stout. id recommend it, just AIO Liquid cool it, get fast ram, and OC it. Ryzen is a lot more capable than intel fanboys want to admit. personally im not fond of spending 400 on a cpu that a 200 one can compete with imo"

I'm happy (cooler kinda sucks),2018-12-06,"Pros:awesome so far. stock settings and comparing to AMD 6300 OC to 4ghz it encodes videos 280% faster. switches frequency appropriately and boosts cores as advertised for simple tasks. with m.s drive my win10 install boots in about 6 seconds after post screen disappears (about11 sec total), and that's to a usable state with a few start on boot apps and whatnot.","Cons:had to buy an aftermarket cooler. The stock was running 80-90c in a 65f room (sustained max load real world use, NOT prime 95, yes I installed it correctly). Too hot for me. while 60$ more, NH-u9s is quieter and still compact, dropped temp to 60-70c on a sustained max load on all cores while encoding videos.  I'm temped to -1eggo for temps on stock cooler, but the chip is so good  I'll refrain.","Other Thoughts:If AMD is going to try to provide ""higher quality"" coolers, which is fine, then I'd like to see the higher end chips have a no cooler packaged option for 10-15$ less that I could put toward an inevitable purchase and not have to recycle a brand new one that was used for a week then had to change."

But once you have it in your system you wonder about what those two extra cores could do if you had access  to them.Needs an x470 or higher end B450 motherboard to take advantage of it's features. If you aren't going to spend $150+ on a motherboard get the regular 2600,"Other Thoughts:I put a custom loop in my 2600X build, once bios updates came out unlocking precision boost overdrive and enabling you to raise all the thermal and power limits mine would easily boost into  the 4.4ghz. It would get hot, and it would really strain my cooling system doing that, especially considering it shares it with a vega 56 that thinks its a 64 aio. The performance in games and it's ability to multi task without that slightest hinit that the system is under strain is really something nice  to see out of AMD. comperable performance out of an intel system would cost you so much more it's kinda shocking anyone would throw that much money away. You could use this if you are a pro gamer and you wouldn't ever lose a game because of it. And if your're an up and coming gamer and you were thinking about getting an i9 system to give you an advantage. Get this instead, take that extra $600+ you saved and upgrade your video card, mouse, keyboard, and MONITOR to a 144hz or better and then you'll have spent your money wisely."

I came from an intel quad-core. Blown away. I was torn between the i5-8400 and this but I went with this because it has hyper threading and you can upgrade to Zen 2 later this year of next. Zen 2 is going to be a beast so getting this lets you upgrade as well. You can't upgrade the i5-8400 with future generation CPUs. AM4 is support until 2020. You lose a tiny amount of maximum frames but if you have a 60fps monitor, GET THIS. This thing is total overkill for 60fps. If you have a 144hz monitor I think Intel is best. But the multitasking and gaming performance combined destroys the i5-8400.Also the stock cooler is great, bigger than my intel quad-core stock cooler. It's quiet. I see no need to OC the CPU on a 60fps monitor. Maybe a few years down the road.If you're going to go AMD, get the 3200mhz ram with a CAS of 16 and a motherboard that supports it.

As I upgraded from a FX8350 its almost a lateral move if you don't include the fact that its a far more efficient processor as far as power is concerned and performs way beyond expectations for a processor with two less cores and 1.5ghz less speed(overclocked FX8350).  Also the upgrade path, after a mobo purchase and memory replacement, is certainly worth considering.  If you are on the fence about upgrading and you own a 8 core fx chip then calm down save money you're doing grand for now, buy components one at a time(don't skimp on a mobo b450 or above) take your time because a big jump is coming soon, if this is what the lower end 6 core processors behave like I'm very excited to see what Zen 2 is going to bring to the table."

I purchased one on Black Friday after sitting out AMD processors since 2012. I have to admit, I was a bit hesitant about moving away from Intel after such good experiences with their CPUs over time.This thing is extremely fast in everything I use it for. I do lots of simracing in VR... (Assetto Corsa, ACC, Rfactor2, RaceRoom Edition, Live for Speed, etc...). I can tell you without doubt, this is very smooth in all of those titles. It will not be faster framerate-wise compared to the fastest Intel chips but then again, it is  not as expensive either. What I look for in gaming, is the deviation between minimum and maximum frames per second. That is usually an indicator as to if you'll enjoy smooth gameplay. This CPU crushes it in that regard. It is 'glass' smooth in everything I've used it for to date. Encoding video is another area where it excels. I encoded an 89 GB video a few nights ago with this CPU and it did it in way less time than the I7-7700K and was almost as fast as the I7-8800K.",Cons:Would have liked to see it offered with a choice of the Prism cooler as an option... just to have a bit more overhead on default cooling.Not a big deal as most will change the stock 'though-very-good' cooler anyway for something more exotic.,Other Thoughts:I'd certainly recommend it to others and I am happy with the purchase after this much time away from AMD processors.

AMD RYZEN 5 2600 6-Core 3.4 GHz (3.9 GHz Max Boost) Socket AM4 65W YD2600BBAFBOX Desktop Processor,5,Very solid CPU,2018-12-10,"Pros:Perfectly matches a GTX 1080 in performance. I have almost no bottleneck on either piece of hardware. The 12 threads is a very worthwhile jump from the 1300X I was using previously and I probably should've gone with a 1600 the first time around, or just waited for gen 2 Ryzen.","Cons:The stock cooler is bad. I personally haven't used a stock cooler in a long while, but Wraiths are the same coolers that came on the old FX chips just with updated mounting, and they are still mediocre. You'll have no issues with it stock, but if you try to bump the clock just a bit to match a 2600X (which I recommend, see Other), you are going to run into issues.","Other Thoughts:Using a decent heat-piped air cooler I was able to bump this straight to 4.0 GHz with no voltage adjustments and no crashes. I strongly recommend this over the 2600X, since the silicon lottery doesn't have to hit the Powerball to get a 2600 that can match a 2600X, assuming you already have an aftermarket cooler. If you aren't using an aftermarket cooler, the price difference between this and a 2600X will get you an aftermarket cooler so you can get equivalent performance."

I was able to overclock to 4.1GHz with just 1.35V  using the included cooler. After that...see ""Other Thoughts.""",Cons:Included cooler.,"Other Thoughts:To push past 4.1 GHz I upgraded to a cheap arctic freezer 12 (space constraints, HTCP media case) to keep temps down. This CPU needed 1.42V to get to 4.2 GHz and temps below 75C or the system would freeze. On top of that, the fans speeds required were much higher and subsequently louder. I dialed it back to 4.15 GHz @ 1.4V and everything has been stable and relatively quiet. 4.1 was definitely the point of diminishing returns in my case.   I used Cinebench and Prime95 (only 30 minutes) to test."

After I did that this thing started to scream. My temps stay around 40C even after 8 hours of gaming, AIO liquid cooler, CM240. Already have it OC'd like an hour after installing it, right now i'd at 3.65ghz I believe and its sitting stable. For reference, I gained about 40 FPS over my fx6200 LOL","Cons:I didn't get the wraith cooler, it came with a different one but when it arrived it was damaged and the paste looked like it had been dragged through a sand box. I had to go spend $140 I didnt want to. Obviously I didnt NEED to but I kind of did, cause nerd stuff.","Other Thoughts:Overall this thing is pretty stout. id recommend it, just AIO Liquid cool it, get fast ram, and OC it. Ryzen is a lot more capable than intel fanboys want to admit. personally im not fond of spending 400 on a cpu that a 200 one can compete with imo"

I'm happy (cooler kinda sucks),2018-12-06,"Pros:awesome so far. stock settings and comparing to AMD 6300 OC to 4ghz it encodes videos 280% faster. switches frequency appropriately and boosts cores as advertised for simple tasks. with m.s drive my win10 install boots in about 6 seconds after post screen disappears (about11 sec total), and that's to a usable state with a few start on boot apps and whatnot.","Cons:had to buy an aftermarket cooler. The stock was running 80-90c in a 65f room (sustained max load real world use, NOT prime 95, yes I installed it correctly). Too hot for me. while 60$ more, NH-u9s is quieter and still compact, dropped temp to 60-70c on a sustained max load on all cores while encoding videos.  I'm temped to -1eggo for temps on stock cooler, but the chip is so good  I'll refrain.","Other Thoughts:If AMD is going to try to provide ""higher quality"" coolers, which is fine, then I'd like to see the higher end chips have a no cooler packaged option for 10-15$ less that I could put toward an inevitable purchase and not have to recycle a brand new one that was used for a week then had to change."

I OC’d the 2600 to the following values and tested the stability with the latest version of OCCT 4.5.1:OCCT: 3.9GHz @1.175 V = Peak 55 Deg. C / 4.0GHz @1.250 V = Peak 62 Deg. C / 4.1GHz @1.3000 V = Peak 68 Deg. CGAMES @ 4.0 (Elite: Dangerous / PUBG / ROE / Titanfall 2 / Overwatch / BF1 / BFV) average anywhere from 42 to 58 Deg. C with my setup. Of course, Temps will vary greatly depending on the type of case and cooling system for everyone else.I realize those volts seem low compared to other OC values from overclocking forums that I’ve seen, but the CPU and MoBo tested out very well with no errors in OCCT at minimum 1 hour each test. I have finally settled on gaming at the 4.0Ghz, as it’s the best balance of performance to heat for my setup and I like my temps low.4.1GHz is also steady and does great, but not seeing much more performance gains for the games I play to warrant slightly higher temps. I haven’t successfully hit the 4.2GHz mark yet, as the temps start to climb North pretty fast anything past 4.0GHz. However I think this territory is best left for an X470 MoBo, but I may still get adventurous and try again soon.Overall, a fantastic chip for a great price and if you had any doubts, buy it. If you're looking at the 2600X and never plan to overclock, you'll pay more but it's a fine chip as well."

This one is only $150- low TDP of only 65W (less heat than other options)- comes with a wraith cooler that is better than any intel stock cooler (EVEN MORE VALUE!!!)- gaming on 2k with a gtx970, I'm able to achieve perfect performance in games like overwatch, pubg, black ops 4... unnoticeable difference between this and i7 4770k that I upgraded from. My 144hz monitor would make any difference pretty obvious, but I couldn't tell","Cons:- Overclockable here does not equate to overclockable on the intel side. i5 8600k overclocks to 4.8ghz easily. This one bluescreens around 4.0-4.1ghz using the same corsair h150i AIO cooler (tbh, I don't really care but it's worth noting)- single core performance doesn't bench as much as intel- IPC (instructions per cycle, think of these is computational efficiency per hz) still not as high as intel","Other Thoughts:I have used Intel exclusively, starting as far back as Pentium 4. Avid PC gamer, Intel CPU + Nvidia GPU has been the golden wombo combo since forever. I have always recommended Intel + Nvidia to my less hardware aware gamer friends.This is my first AMD CPU. I went in slightly afraid that I was making the wrong choice, but I am VERY impressed with the value and performance. I cannot differentiate between this things performance in gaming compared to an i5 8600k or my old i7 4770k. My wallet sure can tell the difference, though ;).And let's be real, there's better things to spend money on than more expensive processors with un-discernible performance differences. At $150, it's a steal for what it is. I found this on sale with an MSI x370 motherboard (about retail $140), at a combo price of $240 less $60 of rebates and giftcards, coming out to effectively $90 for this CPU and $90 for the mobo.^ That's just ridiculous value, and for the first time in 15 years I will be recommending AMD over Intel to my friends for the foreseeable future."

I doubt if you would even bottleneck a 1080ti if you paired it with this CPU.-Best performance per dollar you can get in a processor.-Great for streaming, rendering, and other CPU intensive workloads.-With good cooling you can overclock it to 4.1ghz without any problems.","Cons:-Slightly lower clock speed than similarly priced Intel processor (until you overclock it).-A lot of games don't use more than 4 cores. If you have one game running and no background programs you won't get any benefit from the last two processors. But of course, everyone has Discord, Teamspeak, Skype, Steam, etc. open in the background so you will almost certainly have something for those extra two processors to do.","Other Thoughts:You can pair this with either an Intel or AMD graphics card. This processor blows the Intel equivalents out of the water, and it doesn't require you to use AMD for your entire system. Pair it with a 1070 or 1080 and your system will be plenty powerful enough to run new games for years to come."

Was so happy that this works with my B350 motherboard. I was looking for a CPU to run World of Warcraft better. This CPU took my gameplay from low/medium settings on the 2400G to High/Ultra. Warning: If you are doing the same thing as me, you will need a dedicated graphics card as this processor does not offer any embedded graphics. (I ended up going with a 1060 3GB)AMD has really been on the ball with keeping up or exceeding Intel's offerings. Went with this processor as I already had an AM4 motherboard.

(Needless to state, there is no comparison between this chip and 2500K when it comes to heavily-threaded tasks/modern games; it's about 130% faster, at 4 GHZ [you won't need to clock this chip higher than this; my board doesn't have LLC, so I have to set voltage to 1.3v to accommodate the droop under load]. [It brought Assassin's Creed: Origins from ~35fps minimum to more than seventy, e.g.])(p.s.

(Are you really going to pay $400 for a chip [8700K] that outperforms this one by only 30% [incorporating maximum overclocking]?  No, because you're not a complete idiot.)","Other Thoughts:This is the Sandy Bridge killer, folks.  (It had to happen eventually; it served me well for more than seven years, but all good things come to an end.)  Don't think--buy it (next time it's ~$165, though at $200 it's an excellent value proposition).Cinebench @ 4 GHZ: ~1360 (about 10% above stock clocking) (2500K @ 4.5 scored ~580)"

AMD RYZEN 5 2600 6-Core 3.4 GHz (3.9 GHz Max Boost) Socket AM4 65W YD2600BBAFBOX Desktop Processor,4,If you want the best performance make sure you buy ram matching your processor base clock or close to it.,2018-09-17,"Pros:Processor is fast, much better than my already decent Intel 6600K processors in video production and games.For video ripping and rendering the 2600X is as fast as my 5930K processor which cost hundreds more. Games seem like they play faster, or have less drops below 60 at 1440P when compared to my 6600K. Mafia 3 city no longer chugs and skips when riding at through certain parts of the game, and probably adds 5 FPS when compared to my 6600K processor.In terms of gaming performance the 2600X performs at Intel's non K 6700 Sky Lake based processors which is certainly not bad. It can beat the 7600 and 7700K processors in some games, but overall their base clock and IPC advantage is too much for this miracle processor.","Cons:- You need fast ram to take advantage of this processor. Ryzen's Infinity Fabric runs at the same clock speed as your ram. I found paring my AMD 2600X with ram running at it's base close or DDR 3600 produced better results than DDR 4 at 2400, and 2666.- On my Asus motherboard you can't run above DDR 2400 if all four memory slots occupied. Annoying, but I needed to upgrade my ram anyway as DDR 4 at 2666 mhz was limiting my 2600X performance by maybe 15%.- If you love overclocking don't waste your time as this processor can't overclock much, and the performance gains is usually less than 5%. I mean you get two more FPS, but that's about it. I was able to get it stable at just 4.2 GHZ on all cores, but AMD precision boost was able to hit 4.25 ghz on all cores stable so it works a little better than my manual results.- Lastly the cooler that comes with it is garbage as my processor would hit 80 degrees C often. Upgrading to the 2700X wraith prism cooler lowered my max temp down to 67 without the OC, and 71 C. with the 4.2 GHZ OC.","Other Thoughts:- If you're looking for a high performance rendering station for under $1000 built this is the the CPU for you.- If you're a gamer only you might be better off going with Intel's 8600 CPU as it's measurably faster in most games. In terms of game performance the 2600X performance is about as good as Intel's 6700 or 7600K processors so you can definitely game on it.- You need memory running at the CPU base clock to advantage of the processor, a real budget killer at DDR 4 3600. DDR 3200 with extremely fast timing would net your good performance as well.- I highly recommend this processor, just make sure you have fast ram, and a decent cooler as this processor loves memory bandwidth."

And let me tell you ... those 2 things + a M.2 drive & fast DDR4 ram clearly speak the words of truth "" The ryzen hype is real "" !! The preformance IS night n day diffrences. I have posted some numbers on my utube channel showing it.  Like in video encoding times I've gained 50%+ in render times vs old system. And same games with same settings & videocard from old system I have had gains of up to 40 fps making them smooth & enjoyable to play now !!I paid the extra over the non x for the OC headroom + XFR auto ocing giving less hassles to do so yourself. In my sub basement in a Fractical Refine R5 windowed tower with a corsair 650 HX on stock cooler on the AsRock Fata1ty Gaming K4 motherboard  XFR keeps all the core's at 4 ghz .. better cooling I bet I would be getting closer to the 4.2-4.3 ghz folks do with aftermarket coolers.Again ... if your like myself a ""mega-tasker"" do twitch/utube streaming, utube video's gaming & playing guitar & bass ..... this is indeed what you want to build a budget mainstream ""mega-tasker"" around is this cpu !!And remember .... without sales for AMD .. we the consumer would not benefit from the advancements & cheaper costs of newer technoligy.

I have 4 different VMs running on this computer and it doesn't have nay issues running them.  I play some games as well (PUBG, fortnite, etc.) and it doesn't have any issues with them.",Cons:AMD processors are a bit power hungry and generate some impressive heat.,"Other Thoughts:If you are on the fence about what to use when building a new rig I would definitely go with the second gen Ryzen processor.I have been a big fan of liquid cooling for some time and you can easily and very inexpensively get liquid CPU coolers today.  I would definitely recommend getting a liquid CPU cooler for the Ryzen processors, especially if you are thinking of overclocking.  The included Wraith cooler does a good job of cooling the processors but using a liquid CPU cooler will allow you to easily overclock quite a bit without a noticeable increase in temperature.  Using a liquid CPU cooler also allows you to run extremely quiet rigs without having to sacrifice speed."

AMD is simply ahead of Intel by about a year right now and it made more sense to go with this price wise. Better design with the chip than days past. The pins on the bottom or closer to what Intel does which isn't a bad thing. You can't really install it wrong which is nice. Again though. I went with this due to price point and value. I am happy to see AMD challenge Intel like this. Alos happy with the end result. This thing rips through games and work loads! Budget builds look no further.,Cons:Heat is an issue. Despite the efforts to send a reasonable cooler with the chip. I would count the wraith cooler at a failure. Yes it works... but the temps i got were just too high for me. 69C while running Overwatch... I ended up using a be Quiet Dark Rock 4. Made a 16 degree difference on average. The fact that this CPU series doesn't resond well to overclocking is sad... Instel has AMD there. I'd like to see AMD address this. Spare me the Wraith cooler and give me $20 back please.,Other Thoughts:The motherboard's built for AMD chips just do not compare to the qaullity that goes in to Intel which upset me. AMD needs to address this with the board manufactures seriously. It takes value away from this product. It's not my job as a consumer to make this happen. AMD needs to sit down with ASUS and other big names and gripe at them.

Running with low speed RAM 2133 16GB, a m.2 PCIe SSD (/ for OS) and a SATA SSD (/home for user data).  Did a quick check and everything appears to still be working with the new processor.  I used Arctic Silver for the paste, and the 1600 heat sink instead of the 2600 heat sink.  I plan on updating RAM at some point, but, shucks,  it is so expensive for a decent amount of RAM anymore!

Sorry but customer service wasn't doing anything for me so I figured I'd at least warn other customers about my situation. Normally I would never do this with how much I respect Newegg but this situation ticked me off.,"Cons:Let me start off by saying I started vacation today and it seemed like the best time to finally order and build a brand new Ryzen PC. Yesterday evening after work I purchased this a new mobo, new ram and paid for expedited processing and also paid for priority 2-3 days shipping so I could get it asap and have at least a few days to play with it and set it up before going back to the grind.I understand if expedited processing wouldn't get my product out of the door first thing in the morning but it took a little longer than expected. No big deal. However, I had been calling FedEx all morning because the tracker was saying they expected my order to arrive by Tuesday August 7th! Nearly an entire week after my order! I was told I had to wait until FedEx received my order to check it's shipping status and priority so I did and when I finally got the answer it was revealed to me that NewEgg shipped my product by ground even though I paid for priority shipping. This was an annoying revelation and so then it was then time to question Newegg about it.I called and Newegg's story changed a few times around but the answer was obvious. Someone messed up and that's totally fine if they were honest about it. Their reasoning that the shipping would take so long is that they don't work weekends and the processing would take a day or two and so would the shipping but hold on that doesn't add up.One it shipped out today so the processing was done by the afternoonTwo Fedex ships on Friday and Saturday so it doesn't matter if those aren't newegg business days. Technically I should receive it by monday at the latest considering I ordered it on wednesday/thursday.Finally according to FedEx Newegg did not ship it priority. It was shipped ground. I dont appreciate them not owning up to that. Seems a little slimy but could be an honest mistake.Either way I love Newegg and have spent thousands here, but in my opinion this is really lame of them and very disappointing to me. Why would they take my money and then ship it ground? Not cool.  They returned my shipping money which is fine but my whole weekend is empty now and next week on Tuesday I go back to my grind of working 12 hour days. I really could have used some fun this weekend especially when I paid over $500 and all the extra shipping to make it happen.",Other Thoughts:TLDR If you pay for expedited shipping and processing Newegg might just take your money and ship it ground and take their time processing anyway . Make sure you're on top of your order!

The 2600 is plenty fast for everything I will need for years to come. I don't do much other than gaming, some discord, occasional streaming. I don't run anything too intensive but it definitely has the speed to do plenty more than what I throw at it. My daily driver before was a laptop with an i7-4500u, which is a night and day difference but that's to be expected for a mobile vs desktop comparison. Overclocking seems easy enough, but I have no need for it at this point.If you're on the fence about Ryzen - DO IT and don't look back. Look at benchmarks, do your research.

AMD RYZEN 5 2600 6-Core 3.4 GHz (3.9 GHz Max Boost) Socket AM4 65W YD2600BBAFBOX Desktop Processor,5,First AMD build since the Phenom II days,2018-07-21,Pros:Lot of cores/threads for the money!Low power draw/good tempsStrong IPCXFR 2 is actually worthwhileA stock cooler included that isn't worthless!,"Cons:CCX design introduces latency relative to IntelNot quite as strong at gaming as the competitionMemory compatibility and speeds are still an issue, though its better nowInfinity Fabric interconnect VERY sensitive to said RAM speeds, and RAM is $$$$$$ these daysPerformance improvements over first gen Ryzen are negligible overall, because this still IS first gen Ryzen with some mild tweaks","Other Thoughts:Coming from an i5-4670K, this CPU doesn't exactly offer earth shattering improvements for my uses at gaming and common tasks.  I was gonna wait for ""Zen 2"" coming next year, but an unplanned event forced my hand.  Since I primarily game, the numbers would point out that I needed to buy an Intel Coffee Lake CPU, but I'm a little weary of Intel's grip on the CPU market and the resulting complacency.The performance advantage Intel currently has is MUCH smaller than it was when I built my last PC in 2013.  Haswell completely crushed all of the Bulldozer/Piledriver FX chips across the board, which is how I ended up with an i5.  Things have changed.  Intel's IPC advantage is small (`10% at best) and frequencies are respectable for Ryzen , though Intel still has a sizable advantage there as CL CPUs have a much higher clock ceiling.  Toss in the fact I'm gaming at 1440P, and the performance between AMD/Intel is pretty much on par with each other.  Plus, for ""i5"" money, you're getting 6 cores/12 threads versus 6 cores/6 threads on the Intel side of things.  No, those extra threads don't do much for gaming at this time, but having that extra compute grunt is not at all a bad thing.AMD has finally gotten off their lazy backsides and re-introduced actual competition to the space!  Coffee Lake is for sure a competent competitor, but that's the point, isn't it?  One last positive point to make is the AM4 socket and chipsets for Ryzen CPUs will remain viable until at least 2020 according to AMD.  If Zen 2 comes out and cranks it out of the park with 7 nm and an overhaul of the Zen uArch, all one has to do is purchase the new CPU, perform a BIOS update on their current board, take out previous CPU and drop in new one!  This is something Intel has not been good with at all, even when their socket remains unchanged.  They'll just ""require"" a new chipset, so current board owners are out of luck.  Having an upgrade path is nice.All in all, a great value and beastly CPU for gaming, production, and everything else.  Definitely worthy of consideration for anyone looking at a new build."

I buy what what I feel is a better value. I game and edit and this processor fits both uses very well. I am glad to see that another company is pushing Intel to compete. Intel has not had a reason to innovate in many years and now they do. The end user benefits from this in any industry. Lets hope for more competition. If Intel had a jump in tech, I would buy their chip."

(looking at you Intel)- The die is soldered to the heat spreader. It can't be delidded (removing the heat spreader) easily, but it doesn't use a bad thermal compound (looking at intel again) so delidding isn't necessary. Temps are stellar!- Everything AMD provides comes cheap and works great. You only need a mid-range motherboard to overclock this thing to insane frequencies.",Cons:- FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE DO NOT BEND THE PINS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PROCESSOR LIKE PEOPLE I KNOW!!! Be careful with those pins! Intel uses pins on their motherboard so it's a warning for both brands.,Other Thoughts:On a budget? Buy this processor! It's a more than decent overclocker. If you don't want overclocking you can buy the Ryzen 5 2600 for $90 less. Still works great.

With a stock cooler runs 5-7 degrees hotter. Not even sure if overclocked memory is worth it. I think system runs smoother and cooler on stock settings. So memory at 2400 mhz is fast enough for my needs, (i have it overclocked at 3000 at this point but may bump it down to original setting at 2400).  On my older system with am3+ motherboard ram with 1300 mhz, ddr3,  was fast enough to fly through applications, didn't notice much difference compared to this CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 16GB,that supposed to be faster, ddr4 memory. It is the processor that seems to be much better, compared to phenom II x6 1090t that I ran before.Stable.Probably needed to reinstall the windows 10 from older motherboard which was running on am3+ motherboard but just uninstalled the key and connected the same drive  with the same windows and reactivated the windows on a new motherboard with this processor, no issues.Had issues streaming Fortnite before. The old 1090t phenom 2 couldn't handle it, processor was maxed out at 100 percent. This processor doesn't go pass 40 percent utilization when streaming through OBS, with several other programs running at the same time besides the game.

I was trying stay in the $300-$400 dollar range for this upgrade, which ended up including the Asrock X370 PRO4 motherboard and Crucial's Ballistix Sport DDR4-2400 (2x4GB kit). I had originally been looking at the Ryzen 5 1600, but the recent availability of the Ryzen 5 2000 CPUs tempted me into taking advantage of their modest improvements. I also considered Intel's 6 core, i5-8600K, but the Intel solution pushed my budget envelope even more. (Beyond the cost of the processor itself, the Intel motherboards tended to be more expensive, and a third party heatsink was required.)Despite the 2600 running at about the same speed of my 960T (the 960T was overclocked to 3 .8 GHz when running four cores and 3.6 GHz when running 6 cores), I estimate that the 2600 delivers close to 50% more computing power than the 960T. World of Tanks, for example, had been CPU bottlenecked by the 960T, but that is no longer the case with the Ryzen 5 2600.Although the 2600 chip is capable of 3.9 GHz boost speeds, I more typically see long-term boost speeds of 3.65 GHz while playing WoT, for example. More importantly, this processor is doing a much better job of balancing workloads across cores. The 960T tended to bottleneck WoT, in large part, because it had one core running at 100%. The 2600 does a much better job of using all available cores.I experienced no difficulty running this CPU on a X370 motherboard (that came with a ""2000 ready"" BIOS installed).","Cons:The weakest aspect to the 2600 retail package is the Wraith Stealth heatsink. This cooler consists of a 90 mm fan mounted on top of a round aluminum heatsink that stands only 20 mm tall  (about 3/4 of an inch, not counting the fan). Part of the disappointment is that this is a step down from the Wraith Spire cooler, which the Ryzen 5 1600 comes with. The Stealth cooler is adequate for everyday use. (For example, while playing WoT, which only uses about 30% of the CPU's capacity, the temperatures were around 60-65 deg. C.) However under more intense workload, such as Prime95, the temperatures were up close to 80 deg. C. This high temperature is not enough to cause thermal throttling, but it made me uncomfortable. I suspect that other heavy workloads, such as a video encoding project, would lead to high tempertures, as well. It probably could go without saying (as it is generally true for all stock heatsinks), but I would not use this heatsink for overclocking and certainly not at voltages beyond the default setting.",None

That is why I chose MSI for my new rig. The amount of headers on the board are more than adequate for most cases, I found myself wishing there was a 2nd audio header on the board so I could connect the audio ports on my 5.25 accessory connectors bay, but I'll likely never use those audio ports anyway. I was pleasantly surprised to find a serial port header on the board, although the inclusion of a parallel port header is a bit confusing.The bios is very user friendly.

AMD RYZEN 5 2600 6-Core 3.4 GHz (3.9 GHz Max Boost) Socket AM4 65W YD2600BBAFBOX Desktop Processor,5,A good upgrade from the R5 1600,2018-05-02,"Pros:- Impressive gaming performance- Better boost clocks than non-X Ryzen 1 and 2 chips makes the X versions the best value this time around- XFR is a very impressive tech from AMD.  Eliminates need for overclocking the CPU.- Memory controller is a lot stronger than Ryzen 1.-Vastly improved core and memory latencies-Full performance enabled with the stock CPU cooler, no real need to buy aftermarket cooling",Cons:- None.,"Other Thoughts:I really liked my Ryzen 5 1600, it was great to see 6 cores/12 threads on a $200 CPU.  I decided to get the 2600x because of the higher clock speeds and the XFR performance.  It's an impressive upgrade, in games and everything else.  It's just snappier.I think the best part is how well XFR works- I don't have to do an all-core overclock anymore to get the most out of the chip as I did with ryzen 1.  AMD has binned these things to the wall and has a nice downclocking system built in to save power when not needed.  Watching the cores scale up and down to match workload is visually convincing, especially when you see all core overclocks going over the listed 4.2 max at times.Ryzenmaster also seems to have a single core overclock ability for the Ryzen 2 chips.  AMD has tested each core and stamped its rating into the chip at the factory.  Ryzenmaster displays these results, ranking them by best core in each CCX, and best core overall if you want to experiment.  But the out of the box performance is probably near the limits.  Very nice!Can't wait to see what's next from AMD."

I have run so many benchmarks with the stock setting and over clocking the cpu and/or ram. I was showing that leaving the stock settings on the cpu and only clocking your ram up is all you need to do. My result consistently scored higher leaving the cpu alone and letting it do its own boosts when it is needing it. I have this paired with 16gb 3000mh ram and a gtx1070. I get over 140 frames on high setting in Pubg, which is very cpu/ram heavy. Pretty much every other games I play is at max 1080p settings. Fortnite sits above 200fps. the vga has a lot to do with with that. I was scoring around 1400 in cinebench after clocking my ram at 3200."

It is very fast and robust (most likely).My MB supports M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 3.0 x4 parts. It fits very good there.","Cons:It is NVMe drive. Win7 does not have native support and WD does not provide drivers for this NVMe drive.MS is not providing support for Win7 anymore, in contrary to what you might find on WD site.Regrettably, I had to return this (hardware wise compatible) drive, because I am not going to upgrade to Win10 just to run it.",Other Thoughts:I wish WD will put some effort in providing the NVMe driver for Win7 and I would not have to buy M.2 NVMe SSD drive from the competition.

Boots from cold machine to usable desktop in 10 seconds. The SATA RAID controller actually takes longer to POST than the OS does to load. Doesn't take up an extra power or SATA cable in the case, so it keeps the build way cleaner.","Cons:It took me a bit to figure out the right settings to allow Windows to boot off this drive while the mobo was in UEFI. It was my first time dealing with UEFI vs Legacy, so it was probably just my learning curve. Have had no issues since.","Other Thoughts:Getting the machine to run this in NVMe and use the onboard SATA RAID controller was impossible on an MSI Carbon X370 at the time I get the machine built. I didn't list this as a con, since it's not this chip's fault. Wanted RAID 5 anyways which seems to be a dieing breed on mobo RAID controllers, so I got a separate RAID controller card as a work around."

I took one egg off for not so great price to performance .","Other Thoughts:I did 4 builds recently 3 with PCIe and one with SATA and see no difference in real life. Tests tell a different story, it is flying thru them, so what is up?  Unless I am doing something wrong: save money and get SATA instead."

Considering the price of other SSDs at the time of my own purchase, they were reasonably priced to boot.","Cons:The only possible negatives are subjective, and in my opinion don't warrant the deduction of any points.","Other Thoughts:-There's a bit of a learning curve involved in installing an M.2 SSD, if you've never done it before - be sure to read your motherboard's manual thoroughly, and don't just skim it like I did, or you might forget things like heatsinks (heh).-As much as I played up the speed in the Pros section, these aren't the fastest SSDs on the market by any stretch of the imagionation; the Samsung EVO drives are apparently much, much faster.

Fast when compared to any SATA SSD or HDD.  Able to completely start Windows10 in under 15 seconds and this is on a PCIE 2.0 motherboard. Well worth the investment.  By the way there is a hot fix for Windows 7 that will allow you to use NVME devices. I know because I have two operating systems on my rig; WIndows 7 and 10.  If your BIOS does not allow you to boot from a NVME it does not mean that the NVME will not work. First see if the motherboard can see the NVME when it is plugged into a PCIE slot with a PCIE adapter. If the board and OS can see the NVME then your motherboard BIOS can be flashed with an edited BIOS that supports NVME for boot up.  Hope this helps anyone with concerns about running a legacy motherboard.,Cons:None so far but I am only on month one.,Other Thoughts:If anyone tells you that older boards like the ASUS Maximus IV GENE-Z can't run an NVME over PCIE they are wrong. All I needed was an OS that can support NVME and a board that can have it's BIOS modified to support NVME. Easy as pie.

Since electronics hate heat going to assume these will last longer (probably won't upgrade again for 10+ years, if ever).","Cons:Not really the SSD's fault  but this and all other NVME SSD's are not Windows 7 friendly, as some negative reviewers realize too late. It's not plug and play at all unlike Windows 10 (a fresh install attempt from a DVD will simply result in W7 not seeing the SSD to install to), but where there's a will there's a way. My fix was to simply install W7 to a plain SATA3 HDD and install all the latest patches and updates (the DVD version is missing NVMe drivers that were added 5 years after initial release) and name that drive BOOT1. Install/update W7 again to a 2nd HDD and name that BOOT2. Now log into BOOT2 (via bios option) and the NVME should be visible in disk management. Initialize/format it and then Copy/paste Boot1 to the NVMe, shut down, remove the now-unneeded HDD's (I use them for disaster recovery if for some reason I need to reinstall OS, less updates and apps to reinstall), go into bios and set NVME as first boot option, restart, done. A bit more effort than simply installing once from a thumb drive but worth not having to put up with W10's cr@p.",None

I went to WD site to download their version of Acronis and no luck the site gave me an error, it was down at the time but it should work now/today.Finally, I remember that I had a copy of the WD Acronis edition in my flash drive, so! I installed it and w/o any hopes I gave it an ONE last try. Well, it worked, the WD ACronis own edition worked finally, I was able to clone the Intel 760p into the WD Black NVMe. My guess is the newer version of ACRONIS the culprit of the issues that may arrive if one were to clone the WDB NVMe.Although the version of Acronis that I used from WD seemed to be an older version compared to the newer I used, I believe it said 2016 version, I couldn't tell you what version they currently have in their site because it's down.My 256GB Intel was fast but I've always wanted a Western Digital and this 1.3GBs faster at writing, so I'm definitely much happy getting this drive and I can keep the 760P as back up."

First off you have to install it to your computer them get the right software and drivers.  3306MBps read and 2781MBps write,Cons:At this point just finding the right drivers for windows 7,Other Thoughts:I spent about an hour studying the right way to get this to work with windows 7 since I saw a review that said it wouldn't work. So I picked my windows 7 machine to install it  to. AOEMI back up helped a lot. I had to install usb drivers and then the nvme drivers and slip stream them into a back up of windows 7 and then the install went perfect. So I know it can be done. The speed alone is worth the trouble and it is large enough that my two 256 gig Samsung SSD's in raid o seem slow and not enough space.If you want a hassle free install just install it on a windows 10 or windows 8.1 machine and make sure you have the right slot on your motherboard. Also be ready to lose a couple sata ports due to using this. All around this is a great product and future proof. Just search how to install a NVME drive on windows 7 and you will be directed to how to do it. After using this for a few weeks I re ran the benchmark test and now I get 3457.7 read and 2807.2 write so it seems with use it gains a bit of speed. worth every penny.

I originally thought that all M.2 cards were the same – but they are not.  They come in several different pin configurations so you need to make sure that your motherboard/computer can specifically support a M.2 SSD.If you goof up and this SSD doesn’t ‘fit’ you’re not out of luck.  I was able to ‘convert’ this SSD to a standard SATA interface using the StarTechM.2 to SATA III converter Kit (9SIA24G5ZE3147) and move forward.  It was a ‘messy’ build but it worked out.Performance was very good.  I don’t believe in the theoretical ‘number based’ benchmarks but I will confirm that real-world speed was better than the EVO 850’s I have been using in my builds in the past.  I will definitely build around these drives when I get the opportunity!
WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,5,Very good - use with newer hardware,2018-06-11,"Pros:1.	Storage Size2.	Fast3.	Costs for the speedI love the fact that you can get 1 TB and ½ TB size on a M.2 socket. This is the kind of thing that makes sense to me. It is small and takes up very little space. Yet, it has a good amount of storage.It is fast. I have an older M.2 drive to compare with. In all test it was nearly twice as fast. It just worked.","Cons:Cons1.	Could not boot with all motherboards2.	Speed is nice, but maybe not the fastestI struggled getting this drive to boot on a Gigabyte Z97 board, but the Asrock board that was similarly setup worked without a problem. I used Windows 10 for all set-ups. It did work on the Gigabyte board as a storage drive though.This is not the bleeding edge of technology. It is a great solution though for much better than the middle of the road. If you need the very fastest times, then look elsewhere. If you want a very zippy drive then this is a good choice.","Other Thoughts:I really like M.2 as a form factor. It takes up very little space on the motherboard, but drive sizes have been limited. This drive answers the size question very well.  It is also blazingly fast. It makes it a great boot drive for a gaming system, graphics station or lots of heavy photography or video editing. Honestly, any system that will get it work will feel faster. This is not a Lamborghini, but it is a muscle car that is going to take you there fast.So, who should buy this drive, well most people would benefit from it. You need the large M.2 size 2280 and a M.2 socket on your motherboard. Finally, it should be a newer piece of hardware. Some older hardware may work, but not all. What I see then is a new build, with Windows 10. Look at this as the work horse drive then. It can handle boot-up and a lot of storage. I would not try to store a professional photographer’s library on it; it just won’t happen. But to work with the photos and later move them elsewhere, it is a great choice.I was able to transfer a 250GB of data in about 3 minutes with operating system overhead compared to an early M.2 drive at 6 Gb/s, which told over 10 minutes with the operating system overhead. This is a my music library. The bottle neck may have been on the other side or operating system. The results are still great."

WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,3,Soon to be OS drive,2018-05-31,"Pros:Respected brand, good specs, decent price. Looks like it deserves 5 stars according to reviews I see.","Cons:Packaging from Newegg! The small box it came in is the type that once fitted together on the bottom sort of locks into place. Newegg shippers felt it unnecessary to tape this part, so when it arrived at my doorstep, guess what? I didn't even have to open the box to reach in pull out the ssd! It's bad enough it comes via FEDEX, who've decided to utilize temp workers that deliver packages in UHAUL trucks. I've had one TV stolen from them in the past resulting in a criminal investigation. I'd prefer to avoid another incident. This was the first order I've made since the end of last year, and it may affect future purchase decisions.","Other Thoughts:Minor thing but lumped in with issues like the above it starts to paint a picture...They mistakenly sent me 10 samsung 128gb thumb drives instead of one. I rma'd them and sent 9 of them them back. I wasn't expecting anything from it and didn't request anything, yet they promised a 10 dollar gift credit when they received the items back. Never saw the 10 dollars.Maybe it's just me, but Newegg is beginning to lose some appeal."
WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,4,"Better than the blue, but not better than the competition",2018-05-30,Pros:NVMe (where the blue drives were only SATA)Affordable (at least as much as the competition),"Cons:For be a Black series drive, it should be a little more high end and compete more against the 970 Pro. That's just my opinion. But I do find it odd the price diff between the blue and black isn't more.Not as polished as competition in terms of accompanying software.","Other Thoughts:Newegg first gave me a WD Blue M.2 2280 drive. That drive I scored low because it's cost difference from the black was very little and it only supported SATA protocol.So when I got a chance to review the black, I was happy to be able to up the score simply by it being a true NVMe drive.Perceived performance during normal use was simply that it was a fast SSD. Loading Windows, booting, launching applications and launching games all felt great. I didn't have any weird compatibility issues and nothing to suggest WD drives were inferior in any way to the competition.However, there is competition and when you start looking closer, I don't know why this drive gets the nod. Take a 970 Evo and see that it's cost is similar, it's performance is similar and know that that is probably the best drive to compare to then. I prefer the Evo software (unless you don't like running any that is) and I think the quality of the controller is going to be better on the Evo.In the end this isn't a bad drive in any way. If you buy it don't feel like you are giving up anything. Its good. Its fast. It was stable and compatible. It's simple."
WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,4,SIZE MATTERS,2018-05-27,"Pros:If there is one thing I want people to know about this drive, is that size matters!  It is not plainly visible, but you will NOT get the advertised speeds with the 250GB or the 500GB version. See the Cons for more on this.The WD Black NVMe drive is a very impressive drive in terms of speed.  Even with the 250GB model, I achieved sequential speeds of +3000MB/s read and +1600MB/s write.  Do note though that these benchmarks are under the best conditions possible.  In my tests, they are not formatted and the test is performed on raw storage with no AV scanners turned on.  Nothing but the test interacts with the drive.  So while you may see lower performance in normal use, these numbers will give you a ballpark estimate.Installation was fairly simple.  My motherboard needed to have a few heatsinks removed to expose the M.2 slot I wanted to use.  Once removed, simply insert the drive in the connector and screw it down.   NOTE: This drive does not come with installation hardware.  The needed hardware should have been included with your motherboard! Also make sure you have only the needed standoffs installed.  Remove any standoffs that are not used for mounting.Once installed, Windows 10 immediately picked up on the drive with no BIOS tweaks needed. Simply open the Disk Management tool and initialize/partition the drive and you are good to go.  If you are installing a fresh Windows onto the drive, it worked as it would any other drive.","Cons:If you look at the ""Specification Sheet"" listed under the ""Overview"" tab, you find a table that shows the speeds for the various size of drives.  For the 250GB version, this is fairly significant write speed jump when compared to the 500GB model.  Below is a crude table of the information from the spec sheet:------------------250GB / 500GB / 1000GB:Seq. Read: 3000 / 3400 / 3400MB/sSeq. Write: 1600 / 2500 / 2800MB/sWhen comparing the seq. write speed from the 250 to the advertised speeds, there is a difference of 1200MB/s!  I really feel WD could have done better to disclose this than simply saying ""Speeds up to..."".  This little detail they buried in the spec sheet is the only reason I have knocked off 1 egg.","Other Thoughts:Overall, I think this is a great drive, but if you can manage the extra expense I would recommend the 500GB version for the improved write speed if nothing else.  If you don't care for the extra write speed, the 250GB model is pretty darn good too.  Make sure you have reviewed the motherboards manual for compatibility and resource availability.  If you are running multiple GPUs, you will want to know how the motherboard will handle the PCIe lanes as many times the secondary PCI express slot for GPUs will share PIC express lanes with the M.2 slot.  In other cases, the second M.2 slot may be limited on PCI express version or available lanes.CrystalDiskMark 6.0.0 x64 - 250GB model (Read/Write):Sequential - 3121.6 / 1608.3 MB/s4KiB Q8T8 - 638.5 / 555.4 MB/s4KiB Q32T1 - 637.5 / 483.4 MB/s4KiB Q1T1 - 49.7 / 174.2 MB/sSequential speeds are more descriptive of large file copies or any time consecutive data is read or written.The 4KiB readings are more descriptive of dealing with many small files.Test hardware:Windows 10.0.14393 (Standard NVM Express Controller driver v10.0.14393.0)Ryzen 5 2600XAsus ROG STRIX X470-X (BIOS 4011 - AGESA 1.0.0.2a + SMU 43.18)G.Skill TridentZ DDR4-3200 (Running at 3400MHz)"

WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,5,"Fine Fast Solid NVME M.2 Drive, Great for games!",2018-05-17,"Pros:When I first looked into M.2 NVMe drives for booting I was a bit apprehensive at first. I didn't think it would be as easy as it was. But I just stuck this stick of gum sized stick on my board and I had storage right on the board. It's going from using standard SATA SSDs to something even smaller and more convenient to install.OS install was easy, everything just worked and this was the fastest install of Windows I've ever experienced. Booting is lighting fast and I have a bunch of stuff start up. Within seconds of hitting the power-button I have Steam, Origin, Corsair CUE, Corsair LiNK, battle.Net and nVidia's Geforce Experience up and ready.Chrome, Krita, Audacity, Discord, pretty much all my programs load really fast on this.Loading games is wicked quick, freaking fantastic. When it comes to game loading, it feels like going from a HDD to a SSD, the interface and the memory used on this is a blessing. Overwatch replays load up wicked quick, and a neat thing I noticed is ever since I've used this drive to play Overwatch I seem to have much more time to pick my character. I assume that the game loads so fast that I just get to the character selection screen first. It's a nice plus for this drive if that's the case.GTAV loads nice and fast with single-player, and PUBG also loads very quickly.Transferring the installs from my old SSD to this M.2 drive was lighting quick, slowed only by the old SSD.This is a fantastic drive, I highly recommend it.","Cons:This is not really a con, but something to keep in mind. On some boards (for example my B350) two of your SATA ports will be disabled when using this or any M.2 drive. Check your motherboard's manual for more information.","Other Thoughts:I'm using this 1TB Western Digital NVMe M.2 2280 on my Asus ROG Strix B350-F Gaming, with a Ryzen 2700x, G.Skill Trident-Z 16GB DDR4 2933Mhz RAM and a Zotac Geforce GTX 980-Ti AMP.

Using my already installed NVME M.2 drive to test speed it was really fast. 2000Mbs on average and the install was easy and quick. Never had any issues. It also doesn't get that hot at all. With my test laser temp gun it hit about 45c when under high use. My test PC is a Z270 board with an i7 6700K. I think the original Z97 M.2 this will not work on but any generation after that you should be fine. I even did an install of windows directly on this M.2 drive after testing speed. It went well no issues","Cons:I really don't see any, price is even fair. Boot time fast about 15 seconds from push to desktop.","Other Thoughts:You can get an M.2 SSD for about half the price but the speeds will not be anywhere close to this. Around 500 Mbs for the WD Blue M.2 as its not NVMe. The other benefit is the saving of space, looks nice to not have the cables and SSD 2.5 hanging around in your case."
WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,4,Runs fast and cool enough not to throttle.,2018-05-08,"Pros:Installed and tested without issue in both M.2 slots on my AM4 motherboard.Roughly four times faster sequential read/write speeds than a fast SATA SSD according to CrystalDiskMark.Temperatures were ok in my system in both M.2 slots, according to HWMonitor, reaching 62C max in the PCIe Gen2 x4 slot and 58C max in the PCIe Gen3 x4 slot (the latter gets some cooling from the CPU fan).No cable management needed, unlike regular SSDs. Just install and you're ready to go.It happens to match the black and white color scheme of my motherboard.","Cons:A lot more expensive than a regular SSD of the same storage capacity.While sequential read/write speeds are extremely fast, 4K speeds are not that much better than regular SSDs. In day to day use I can't really tell the difference between SATA SSDs and NVMe drives unless I am copying files from one NVMe drive to another (my boot drive is a 250GB Samsung 960 EVO). Copying to and from SATA drives will be limited to the SATA drive speed, of course.",Other Thoughts:Tested on Asrock Taichi X370 motherboard with Ryzen 7 1700 CPU (not o/c) and 64GB of G.Skill TridentZ RAM at 2933MHz. Windows 10 Pro.Here are the results I obtained with CrystalDiskMark on each M.2 slotPCIe Gen3 x4 read/write:Seq         2169/2394512K       1496/23254K           46.55/140.24KQD32 311.4/202.1PCIe Gen2 x4 read/write:Seq         1296/1369512K       1058/12204K            39.74/90.864KQD32 178.4/132.1I am awarding four eggs as I am not completely convinced of the value compared to regular SSDs.

WD Black NVMe M.2 2280 500GB PCI-Express 3.0 x4 3D NAND Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) WDS500G2X0C,5,A worthy competitor for Samsung,2018-05-07,"Pros:The WD black NVMe 500 gig SSD arrived in an unremarkable black and white box. Please note the NVMe on the box.  This is quite important as you will read later on.  Inside was the drive itself in a 2 part plastic container and a fold out tech support and warranty paper in about a dozen languages. Nothing else was included.  Personally I think they should at least include that tiny screw that you use to install the drive since it’s always getting lost.Be aware that this is a newer version of a current WD m.2 drive.  As you’ll read below this is a much faster drive so look for the NVMe on the box.  There is absolutely no reason to buy the older drive unless you have a motherboard without a PCIe X4 socket or it’s on sale at a much reduced price.Installing the drive is about as easy as anything you can do to a motherboard… unless you don’t have the tiny screw and then you’re sc…..  But you get my drift.  The only thing you have to check is if you have a PCI-e X4 m2 slot.  The older your mother board the more likely you are not to have one. Check your motherboard manual or the Internet.  Remember… Google is your friend.The install of the WD Black NVMe the installation of Windows 10 Pro X64 went fine. There is no need to install a driver with this device.  I checked and the only downloads available were the SSD Dashboard and a copy of Acronis if you need to move your current Windows install to the new drive.  Since I was installing a fresh copy of windows I didn’t use the Acronis.  The SSD Dashboard however I did download and install. It gives you some helpful information.  It covers SSD temp, a pie chart for how much of the SSD is being used, an app for checking for firmware and an especially useful readout of what interface you are using.  Helpful for knowing why your speed may not be what’s advertised.  It does not handle manual trim so you’ll either have to count on Windows or download a utility like SSD Tweaker.I installed the WD Black SSD into the PCIe X4 socket on my test system which includes an ASUS Strix Z270G Gaming motherboard with a core i7 7700K processor and 16 gigs of memory.  It also has an MSI GeForce 1060.  This is my old production system that I’m reconditioning to sell.  That’s why I needed to install windows on this SSD.The WD Black NVMe SSD took everything I could throw at it in stride.  I played some Far Cry 5 at 2560 x 1440 and it ran between 40 and 50 FPS so I was happy. I got a crystal disk mark score of 3460 MB\s read and 2550 MB\s write which is just about the same as advertised on the box.  I’m only using the first box in Crystal Disk Mark.  It’s really only be used as a comparison so no need to fill up the space with lots of random figures.I had a 250 Gig Samsung 960 Evo in this machine and the Crystal Disk Mark scores were   3073 MB\s read and 1396 MB\s write.  This is a smaller drive so the scores will be lower so I’m going to say the Read marks were about even for the two.  The WD Black had a much higher write performance so maybe I’ll give the lead to it.I actually have one of the older WD Black m.2 ssds in my new production machine.  It has an ASUS Z370 motherboard and a core i7 8700K with 16 gigs of memory and an ASUS 1070 GTX video card.  The old 500 gig black SSD gives me crystal Disk mark scores of 1854 MB\s write and 773 MB\s write.  That is quite a difference from the new drive.",Cons:Can't think of any except maybe they should include that darn tiny screw.,"Other Thoughts:The new WD Black 500 G NVMe SSD is most certainly the winner.  I wish I had more drives available to test it against.  But it is certainly the winner.  To be fair, when you get to these speeds the experience is pretty much the same.  I mean using the computer in day to day tasks you can’t tell the difference between the old and new WD black drives unless you do a lot of transferring files or the like.  Office documents don’t spring open twice as fast and watching Youtube videos don’t magically go twice as fast.  So what you have here is an SSD that’s as fast as a Samsung 960 Pro that’s cheaper. I actually cannot find any fault with this drive.  WD has a super-fast NVMe drive that’s cheaper than Samsung’s best. Saving some money is always a good thing. You can bet I’m going to put this SSD into my new production machine."

This adapter provided the socket for the WD M.2 and made it possible to install the WD 1GB NVMe drive on my Z97 MB.   In addition, this adapter works perfect if you have a PCIE x 4 slot available.  The adapter can be installed and  used to clone this WD Black M.2 NVMe from your existing operating system M.2 drive should your system have a single M.2. onboard slot.https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=1Z5-0018-00020&ignorebbr=13.

Read/Write: 2829 mbps./1589 mbps.WD Black NVMe M.2 2280:  Seq. Read/Write: 2461 mbps./2789 mbps.*The WD drive's write speed is significantly faster on  this system.","Cons:For whatever reason, WD Support chose to not produce a driver for their line of NVMe M.2 PCIE SSD drives.  This drive uses the native Windows NVMe PCIE driver.  My Samsung SAMSUNG 960 EVO M.2 250GB NVMe uses a driver Samsung support offers which does improve the performance of that drive.","Other Thoughts:Brings back memories of the days when a couple of WD Raptors set up in Raid would boot XP pretty much faster than the trained eye could see.  If you blinked, you missed it.  The WD Black NVMe M.2. 2280 1TB is  about as cutting-edge as you can get if having a blazing, faster than meets the eye machine is on the short list of your computing needs.  I have talked to people working in IT who have never heard of M.2.'s.   It's fun explaining to them how fast this drive is.  Forget that SSD that gives you 550MB per.  Get one of these if you want a noticeable, effectively faster than you can imagine experience."

Ran CrystalDiskMark and speeds are as advertised if not a bit faster.,Cons:WD Dashboard software is not yet compatible with these new 3D NAND drives,"Other Thoughts:Docked 1 egg due to software incompatibility. If Western Digital got their software up and running in time for prime time, they'd get all 5 eggs."
