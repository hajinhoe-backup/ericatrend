EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great video card,2019-02-14,Pros:-awesome performance for the price-evga warranty/support,Cons:-none,Other Thoughts:Card is a couple years old now but has performed flawlessly in that time. No complaints at all and EVGA is always the best for customer service if there is ever a problem.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"This card is really a great gaming video card; it's super fast, easy to setup, complarably small in lenght, and I would highly recommend it as well as Newegg as the seller!!!",2019-01-19,"Pros:it's small in length, super fast, and easy to setup..",Cons:none!!,Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend it as well as Newegg as the seller!!!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great,2019-01-08,Pros:SizePrice,Cons:No backplateNot great for overclocking,"Other Thoughts:Bought this for a friends build with a 2200g and it gets about 100fps on fort at ultra. Very quiet, great price and aesthetically pleasing."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very nice card and best P/C,2018-12-22,"Pros:Good price: Bought for 329.99$ plus 20$ MIR, and also have a free Monster Hunter: World comes as a gift from Nvidia.Proper performance: A default frequency from 1607-1835, which is the best among all 1060 products, which helps run well on my games such as World of Warships, PUBG, Watchdog, Just Cause 3, etc.Perfect size for any build.Better energy consumption compared with RX 580 or 590.Nice EVGA boost software, easy access and easy usage.",Cons:Not that much strong compared with 20 series and also the brand new RTX 2060 is coming early 2019.,"Other Thoughts:Suggest this card for less than CDN 360$.BTW, I love Newegg, saves me a lot from Quebec."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great Performance but the fan stop working,2018-12-17,Pros:- Great for last games in 1080p- Quiet,"Cons:After 1 year, the fan break.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Fits in my MicroATX build,2018-12-16,Pros:Short. You get good value with all the heat pipes. Overclocked. The fan is off until it needs it. Faster than I need.,Cons:The manual is poor. It's generic and for many different models. Included poster isn't as cool as I would expect. Bundled game cannot be resold and is Windows only. Playing the game requires creating accounts on NVidia and Steam.The card is as tall as the spec. allows and the 6-pin power connector comes out the top.,Other Thoughts:Tom's Hardware describes a modification you can make to the heat sink.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good small form 1060,2018-12-13,Pros:Perform great on mini ITX form factor,Cons:So far so good,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2018-12-02,Pros:Card works great and most of my games work on Max settings coupled with my old reliable FX8350 and 32 GB of Ram.,Cons:No complaints,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice Card,2018-12-01,Pros:Small sizeEasy to installcheaper than local market priceLow power consumptionOverclock version3 year warranty,Cons:Not a double-fan versionNo backplate,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good quality powerful card,2018-11-30,"Pros:Quality build, powerful, quiet and cool",Cons:Had problems booting but fixed now,"Other Thoughts:This is a great card. Cool, quiet, well made and powerful. Great buy. Got it for 209."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,Couldnt get to work,2018-11-29,Pros:Looks nice and is small,"Cons:Could not get it to work in windows 10. Windows was very unstable and would crash everytime about 10 minutes after boot. Tried reinstalling windows still wouldnt work. Tried to download drivers but could not because windows would crash. Couldnt find a fix so I threw it in the trash.  Put back in my old card, system works great.","Other Thoughts:I dont know, it would not work, didnt seem damaged. But i just cant deal with this many problems. A gpu today should be plug and play, or at least tell you what is the problem."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card with only one real annoyance,2018-11-23,"Pros:Excellent performance, paired with a great price.","Cons:Having only one hdmi port and three display ports is a bit bizarre to me, and unfortunately I am going to need a secondary hdmi port, so I'll need to buy a converter. Again, just kind of an annoyance, but the rationale kind of racks my brain.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great performance for price, very quiet",2018-11-20,"Pros:- Very quiet, fan doesn't even turn on below around 58 C, and I haven't seen the temp go above 70 C yet.- Easy to install, small enough for many PCs if upgrading- Better performance than I expected. Good FPS in Cities Skylines on near-max settings (uses 4-5 GB of the GPU RAM).- Requires only a moderate power supply (it says 400 W minimum in manual)",Cons:- None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product for the price.,2018-11-18,Pros:-Fast-Small-Relatively quiet-Only requires a single 6-pin PCIe power-Has the firmware that doesn't shut down the fan-About 10-15% faster than the EVGA 970 SSC,"Cons:-I payed MSRP.-It won't make me a cup of coffee in the morning nor give me a hug when I'm feeling blue.-I think it's dying...every now and then, (no real rhyme or reason) the screen will fill up with a pattern of faint white dots and streaks.  This may last for a few seconds up to several minutes, then everything will be fine again.Edit:  It was the monitor that was dying.","Other Thoughts:I bought this to replace my EVGA 970 SSC which went to my little sister. I wanted something that was a little more power efficient and had a little more oomph. It certainly met up with my expectations, aside from the minor nagging problems with the patterning on the screen. Power consumption in gaming with my core i7 4790K rarely exceeds 200W at the wall."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card for it's price and size,2018-11-17,Pros:-had it for almost a year and no problems-great cooling for a single fan-fairly quiet-love the double ball bearing fan,Cons:-none yet.,Other Thoughts:-definitely would buy again if I had to
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card,2018-11-12,Pros:Limited volume (not too long)Only (1) 6 pin connectorWorks great on in a Dell XPS w/460W PSPriced well with rebate,Cons:None yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,works as expected,2018-11-11,Pros:works as expected. great product. competitive price. thank you.,Cons:n/a,Other Thoughts:n/a
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Good card, but slightly noisy fan",2018-10-22,"Pros:Easy to set up - plugged it in, turned PC on, ran NVidia graphics driver updater, done.Small - looks like it would fit in just about any PC (but check with the manufacturer before cramming it in a mITX case)Powerful - this card has more than enough power to play anything I want (though I only have a 60Hz 1080p screen). I'm glad I went with the 6GB version over the 3, since it's not much more expensive.","Cons:I think this is typically of all single-fan powerful cards, but you can almost always hear that fan going, especially under load. It's not like, really loud, but you can definitely hear it over any of the other noises in your computer. If you've got the dough, I'd get a double-fan version. But if you're on a budget and/or you don't mind a little fan noise, it's not too bad.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Buy this card from Newegg,2018-10-04,"Pros:- Small factor- Fans do not go over 1300rmp under load and are silent- 22 C idle; low 60's when playing games- Evga has great customer support, which alone is worth it","Cons:- Got this card locally cause I couldn't wait for delivery.. big mistake. Card was running 45C idle, and 80C under load. Fan was going 2800 rpm and sounding like a leaf blower. I couldn't play games even with my open ear headphones on.","Other Thoughts:Local retailer CanadaComputers didn't want to replace the card under 14 day replacement warranty, they said it is final sale (contrary to what is stated on the product page). Did RMA with EVGA 2 days later I got a new card that is running great.Kinda wish that I got the proper card the first time around, but still cannot take an egg off."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great video card!,2018-09-06,"Pros:Well built....small, compact, stays cool and works great!",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Works great with my MSI Z370 M5 Gaming MB!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful but NOISEY,2018-09-04,Pros:Far exceeds my expectations. Runs everything I've thrown at it with Ultra/Extreme settings.,"Cons:LOUD when running bigger games. Seriously.. You might think a miniature jet is taking off from your computer. Not enough to take a star off, but something to keep in mind if you want a silent rig.","Other Thoughts:From all the research I've done, this card is the very best price to performance value at the moment.EDIT: After close to a year of use, this thing is still going strong and performing so much better than I ever expected."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It does what it does and does it well,2018-08-21,"Pros:Out of the box, it posts decent temps and isn't a power hog. Farcy 5 on all ultra settings w/a few modifications to bump up frame rates; ditto for Battlefront 2 and the Wolfenstein titles. It benchmarks decent FPS numbers in 1080p settings. I got this a entry/mid level build for my rig since I'm still pretty new at PC building, so this gave me what I desired at the time. I wasn't expecting blazing 4K gaming or was going to demand 3D rendering that a 1080 Ti would do without breaking a sweat.  I've been learning as I go with overclocking and this thing sure has taken a beating and hasn't quit yet.","Cons:There are some comments, but nothing that would make me take an egg/star away.  Tends to get a bit warm (75-77c) when overclocked, but that could also just have been the small form factor and just normal for a single fan card. I also didn't play with the fan curve. I kind of was hoping the ""EVGA GEFORCE..."" lettering on the side was LED, but it's not. Not many people like that, but I do. No backplate for bling or heat dissipation. XOC desn't allow for much tweaking with this model GPU, which I guess is understandable for an entry/mid level card.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to someone. Just don't expect it to give you gtx 1080 FPS or get blown away with 4K graphics. Only two things I'd change would be to give it a backplate and that cool LED light for the lettering on the side. Other than that, it's a solid buy."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Quality product.,2018-08-10,Pros:Great performance.Super quiet.Convenient size for MT builds.,Cons:None so far.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,RMA'd twice,2018-08-09,Pros:- Runs well for 1060- Lowish heat output,"Cons:- My first card (brand new) broke after 4 months of use, it fans stopped spinning and black screen on post.- My 2nd card (refurbed one they sent me via RMA) broke after 1 year, DVI port stopped working and eventually card stopped output","Other Thoughts:I'm not sure, when this card works, it works very well for the price point, but I've gone through TWO of them in 2 years and I'm not overclocking, they have proper cleaning/air cooling, etc.... The RMA process is a nightmare for Australia to Taiwan office because they never pick up the phone (english, if you select Chinese they pick up immediately).A bit bummed because I've already spent 100$ in postage sending the RMA's back to the warehouse which means I could have bought a 1070 at this point.  I asked for a different card and both times they've sent me refurbed models that seem to break.My warranty is almost at the 3 year point and I'm afraid this 3rd card will break and I'll be out of luck.This is my 4th EVGA card in my lifetime (25+ years of gaming) and it might be my last sad to say. :("
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,This thing performs like crazy!!,2018-08-06,Pros:Runs really strong and decently cool. Sits around 65°c at full throttle.,Cons:It could look a little better.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this as kind of a filler until I could get a 1080ti or the next generation gpu when they come out. Now that I've got it and overclocked it, I don't know if I can justify upgrading. With all epic settings on Ark and some settings like shadows and sky effects turned down, I'm getting anywhere from 50 to 100fps easily. It's definitely putting me in a hard spot to upgrade..."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Aye,2018-07-13,"Pros:-EVGA swag is undeniably cool.  (Love their customer service.)-1080p on 1092x1024?  No problemo! (I might be getting older - but - I'm content with monitor as it is.-I turned on V-Sync and kept it on.  This plays all the current AAA titles like butter on bread.)-Below $300-Efficient and compact, baby!  (There's nothing quite like being able to remove power cords from a case.)","Cons:-Might only last a couple years at max settings in certain titles, but coming from a 760GTX with a stock of games I'm still enjoying from this generation - I'm not too worried.   (My next big upgrade will probably finally lift me off from the x58/1366 chipset.  Until then I have plenty left in this rig to get me by and so will you.)","Other Thoughts:It's louder, but not annoyingly so.  I was worried it'd be a jet turbine on liftoff compared to my dual-fan solution.   I haven't OC'd or messed with settings, but I hear it has some further potential there, too."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Its EVGA, don't think twice",2018-07-04,"Pros:Tiny card, packs a punch",Cons:its not a 1080ti,Other Thoughts:This thing is screaming to get cranked out with VR. Runs beautifully and does a whole lot of work while fitting more than comfortably in a mid-sized case. For someone who wouldn't typically overclock the SC does just fine.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Pretty beefy card for the price/size.,2018-07-02,Pros:It was pretty plug and play. Update the drivers on this baby beast and ride the dragon. It plays all my games at max setting and looks great doing it.,"Cons:Idk, I guess a con is that it's not a 1080?",Other Thoughts:I do recommend this little guy. It's compact and awesome.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Small, Tasty Card",2018-06-28,Pros:Good speed and quality you expect to get from EVGANice dust covers for ports that are not being used.,"Cons:It is an ""older"" technologyConstantly sold out (but that is because it sells fast)",Other Thoughts:The fan isn't THAT loud. I've never come across a system or component that was truly silent or quiet.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful little card,2018-06-27,"Pros:Its a small, powerful card.  1080p Gaming this is a card i'd recommened as long as your willing to turn down some settings sometimes to keep the frame rate up.","Cons:While small is a pro, its also a con in this case.  The small heatsink and fan make the card rev up a bit to stay cool.  Runs warmer unless you set a fan speed profile yourself to a higher level.",Other Thoughts:Good card all around.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great GPU,2018-06-23,"Pros:- Easy Install- Idles at 40, and under max load it's usually 69-71- Runs all my games on ultra between 60 - 150 fps (Modded Skyrim / Fallout 4, Doom, GTA V, Tetris, Pong)- No Coil Whine or other problems","Cons:- A bit more expensive than it used to be, but neither Newegg or EVGA are at fault for it obviously. $350 after taxes isn't bad for what I needed.- Fan is pretty loud when running games at Ultra with high frame rates, but it doesn't bother me because I wear headphones. It may be irritating to some people.","Other Thoughts:My first graphics card was a GT 660 (which could do little to nothing) and then I upgraded to a GTX 750 Ti (which could play old games like Portal and Bioshock), and finally upgraded to this. I had upgraded every other part of my PC but never got around to the GPU until now. To be honest, my main dream was to play modded Skyrim without going under 60fps, and this card was exactly what I needed. A little late for Skyrim hype, huh?The only reason not to recommend this card is the fan noise, but if you wear headphones like me, you won't notice it. I'm very satisfied with this GPU."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very Pleased,2018-05-18,Pros:Easy InstallFeels sturdy (some of the long 2 and 3 fan cards can feel too flexible)Nice upgrade for this PC (from an R9 380x that died)Low power consumption.,Cons:Price (but that's all graphics cards re; cryptomining),Other Thoughts:Replaced a dead card on the Frankenstein PC (made up of other PCs parts). So far works great and is a noticeable upgrade.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It's great!,2018-04-28,"Pros:- I got this for 380 cad when it was on sale, it's a good card, it's small and compact, which is a bonus. bigger doesn't always mean better, this card performs really well even though it has 1 fan.- Can run battlefield 4 ultra in 120+ fps- Can run battlefield 1 ultra in 90+ frames- Can run fortnite ultra / high in 150 - 250 frames- Since it's 6gb it can serve you in the long run, it also future proofs it as new games will eventually consume more vram.",Cons:- Everything is fine so far.,"Other Thoughts:- Would recommend to people who would like to play on high / ultra, because this card can handle high settings.- Overall a great card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good card,2018-04-28,Pros:PerformanceBrand6 GBSmall size,Cons:High price right now,Other Thoughts:This card performs well and had 6 gb which is great for future proof. It is also small so it will fit most cases. EVGA is a good brand for video cards and well recommended. If you can find better price go ahead. You have to check everywhere and do price match when available to save a bit. I got mine under 400 cdn. I remove a star for the high price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product! High Price.,2018-04-25,Pros:Everything works fine and it is a great GPU,Cons:The inflated prices from cryptocurrency are a bit sad.,Other Thoughts:I bought this around Christmas and its still going strong.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing graphics,2018-04-16,"Pros:I’ve never been able to play a game on ultra settings with solid 100 FPS and no frame drop. Amazing. Really feels like this piece of hardware was put together well, somethings you can just feel in your hands and know it’s not cheaply made.",Cons:The price made me want to throw up but I bought it anyway. Lol this thing is LOUD under load. Sounds like your PC is about to get ready for liftoff as soon as you start gaming. Maybe the loudest I’ve ever heard for single fan GPU.,"Other Thoughts:Installation was cake. EVGA XOC software is somewhat confusing but manageable. I recommend checking out the fan speed settings, options are quiet mode etc. The card runs hot normally hence the high fan speeds even with good air flow in the case. Check your temps and maybe game with headphones. The only time the fan kicks into tornado mode is under ultra settings in games. Oh yeah I wish the crypto people would go away so gaming gpu prices can be reasonable again.Cheers"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card choice for less money,2018-04-15,Pros:I have used this card since it was released and I have not been let down. I have gone head to head with other flagship cards like the 1080ti and I had better performance. This card boosts up to 2113MHz if it is liquid cooled and stays under 25 degrees Celsius. This card has no problem handling 4K resolution without a significant drop in fps.,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a good quality card like the 1080ti but don't have the money, then this card is for you."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic!,2018-04-06,Pros:-Runs Nearly everything on 1080p ultra-Low power consumption-Several EVGA programs and Nvidia program accessibility,Cons:-No VGA port,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,THE MIGHTY MEGA mini MACHINE,2018-03-14,Pros:Can run current gen games no problem.,Cons:4k Bottoms out a bit but that is expected. I run full 1080 Ultra everything on a 4K TV.,Other Thoughts:HUNT : Showdown almost at Full Settings no problem!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Easy 23MH for this card,2018-03-14,Pros:-Good for mining and gaming as well-Low power consumption and low noise,Cons:- Can't any find as of now any flaws,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance and a good price.,2018-03-10,"Pros:Excellent Performance. I was looking for a reasonably priced card that would play most games at no less than 60 fps at high settings. For the games played in my family, this has far exceeded those expectations.Price was competitive compared to other cards in the 1060 family. Nearest card with comparable specs and reviews was fifty bucks more.","Cons:None so far. I've been running it less than a week. If anything changes, I'll update the review.","Other Thoughts:Easy to install. The only problem I had was finding one of the 6-pin power cables for my modular PS.  Obviously, not a fault of the card. It came with a install DVD, but my rig has no player, so I had to download from GeForce's website. Easy to find, and no issues there. Card came up in default resolution as expected. I ran the install, and it's worked flawlessly since."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,hynix memory on evga lol,2018-02-28,Pros:performance is good unless you are unlucky and got a card with hynix memory like I didit's does run hot but not that much for single fan it's a pretty good cooling and it fits in my mini itx builds just fine,Cons:fans are loud under load like annoying loud (I read reviews saying fans were quiet haha I don't think they are quiet unless you are deaf just saying),Other Thoughts:I have 3 of these on builds but my very recent card has hynix memory prices went up for 300 to 359 and for what from micron to hynix downgrade lol ok evga I think it's time to switch to some other company now
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,These Video cards arent as fast as they use to be when it comes to mining Ether :(,2018-02-21,"Pros:Unfortunately, there isn't anything that I can say that's positive.  I spent way more than twice of what its worth and it underperformed others of the same make and model number!  Yes, there is a positive!  Now I know not to buy this model of video card anymore.","Cons:For whatever reason, Out of the box they only put out 15.3 MHs instead of 19.8 MHs when mining Ether, that's about 18% drop in MHs from previous cards of the exact same make and model?","Other Thoughts:Don't buy this card if you plan on using it for mining Ethereum, waste of good money.  If You're a gamer, it's probably fine, just expensive like all of the cards out there."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great product but the fan is indeed loud!,2018-02-18,Pros:Great performance for the price!Very small will fit in any tower that's for sure.Replace my GTX 760 2GB and I definitely see a big difference. Most game can be played on Ultra and High settingsBF1 is between high and UltraPUBG is mostly on ultra and some very low setting like foliage XD helps u see the sneakers in the bushFallout 4 ultra all the wayYou get the idea !,Cons:Fan was ok at first but after a few weeks it started to be loudly noticeable! But only when playing games it does!I just put my headset or put the music louder on speakerMy towers' fans were already loud but that just beats it !Maybe I would have bought the double fans gc instead but you just get used to it !,"Other Thoughts:If you have an old geezer card like mine was with 2GB, I definitely recommend you buying this card you won't regret it!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing little card,2018-02-15,"Pros:-Runs very quietly, even under load-High framerates in every game I play-Low power consumption-Small size",Cons:-Runs a little hot due to single-fan design-Not a 1080 Ti,None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,One of the best cards I've had,2018-01-29,"Pros:-Small length, only 6.8 inches, so it leaves space inside the case. (I'm using a Phanteks P400)-6GB, better than 3GB for graphic-intensive games-Easy to install-Mine came with an EVGA poster, thanks EVGA","Cons:-Noticably loud during intensive gaming, (Can't really hear it whenever I have my headphones in, so it doesn't bother me.)",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Smitten,2018-01-25,"Pros:Luckily I got one of these when They where $275,at it's Current Price, it would have been out of My Budget...I Love this Card, it Plays all My Games Smooth Like Butter, at 60 FPS...it's Twice the Card My Old GTX~960 was,EVGA has been Good to Me...","Cons:if I find any, I'll let You Know,(Current Price is more than Twice what I Paid for it)...","Other Thoughts:Games I Play:Fallout 3/ Fallout NV/ Fallout 4<==GodRays off, (Because I don't Like them)SkyRim SETomb Raider AnniversaryWorld of WarcraftDiablo II/ Diablo IIILegend of GrimRock I~II(Noteworthy, I Play at 1440x900 Resolution)System Specs:Asus 970 970 PRO GAMING/AURAAMD FX~8350EVGA GTX 1060 SC 6Gb32Gb DDR3512Gb SSD3Tb HDD"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing card but giving me some issues,2018-01-24,Pros:This card eats every game I play with ease. PUBG runs great maxed out at 1080. I don't really have any intense games but i'm really happy with what it can handle for me. For only having one fan it stays pretty cool and the factory over clocking is really nice.,"Cons:Whenever I start my PC cold, I get multiple issues. Sometimes one of my monitors is at 800x600 while the other is at the native. Sometimes one screen is black and the other has artifacts, and usually neither screen has any picture. When I hit the reset button, both screens come back just fine.It's not a terrible issue but it shouldn't be happening and I'm worried it's a precursor to the card failing down the road.","Other Thoughts:It's a little loud when games are running, but with headphones on who cares?If I wasn't getting the display errors this card would be 5/5. I'm so glad I bought it before these insane price increases and shortages."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great buy for the price (this was when I bought the card),2018-01-23,"Pros:Small size, low power, pretty good performance",Cons:Price increases since I bought the card,"Other Thoughts:I bought this card for my son just a month ago and a month later it is 2x the price.  I'm saying it now, unless this changes, this will end PC gaming as we know it.  I bought my 1070 almost 3 years ago for $429 and today that same card is nearly $1,000.  This is to nVidia and AMD:  you guys might like the prices now, but keep in mind game developers are looking at the future and if I'm a developer, I'm building my company around consoles and maybe porting a stripped-down version to the pc.Consoles can skirt the cryptocurrency wars by having their GPUs built directly for them so that only their products can use them.  That keeps the prices down.  I do see console prices going up to reflect GPU price increases, but not the 100% markup I've seen over the last month with discrete cards.  This has been going on for 2 years now so if this doesn't stop soon, PC gaming is dead.  No way would I ever buy a 1060 for the prices they are fetching now.  My son would have to make due with the 670 he had and just turn down settings.I said this when CUDA first arrived that I could see video cards costing thousands because the performance of a typical video card today is far, far, far, far more powerful than even the best servers CPUs.  I worried even then that video cards would be the new CPU where code developers used the GPU to run everything from servers to crunching algorithms (like password breaking)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great if it keeps its drivers,2018-01-22,"Pros:Great for 1080p gaming, 200+ fps on Counterstrike, 70+ fps on Playerunkown and sorta good for mining.",Cons:My device manager seems to always give code 43 whenever I try to boot up Garry's Mod and It gives me a Microsoft Basic Render Driver whenever I boot up Insurgency.

During heavy tasks the single fan can get quiet noisy. I somewhat fixed this by limiting my clock speed and not letting my card boost so high.

T,Cons:None so far after 30+ days of use.,"Other Thoughts:his is a siginificant upgrade to my AMD Radeon 6870 1GB card. I was in CrossFire set up, but so few games actually take advantage of that and then one of the two cards died. Was relying on just the 1 Radeon for a while til its fan died. I had actually replaced the fan on the other card that died a few years ago. Anyway, rather than replace the fan (again), I opted to just bight the bullet and get the card. Completely worth it and has played all games I throw at it without breaking a sweat (Skryim, Total War franchise games, DOOM)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performer.  Loud by Default,2017-12-15,Pros:- Performs as it should.- Small profile with respectable cooling performance.- Great customer service from EVGA.,"Cons:The default fan curve is a bit too aggressive for my tastes.  Fan speeds ramp up to 50+% before the card even hits 70C and it can be pretty loud.  This is easily remedied if you use MSI Afterburner or other control software.  Once I made those adjustments, the card was much quieter with only a couple of degrees increase in temperature.  Other than that, I have no issues with this card.",None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,A bit finicky but still amazing,2017-12-03,"Pros:Extremely powerful for its price (Able to run DOOM on Ultra with no issues)Small, so it fits effectively every form factor MOBO (aside from ITX)","Cons:Mine had a weird incident where it became unrecognized by Windows though I believe this was due to the 11/30/2017 driver update NVIDIA put out as I had no issues until the day after I'd applied it. This required me to run off integrated graphics (or a separate GPU if you lack integrated graphics), uninstall the card through device manager, then reinstall after shut down.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card!,2017-12-03,Pros:- Great performance.- Small size fits in most cases and enclosures.- Reasonably priced.,Cons:- Noisy out of the box. It's very quiet until the fan speed reaches 50% speed.,"Other Thoughts:For anyone complaining about the noisy fan, use MSI after burner or any kind of overclocking tool and set the fan profile to quiet mode, or manually set the fan speed to 50% max. The gpu temp will increase to mid 80s, but the fan noise is pretty much inaudible."

I currently have a total of 24 video cards mining.The heatsink design on this card is much more efficient than it's competitors.  I also purchased the 3GB version of the EVGA 1060, and here's how they perform:Out of the box mining Zcash with EWBF miner (stock settings):1060 6GB - 325H/s @ 65C1060 3GB - 280 H/s @ over 85CWith the GPU clock at 2050(ish - it varies a little while running) and MEM clock at about 4500.1060 6GB - 330-340 H/s1060 3GB - 300-305 H/sIn conclusion, this card runs about 10-15% faster out of the box, and is at least 20C cooler while doing it.  I see complaints about the fan, but I'm not seeing it here.  These run literally all day long, OC'd, and none of them ever even approach 70C, and I have yet to see one running at over 50% fan speed to keep them that cool.","Cons:Because of idiot miners like me, these cost more than they should.  No cons about the card itself.  Again, this thing is fantastic!","Other Thoughts:Buy it.  For gaming, for 3D modeling, or for mining.  You won't regret it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card when you're limited on space,2017-11-16,"Pros:Great card, runs everything well. Never goes above 70 degrees. Silent operation on most games.",Cons:The fan is very noticeable on games such Overwatch and Battlefield 1.,"Other Thoughts:Definitely recommend this card for those that are limited on space. It would be nice if the fan was quieter on games that push the card. Given the performance, I would buy again."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge perfomance in a small package,2017-11-16,"Pros:Small form factor, Well built solid card, Easy to install, ""Worked in my NON-UEFI Motherboard"", Very Quiet, Low power usage, Very low temps, Came with excellent software package for easy driver installations and game setting optimizations As well as Precision-XOC for effortless overclocking, Came with a poster, stickers and a badge to show off your love for EVGA and Nvidia.","Cons:After installing on windows 10 i could not open nvidia control panel, it would say there was no Nvidia graphics card installed. Had me worried at first. I had to dig around a bit, not much though, I find out it was disabled in windows device manager by default. I don't know if this is a windows 10 issue or if this is done to avoid driver or other issues, so it might not really be a con as this might not be the case for everyone. But right-clicking the card in device manager and selecting enabled did the trick.","Other Thoughts:Shipping was amazing, only 2-days ground domestic, and was packaged very well both by Newegg and EVGA.

What a difference, I can't even put into words how much. Even with my older hardware this changed gaming for me i a big way. I am so happy i decided to go with EVGA. I used to be a AMD\ATI guy but this has affected me so much, I could never go back. I would definitely recommend this product. Do yourself a favor buy this card. 6GB is worth the extra $."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Terrific graphics card!,2017-11-15,"Pros:-Very simple to set up, configure and install-Runs most all old games at ultra settings, and new games at high and ultra settings at 1080p, as well as 1440-Quiet, efficient and well designed","Cons:- Some of the software that allows clocking configuration has a bit of a learning curve and isn't entirely intuitive, but with some practice it makes sense.",Other Thoughts:Highly recommend. The perfect high-end card for those on a budget.  Performance is superb
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card,2017-11-15,"Pros:Great performance for a small factor card, quiet and cool. Full load temps @ 60deg with fan at 50 percent.",Cons:None that I can think of.,"Other Thoughts:At first I wasn't too sure about this card but shen it went on sale, I decided what the heck. My main concern was if the single fan was going to be enough to keep the card cool at full load. To my surprise it does but I think that it helps that I've got a case with 5 fans running."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nvidia still makes a great product,2017-11-05,Pros:Easy installNvidia reliability and featuresBeautiful and well performing,Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:A very strong card. I don't game nearly as much as I used to, but I have noticed I've been playing more and more after building a new rig a couple months ago.Been on a GTX 550ti for years (still works, still a relatively good card) in an old box with all outdated tech and it was really unenjoyable. I chalked it up to me getting older and not caring as much but actually it was because I didn't realize just how horrible the experience was.Anyway, the card is great and I just ordered a new 24"" 144hz 1ms IPS to compliment it. Been on an old 21"" 60hz TN for quite a while and believe if you have a card this great, might as well get as much as possible out of it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent,2017-11-03,"Pros:- Fast card, can play any games I play at highest settings 1080p (Fortnite, Overwatch, PUBG, etc.)- Quiet. Fan turns off when idle during cool temps. Automatically turns on and adjusts RPM under load.- Small, fits in my mATX case very well and leaves plenty of room for other things.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card for the money,2017-10-14,"Pros:- Much better single fan cooling solution then the non SC EVGA card.- Plays everything at 1080, you'll have to turn down settings if you want to support a 144hz monitor though.- Can barely hear it running.",Cons:- It's not a 1080 Ti.,Other Thoughts:Using the standard shipping this took about a week to get to me in Edmonton from BC. Yey Canada post.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid entry mining card,2017-10-14,Pros:Really great card if you are looking to start doing crypto mining. Stock rates for Ether are about 19MH/s and you can overclock to 22MH/s. You can even reduce the wattage down from 120W to 90W and still get 22MH/s.,Cons:none,None

Comes pretty close though!,Other Thoughts:I've had this card now for about 3 months and I am beyond pleased. Worth every single penny. If you are looking at building a mid-range build with a single card then this is no doubt the card for you. This sucker packs a wallop and don't listen to the clowns that say you do not need 6GB VRAM and to go with the 3GB. I have already ran into a couple games that do indeed use up more than 3GB.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good gaming card,2017-10-13,Pros:- quiet- only one 6 pin pcie needed,Cons:- a little loud when fan at 100%,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Rock Solid as usual for EVGA,2017-10-09,Pros:-Quite-Powerful-Small-Load temps where fantastic,Cons:-If you want something pretty to look at through your case window might go for something else (maybe dual fan version)...?,"Other Thoughts:The stock specs put it at ""Core Clock 1607 MHz"" and a ""Boost Clock 1835 MHz"" but putting it under GPU load for hours, *my* card never got higher then 75c and stayed stable at 1925MHz under its own boost with no overclocking. Got really lucky with this card, it boosts farther and runs cooler then it seems most consumers have gotten. This is my *use case* situation and your mileage will vary, regardless its such a great card for the price.... IF that price can stay near is MSRP.... Or you can catch it on sale ;)I never noticed any real noise even at full load, custom fan profiles going above 60% fan is gonna make noise regardless though, and with a fan profile maxed at 100% it would boost to 1980 on it's own which is super impressive for the card.VR-StuffYes it can do VR and do it very nicely, keep in mind though its at the low end of VR. With it you can get started with and enjoy most VR games  (without SS being adjusted) and plays great. This card with a Ryzen 3 can get you a VR system for under $500-$600 which is way better then it was a year ago.Your standard games have enough articles and youtube videos on the subject but to simplify, Plays games at 1080p flawlessly with often high-epic settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good video card,2017-10-08,"Pros:- Good video card for the lowest model from 10xx- Not very noisy (my case is also silent so that helps)- You can tune it with software- Supports all types of features (nvshield, geforce optimizier, VR etc)",Cons:- Don't expect to run every new game on highest settings. I run WoW on 10 with FPS drops in raids sometimes.- Nothing else as cons. Pretty good video card overall for its prize,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Really good !,2017-09-27,"Pros:Love it , plug and play temps are good and really good fps",Cons:only 1 fan so when its get hot the fan make a good amount of sound,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great for 1080p Gaming. Maybe a Bit Overkill?,2017-09-27,Pros:-Running most games at high/ultra settings easily over 60 fps paired with an intel i5 4690 and 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz Ram. Feels good man.jpg.-Overclocked it over 2000Mhz clock speed and over 9000/4500Mhz VRAM. Not too shabby!,"Cons:-Really don't have any negative things to say, just nitpicks like:-No backplate to help mitigate the card drooping/warping from it's own weight.-More overhead for overclocking would be nice, though not sure if it's just my card though (silicon lottery).-The Price. I got this for ~$270 (minus S&H). Granted this is the SC version but still.","Other Thoughts:So out of curiosity and boredom, I enabled Nvidia's Dynamic Screen Resolution/DSR for 1440p and 4k resolutions. I ran Prey with 4k selected and most settings to high just to see what my system can handle (and a couple of features like motion blur disabled, vsync off, and AA at x2). What I got was ~30 FPS in the Shuttle Bay. Granted it's not native resolution, and there wasn't much going on, but still that was surprising to see. @1440p, I got around 70 fps with the same settings, so I think this card can handle it fairly well.The non SC version should work just fine as well, so if you want to save a bit of money you should get that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very solid card,2017-09-26,"Pros:Great Price-to-Performance Ratio.Not too big. People call it tiny, but it's not!Relatively quiet. Can get a little loud at fan speeds over 60 percent.",Cons:No back-plate!More CUDA cores would have made it truly great. 1200 plus is plenty but 1600 or 2000 would have been even better for professional applications.,"Other Thoughts:I have used this for mainly playing Arkham Knight at Ultra settings and it blew my mind but that is not my ultimate goal. My main focus was to use this for rendering in Maya and maybe compositing, but so far I've only used it a few times to model in Maya and did one single walk cycle with a dog and those are hardly stressing on the system and the graphics card. So the jury is still out on the professional capabilities of this card. If it performs at the same level as a 980 card, so I know it won't disappoint. At first I was going to get me a WX 3100 Radeon Pro card for 3d and animation but when I looked at the benchmarks and realized how much more powerful this was for a little more, I bought this. But I am hopeful it will hold up well. Considering that most people buy Radeon for value, this card currently makes any RX card pointless in a price to performance ratio, until this Ethereum business slows down and those RX cards go back to the prices they were when they first came out."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,stops computers from working,2017-09-21,Pros:nice graphics while it works very quite and compact,Cons:after about six months it stopped working and stopped my computer or any computer its plugged into from booting up,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Very Loud,2017-09-10,Pros:-Small: Fits into a mATX case with room to spare-Powerful: Almost as good as the 980 for a fraction of the price-Low Power: Only requiring one 6 pin PCI-E plug and 150 watts makes it a good upgrade without having to get a new PSU,Cons:-At 30% fan speed the temperature is above 80C yet the fan is somehow louder than the stock fx-8350 fan-At 90% fan speed the temperature is around 70C but the fan is so loud it can be heard through headphones,Other Thoughts:-If you can fit a bigger graphics card in your case I would suggest going with a two fan version of the card-Any fan speed over 30% sounds just as loud so you might as well go the full 90% in you want your card running any lower than 80C
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-08-31,"Pros:-Fast, plays overwatch at max at 90-130FPS-Works well with my AMD FX-8370-Can play any game I play at high to ultra settings",Cons:-Not a GTX 1080ti,None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Great card at a great price, but loud.  I regret not paying a little extra for a full-size and quieter card.",2017-08-03,"Pros:Some of the best price per performance, while leaning just a little into the ""more power"" area.Nvidia card for a G-Sync monitor.Every ATi card I ever had back in the day burned out, on one component or another.  Been rockin' Nvidia for years and years now with no issue.","Cons:This card is too loud for my tastes.  It's annoying.  Even over loud game audio on headphones.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy the small form card just to save a little bit of money (my case is massive; saving ~$20 was the only reason).Still, I will only dock it one egg because it's still a great card at a great price.","Other Thoughts:The REAL thing that drove me here was to do just a little bit to spread the word about the rebate cards EVGA is offering.  They give you a choice: check or debit card - choose the check.  I have yet to find a place that will accept the card, and I'm getting pretty aggravated with it.  I'd have paid $30 to not have to go through this hassle."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"This card is a beast!  Small, compact, 6-pin power, fast GPU!",2017-07-31,"Pros:Pros- small profile- 6-pin PCIe power- quiet fan- No need for OCing, fast out of the box, never exceeded 70C.- Takes load off your CPU, no more bottlenecking- 60-120 FPS every game ULTRA settings.- Vulkan API built in, frame rate doubled with DOOM 2016.- future proof with 6gb of ram- still super fast on old PC with PCIe 1.1","Cons:- No thermal pad on VRM but no problem with overheating, don't worry about it.- Geforce Experience Application is junk.  Had issues with drivers and kept crashing during latest update version.  Solution = rollback drivers, then reinstall update, choose custom install, check GPU Driver and PhysX only, check clean install.  Problem solved.  This is my only reason for giving it 4 stars.",Other Thoughts:This card has transformed my computer.  I'm running an older PC 2008 with dual 2.8ghz (8 core) CPUs (E5462).  My old graphics card R7 250X 1GB couldn't keep up.  The CPU kept bottle necking and the frames would drop.  I started to realized maybe my computer was too old or it was the graphics card.  Instead of building a new PC I bought the card first to see if it would make a difference and let me tell you this GPU is incredible!I used to struggle running DOOM 2016 and Battlefront.  I ran low graphics on everything and now since installing the EVGA 1060 SC 6GB I can run everything on ULTRA settings with min 60-120 FPS.  My computer no longer bottlenecks and it's like I have a brand new machine.

I got this as an exchange for a defective card, the model I sent back was out of stock when they were setting the exchange up. They offered me this card for the same price as the one I returned. It was the first and only time in 17 years that I returned an item to Newegg.I'm very happy with the card and Newegg's service. The card is overkill for me but I wasn't going to pass up a great deal on it and it will be in my system for at least the next 4 years just like my last one. I don't upgrade as much as I used to because I don't play as many games as I used to, as in I hardly play any now.",Cons:None.,None

It happens every time and I am extremely disappointed.,Other Thoughts:I spent $250 on a card that doesn't work but for about 10 minutes of gaming...
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great thermals and no clearance issues.,2017-07-11,"Pros:The size of this card was the most influential part of buying this card. Another factor is that i have seen it go to about $230 ( after rebate) . It also overclocks extremely well, i got it to do a 300 mhz  without changing anything else and just left it cause im not to experienced with overclocking and it stays under 60 c the whole time after hours of gaming. And the ambient temps are 77-79 F ( side panel off) .","Cons:From what i have seen i will say that the rx 580 outperforms the 1060, but if you really want some of the features of geforce experience or your case doesn't fit a standard  sized card ( because all of the rx 580 on the market now are about 9 inches or bigger) or you are a green team fan boy then go with the 1060.","Other Thoughts:If you buy a 3gb version than you cannot call it a true 1060, more like a 1055 ti. just buy the 6gb version instead of making your system ram do your gpus job. But consider the rx 580 even if you despise the people who make mini little silicon ovens over at amd."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2017-06-30,Pros:- strong enough to handle most anything I throw at it.- video memory to spare.- despite being a single fan it runs fairly cool. Only hits 55c running Forza Horizon 3.- insanely quiet.- lower power draw than my previous card.- small form factor.,Cons:- the steadily climbing price.- had to fiddle a little bit with bios settings to get it working properly with my motherboard. Enabling the PCI legacy mode did the trick.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Eh, it's OK",2017-06-28,"Pros:Pre overclocked is good, decent performance for such a stubby little card, cooler seems effective enough for me.","Cons:GeForce Experience is an awful disaster, for some reason cs go runs like horribly shutter sputter 15-25 fps.","Other Thoughts:I got it before the major price hike. Don't install GFE well you have to to get the free game but get rid out it after. Like I said cs go runs horribly but Just Cause 3 runs great so the card isn't defective it's something wrong with cs go. I have both the Rx 580 8GB and this GTX1060 6GB my old card was R9 280x 3GB, the 580/1060 really are the new mid level cards for 1080p.Temps and noise aren't too bad very cool ambient 66-68f  %100 load runs 65c fan %51, warm room 72f+ the card ramps up the fan to try and keep it no more than 70c so it gets a little loud but not as loud as an old single fan HD6870 I have.Over all it's an interesting little card, if you get it for a reasonable price it's fine and realize that a single fan card is a little louder than dual and triple fan cards it's just common sense."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-06-26,"Pros:- Very powerful for it's size.- Great quality, you can tell it's a great quality card just by it's weight.  It's pretty heavy for it's size.- Plays all my games on ultra setting in 1080p at >60FPS.","Cons:- People have complained about the noise of the fan, but I can't hear mine at all with it running at full load.  I think it's because I have great air flow in my case, so it doesn't get hot enough for the fan to ramp up.  So in other words, so con's for me.","Other Thoughts:I'll be honest, when I first saw this card, I immediately disregarded it because of it's size.  I wanted a full size SSC or a card with at least 2-fans.  But with the prices going up on the other cards right now, I had no choice but to purchase this card.  Well, I have no regrets what-so-ever.  This card runs cool, and performs absolutely amazing.  I love it, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a powerful graphics card at a good price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice card,2017-06-24,Pros:- small- 6-pin power connector- 50-100% better fps vs GTX 660 while also moving graphics from medium-high to ultra,"Cons:dvi -> display-port adapters don't work, if your running dual dvi use a dvi to hdmi adapter.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic. Runs cool and super stable.,2017-06-20,Pros:Great mid range card. Runs pretty much everything I throw at it at over 100 FPS on Ultra settings. Super easy install.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:If you want a card that will run everything on Ultra for the next 2 or 3 years you got your card right here.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-06-17,Pros:Very powerful for it's price,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card, especially for it's price to performance ratio."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Product! Love EVGA Products,2017-05-05,Pros:- Stays cool- easy install-comes with a nice program that keeps track of fan speed and heat ext...,Cons:-fan can be loud at times,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great video card,2019-02-14,Pros:-awesome performance for the price-evga warranty/support,Cons:-none,Other Thoughts:Card is a couple years old now but has performed flawlessly in that time. No complaints at all and EVGA is always the best for customer service if there is ever a problem.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"This card is really a great gaming video card; it's super fast, easy to setup, complarably small in lenght, and I would highly recommend it as well as Newegg as the seller!!!",2019-01-19,"Pros:it's small in length, super fast, and easy to setup..",Cons:none!!,Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend it as well as Newegg as the seller!!!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great,2019-01-08,Pros:SizePrice,Cons:No backplateNot great for overclocking,"Other Thoughts:Bought this for a friends build with a 2200g and it gets about 100fps on fort at ultra. Very quiet, great price and aesthetically pleasing."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very nice card and best P/C,2018-12-22,"Pros:Good price: Bought for 329.99$ plus 20$ MIR, and also have a free Monster Hunter: World comes as a gift from Nvidia.Proper performance: A default frequency from 1607-1835, which is the best among all 1060 products, which helps run well on my games such as World of Warships, PUBG, Watchdog, Just Cause 3, etc.Perfect size for any build.Better energy consumption compared with RX 580 or 590.Nice EVGA boost software, easy access and easy usage.",Cons:Not that much strong compared with 20 series and also the brand new RTX 2060 is coming early 2019.,"Other Thoughts:Suggest this card for less than CDN 360$.BTW, I love Newegg, saves me a lot from Quebec."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great Performance but the fan stop working,2018-12-17,Pros:- Great for last games in 1080p- Quiet,"Cons:After 1 year, the fan break.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Fits in my MicroATX build,2018-12-16,Pros:Short. You get good value with all the heat pipes. Overclocked. The fan is off until it needs it. Faster than I need.,Cons:The manual is poor. It's generic and for many different models. Included poster isn't as cool as I would expect. Bundled game cannot be resold and is Windows only. Playing the game requires creating accounts on NVidia and Steam.The card is as tall as the spec. allows and the 6-pin power connector comes out the top.,Other Thoughts:Tom's Hardware describes a modification you can make to the heat sink.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good small form 1060,2018-12-13,Pros:Perform great on mini ITX form factor,Cons:So far so good,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2018-12-02,Pros:Card works great and most of my games work on Max settings coupled with my old reliable FX8350 and 32 GB of Ram.,Cons:No complaints,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice Card,2018-12-01,Pros:Small sizeEasy to installcheaper than local market priceLow power consumptionOverclock version3 year warranty,Cons:Not a double-fan versionNo backplate,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good quality powerful card,2018-11-30,"Pros:Quality build, powerful, quiet and cool",Cons:Had problems booting but fixed now,"Other Thoughts:This is a great card. Cool, quiet, well made and powerful. Great buy. Got it for 209."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,Couldnt get to work,2018-11-29,Pros:Looks nice and is small,"Cons:Could not get it to work in windows 10. Windows was very unstable and would crash everytime about 10 minutes after boot. Tried reinstalling windows still wouldnt work. Tried to download drivers but could not because windows would crash. Couldnt find a fix so I threw it in the trash.  Put back in my old card, system works great.","Other Thoughts:I dont know, it would not work, didnt seem damaged. But i just cant deal with this many problems. A gpu today should be plug and play, or at least tell you what is the problem."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card with only one real annoyance,2018-11-23,"Pros:Excellent performance, paired with a great price.","Cons:Having only one hdmi port and three display ports is a bit bizarre to me, and unfortunately I am going to need a secondary hdmi port, so I'll need to buy a converter. Again, just kind of an annoyance, but the rationale kind of racks my brain.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great performance for price, very quiet",2018-11-20,"Pros:- Very quiet, fan doesn't even turn on below around 58 C, and I haven't seen the temp go above 70 C yet.- Easy to install, small enough for many PCs if upgrading- Better performance than I expected. Good FPS in Cities Skylines on near-max settings (uses 4-5 GB of the GPU RAM).- Requires only a moderate power supply (it says 400 W minimum in manual)",Cons:- None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product for the price.,2018-11-18,Pros:-Fast-Small-Relatively quiet-Only requires a single 6-pin PCIe power-Has the firmware that doesn't shut down the fan-About 10-15% faster than the EVGA 970 SSC,"Cons:-I payed MSRP.-It won't make me a cup of coffee in the morning nor give me a hug when I'm feeling blue.-I think it's dying...every now and then, (no real rhyme or reason) the screen will fill up with a pattern of faint white dots and streaks.  This may last for a few seconds up to several minutes, then everything will be fine again.Edit:  It was the monitor that was dying.","Other Thoughts:I bought this to replace my EVGA 970 SSC which went to my little sister. I wanted something that was a little more power efficient and had a little more oomph. It certainly met up with my expectations, aside from the minor nagging problems with the patterning on the screen. Power consumption in gaming with my core i7 4790K rarely exceeds 200W at the wall."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card for it's price and size,2018-11-17,Pros:-had it for almost a year and no problems-great cooling for a single fan-fairly quiet-love the double ball bearing fan,Cons:-none yet.,Other Thoughts:-definitely would buy again if I had to
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card,2018-11-12,Pros:Limited volume (not too long)Only (1) 6 pin connectorWorks great on in a Dell XPS w/460W PSPriced well with rebate,Cons:None yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,works as expected,2018-11-11,Pros:works as expected. great product. competitive price. thank you.,Cons:n/a,Other Thoughts:n/a
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Good card, but slightly noisy fan",2018-10-22,"Pros:Easy to set up - plugged it in, turned PC on, ran NVidia graphics driver updater, done.Small - looks like it would fit in just about any PC (but check with the manufacturer before cramming it in a mITX case)Powerful - this card has more than enough power to play anything I want (though I only have a 60Hz 1080p screen). I'm glad I went with the 6GB version over the 3, since it's not much more expensive.","Cons:I think this is typically of all single-fan powerful cards, but you can almost always hear that fan going, especially under load. It's not like, really loud, but you can definitely hear it over any of the other noises in your computer. If you've got the dough, I'd get a double-fan version. But if you're on a budget and/or you don't mind a little fan noise, it's not too bad.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Buy this card from Newegg,2018-10-04,"Pros:- Small factor- Fans do not go over 1300rmp under load and are silent- 22 C idle; low 60's when playing games- Evga has great customer support, which alone is worth it","Cons:- Got this card locally cause I couldn't wait for delivery.. big mistake. Card was running 45C idle, and 80C under load. Fan was going 2800 rpm and sounding like a leaf blower. I couldn't play games even with my open ear headphones on.","Other Thoughts:Local retailer CanadaComputers didn't want to replace the card under 14 day replacement warranty, they said it is final sale (contrary to what is stated on the product page). Did RMA with EVGA 2 days later I got a new card that is running great.Kinda wish that I got the proper card the first time around, but still cannot take an egg off."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great video card!,2018-09-06,"Pros:Well built....small, compact, stays cool and works great!",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Works great with my MSI Z370 M5 Gaming MB!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful but NOISEY,2018-09-04,Pros:Far exceeds my expectations. Runs everything I've thrown at it with Ultra/Extreme settings.,"Cons:LOUD when running bigger games. Seriously.. You might think a miniature jet is taking off from your computer. Not enough to take a star off, but something to keep in mind if you want a silent rig.","Other Thoughts:From all the research I've done, this card is the very best price to performance value at the moment.EDIT: After close to a year of use, this thing is still going strong and performing so much better than I ever expected."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It does what it does and does it well,2018-08-21,"Pros:Out of the box, it posts decent temps and isn't a power hog. Farcy 5 on all ultra settings w/a few modifications to bump up frame rates; ditto for Battlefront 2 and the Wolfenstein titles. It benchmarks decent FPS numbers in 1080p settings. I got this a entry/mid level build for my rig since I'm still pretty new at PC building, so this gave me what I desired at the time. I wasn't expecting blazing 4K gaming or was going to demand 3D rendering that a 1080 Ti would do without breaking a sweat.  I've been learning as I go with overclocking and this thing sure has taken a beating and hasn't quit yet.","Cons:There are some comments, but nothing that would make me take an egg/star away.  Tends to get a bit warm (75-77c) when overclocked, but that could also just have been the small form factor and just normal for a single fan card. I also didn't play with the fan curve. I kind of was hoping the ""EVGA GEFORCE..."" lettering on the side was LED, but it's not. Not many people like that, but I do. No backplate for bling or heat dissipation. XOC desn't allow for much tweaking with this model GPU, which I guess is understandable for an entry/mid level card.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to someone. Just don't expect it to give you gtx 1080 FPS or get blown away with 4K graphics. Only two things I'd change would be to give it a backplate and that cool LED light for the lettering on the side. Other than that, it's a solid buy."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Quality product.,2018-08-10,Pros:Great performance.Super quiet.Convenient size for MT builds.,Cons:None so far.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,RMA'd twice,2018-08-09,Pros:- Runs well for 1060- Lowish heat output,"Cons:- My first card (brand new) broke after 4 months of use, it fans stopped spinning and black screen on post.- My 2nd card (refurbed one they sent me via RMA) broke after 1 year, DVI port stopped working and eventually card stopped output","Other Thoughts:I'm not sure, when this card works, it works very well for the price point, but I've gone through TWO of them in 2 years and I'm not overclocking, they have proper cleaning/air cooling, etc.... The RMA process is a nightmare for Australia to Taiwan office because they never pick up the phone (english, if you select Chinese they pick up immediately).A bit bummed because I've already spent 100$ in postage sending the RMA's back to the warehouse which means I could have bought a 1070 at this point.  I asked for a different card and both times they've sent me refurbed models that seem to break.My warranty is almost at the 3 year point and I'm afraid this 3rd card will break and I'll be out of luck.This is my 4th EVGA card in my lifetime (25+ years of gaming) and it might be my last sad to say. :("
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,This thing performs like crazy!!,2018-08-06,Pros:Runs really strong and decently cool. Sits around 65°c at full throttle.,Cons:It could look a little better.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this as kind of a filler until I could get a 1080ti or the next generation gpu when they come out. Now that I've got it and overclocked it, I don't know if I can justify upgrading. With all epic settings on Ark and some settings like shadows and sky effects turned down, I'm getting anywhere from 50 to 100fps easily. It's definitely putting me in a hard spot to upgrade..."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Aye,2018-07-13,"Pros:-EVGA swag is undeniably cool.  (Love their customer service.)-1080p on 1092x1024?  No problemo! (I might be getting older - but - I'm content with monitor as it is.-I turned on V-Sync and kept it on.  This plays all the current AAA titles like butter on bread.)-Below $300-Efficient and compact, baby!  (There's nothing quite like being able to remove power cords from a case.)","Cons:-Might only last a couple years at max settings in certain titles, but coming from a 760GTX with a stock of games I'm still enjoying from this generation - I'm not too worried.   (My next big upgrade will probably finally lift me off from the x58/1366 chipset.  Until then I have plenty left in this rig to get me by and so will you.)","Other Thoughts:It's louder, but not annoyingly so.  I was worried it'd be a jet turbine on liftoff compared to my dual-fan solution.   I haven't OC'd or messed with settings, but I hear it has some further potential there, too."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Its EVGA, don't think twice",2018-07-04,"Pros:Tiny card, packs a punch",Cons:its not a 1080ti,Other Thoughts:This thing is screaming to get cranked out with VR. Runs beautifully and does a whole lot of work while fitting more than comfortably in a mid-sized case. For someone who wouldn't typically overclock the SC does just fine.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Pretty beefy card for the price/size.,2018-07-02,Pros:It was pretty plug and play. Update the drivers on this baby beast and ride the dragon. It plays all my games at max setting and looks great doing it.,"Cons:Idk, I guess a con is that it's not a 1080?",Other Thoughts:I do recommend this little guy. It's compact and awesome.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Small, Tasty Card",2018-06-28,Pros:Good speed and quality you expect to get from EVGANice dust covers for ports that are not being used.,"Cons:It is an ""older"" technologyConstantly sold out (but that is because it sells fast)",Other Thoughts:The fan isn't THAT loud. I've never come across a system or component that was truly silent or quiet.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful little card,2018-06-27,"Pros:Its a small, powerful card.  1080p Gaming this is a card i'd recommened as long as your willing to turn down some settings sometimes to keep the frame rate up.","Cons:While small is a pro, its also a con in this case.  The small heatsink and fan make the card rev up a bit to stay cool.  Runs warmer unless you set a fan speed profile yourself to a higher level.",Other Thoughts:Good card all around.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great GPU,2018-06-23,"Pros:- Easy Install- Idles at 40, and under max load it's usually 69-71- Runs all my games on ultra between 60 - 150 fps (Modded Skyrim / Fallout 4, Doom, GTA V, Tetris, Pong)- No Coil Whine or other problems","Cons:- A bit more expensive than it used to be, but neither Newegg or EVGA are at fault for it obviously. $350 after taxes isn't bad for what I needed.- Fan is pretty loud when running games at Ultra with high frame rates, but it doesn't bother me because I wear headphones. It may be irritating to some people.","Other Thoughts:My first graphics card was a GT 660 (which could do little to nothing) and then I upgraded to a GTX 750 Ti (which could play old games like Portal and Bioshock), and finally upgraded to this. I had upgraded every other part of my PC but never got around to the GPU until now. To be honest, my main dream was to play modded Skyrim without going under 60fps, and this card was exactly what I needed. A little late for Skyrim hype, huh?The only reason not to recommend this card is the fan noise, but if you wear headphones like me, you won't notice it. I'm very satisfied with this GPU."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very Pleased,2018-05-18,Pros:Easy InstallFeels sturdy (some of the long 2 and 3 fan cards can feel too flexible)Nice upgrade for this PC (from an R9 380x that died)Low power consumption.,Cons:Price (but that's all graphics cards re; cryptomining),Other Thoughts:Replaced a dead card on the Frankenstein PC (made up of other PCs parts). So far works great and is a noticeable upgrade.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It's great!,2018-04-28,"Pros:- I got this for 380 cad when it was on sale, it's a good card, it's small and compact, which is a bonus. bigger doesn't always mean better, this card performs really well even though it has 1 fan.- Can run battlefield 4 ultra in 120+ fps- Can run battlefield 1 ultra in 90+ frames- Can run fortnite ultra / high in 150 - 250 frames- Since it's 6gb it can serve you in the long run, it also future proofs it as new games will eventually consume more vram.",Cons:- Everything is fine so far.,"Other Thoughts:- Would recommend to people who would like to play on high / ultra, because this card can handle high settings.- Overall a great card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good card,2018-04-28,Pros:PerformanceBrand6 GBSmall size,Cons:High price right now,Other Thoughts:This card performs well and had 6 gb which is great for future proof. It is also small so it will fit most cases. EVGA is a good brand for video cards and well recommended. If you can find better price go ahead. You have to check everywhere and do price match when available to save a bit. I got mine under 400 cdn. I remove a star for the high price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product! High Price.,2018-04-25,Pros:Everything works fine and it is a great GPU,Cons:The inflated prices from cryptocurrency are a bit sad.,Other Thoughts:I bought this around Christmas and its still going strong.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing graphics,2018-04-16,"Pros:I’ve never been able to play a game on ultra settings with solid 100 FPS and no frame drop. Amazing. Really feels like this piece of hardware was put together well, somethings you can just feel in your hands and know it’s not cheaply made.",Cons:The price made me want to throw up but I bought it anyway. Lol this thing is LOUD under load. Sounds like your PC is about to get ready for liftoff as soon as you start gaming. Maybe the loudest I’ve ever heard for single fan GPU.,"Other Thoughts:Installation was cake. EVGA XOC software is somewhat confusing but manageable. I recommend checking out the fan speed settings, options are quiet mode etc. The card runs hot normally hence the high fan speeds even with good air flow in the case. Check your temps and maybe game with headphones. The only time the fan kicks into tornado mode is under ultra settings in games. Oh yeah I wish the crypto people would go away so gaming gpu prices can be reasonable again.Cheers"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card choice for less money,2018-04-15,Pros:I have used this card since it was released and I have not been let down. I have gone head to head with other flagship cards like the 1080ti and I had better performance. This card boosts up to 2113MHz if it is liquid cooled and stays under 25 degrees Celsius. This card has no problem handling 4K resolution without a significant drop in fps.,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a good quality card like the 1080ti but don't have the money, then this card is for you."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic!,2018-04-06,Pros:-Runs Nearly everything on 1080p ultra-Low power consumption-Several EVGA programs and Nvidia program accessibility,Cons:-No VGA port,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,THE MIGHTY MEGA mini MACHINE,2018-03-14,Pros:Can run current gen games no problem.,Cons:4k Bottoms out a bit but that is expected. I run full 1080 Ultra everything on a 4K TV.,Other Thoughts:HUNT : Showdown almost at Full Settings no problem!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Easy 23MH for this card,2018-03-14,Pros:-Good for mining and gaming as well-Low power consumption and low noise,Cons:- Can't any find as of now any flaws,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance and a good price.,2018-03-10,"Pros:Excellent Performance. I was looking for a reasonably priced card that would play most games at no less than 60 fps at high settings. For the games played in my family, this has far exceeded those expectations.Price was competitive compared to other cards in the 1060 family. Nearest card with comparable specs and reviews was fifty bucks more.","Cons:None so far. I've been running it less than a week. If anything changes, I'll update the review.","Other Thoughts:Easy to install. The only problem I had was finding one of the 6-pin power cables for my modular PS.  Obviously, not a fault of the card. It came with a install DVD, but my rig has no player, so I had to download from GeForce's website. Easy to find, and no issues there. Card came up in default resolution as expected. I ran the install, and it's worked flawlessly since."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,hynix memory on evga lol,2018-02-28,Pros:performance is good unless you are unlucky and got a card with hynix memory like I didit's does run hot but not that much for single fan it's a pretty good cooling and it fits in my mini itx builds just fine,Cons:fans are loud under load like annoying loud (I read reviews saying fans were quiet haha I don't think they are quiet unless you are deaf just saying),Other Thoughts:I have 3 of these on builds but my very recent card has hynix memory prices went up for 300 to 359 and for what from micron to hynix downgrade lol ok evga I think it's time to switch to some other company now
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,These Video cards arent as fast as they use to be when it comes to mining Ether :(,2018-02-21,"Pros:Unfortunately, there isn't anything that I can say that's positive.  I spent way more than twice of what its worth and it underperformed others of the same make and model number!  Yes, there is a positive!  Now I know not to buy this model of video card anymore.","Cons:For whatever reason, Out of the box they only put out 15.3 MHs instead of 19.8 MHs when mining Ether, that's about 18% drop in MHs from previous cards of the exact same make and model?","Other Thoughts:Don't buy this card if you plan on using it for mining Ethereum, waste of good money.  If You're a gamer, it's probably fine, just expensive like all of the cards out there."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great product but the fan is indeed loud!,2018-02-18,Pros:Great performance for the price!Very small will fit in any tower that's for sure.Replace my GTX 760 2GB and I definitely see a big difference. Most game can be played on Ultra and High settingsBF1 is between high and UltraPUBG is mostly on ultra and some very low setting like foliage XD helps u see the sneakers in the bushFallout 4 ultra all the wayYou get the idea !,Cons:Fan was ok at first but after a few weeks it started to be loudly noticeable! But only when playing games it does!I just put my headset or put the music louder on speakerMy towers' fans were already loud but that just beats it !Maybe I would have bought the double fans gc instead but you just get used to it !,"Other Thoughts:If you have an old geezer card like mine was with 2GB, I definitely recommend you buying this card you won't regret it!"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing card but giving me some issues,2018-01-24,Pros:This card eats every game I play with ease. PUBG runs great maxed out at 1080. I don't really have any intense games but i'm really happy with what it can handle for me. For only having one fan it stays pretty cool and the factory over clocking is really nice.,"Cons:Whenever I start my PC cold, I get multiple issues. Sometimes one of my monitors is at 800x600 while the other is at the native. Sometimes one screen is black and the other has artifacts, and usually neither screen has any picture. When I hit the reset button, both screens come back just fine.It's not a terrible issue but it shouldn't be happening and I'm worried it's a precursor to the card failing down the road.","Other Thoughts:It's a little loud when games are running, but with headphones on who cares?If I wasn't getting the display errors this card would be 5/5. I'm so glad I bought it before these insane price increases and shortages."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great buy for the price (this was when I bought the card),2018-01-23,"Pros:Small size, low power, pretty good performance",Cons:Price increases since I bought the card,"Other Thoughts:I bought this card for my son just a month ago and a month later it is 2x the price.  I'm saying it now, unless this changes, this will end PC gaming as we know it.  I bought my 1070 almost 3 years ago for $429 and today that same card is nearly $1,000.  This is to nVidia and AMD:  you guys might like the prices now, but keep in mind game developers are looking at the future and if I'm a developer, I'm building my company around consoles and maybe porting a stripped-down version to the pc.Consoles can skirt the cryptocurrency wars by having their GPUs built directly for them so that only their products can use them.  That keeps the prices down.  I do see console prices going up to reflect GPU price increases, but not the 100% markup I've seen over the last month with discrete cards.  This has been going on for 2 years now so if this doesn't stop soon, PC gaming is dead.  No way would I ever buy a 1060 for the prices they are fetching now.  My son would have to make due with the 670 he had and just turn down settings.I said this when CUDA first arrived that I could see video cards costing thousands because the performance of a typical video card today is far, far, far, far more powerful than even the best servers CPUs.  I worried even then that video cards would be the new CPU where code developers used the GPU to run everything from servers to crunching algorithms (like password breaking)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great if it keeps its drivers,2018-01-22,"Pros:Great for 1080p gaming, 200+ fps on Counterstrike, 70+ fps on Playerunkown and sorta good for mining.",Cons:My device manager seems to always give code 43 whenever I try to boot up Garry's Mod and It gives me a Microsoft Basic Render Driver whenever I boot up Insurgency.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Evga gtx  1060 6GB SC,2017-12-23,Pros:Easy to installFits in almost any caseRuns games great!,Cons:The noise is the only con I've found. During heavy tasks the single fan can get quiet noisy. I somewhat fixed this by limiting my clock speed and not letting my card boost so high. I was seeing upwards of 2ghz and that's when the fan really ramped up.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card for the price.,2017-12-16,Pros:Not really willing to shell out a whole lot of money on my current set up which has an old Ivy Bridge i7. T,Cons:None so far after 30+ days of use.,"Other Thoughts:his is a siginificant upgrade to my AMD Radeon 6870 1GB card. I was in CrossFire set up, but so few games actually take advantage of that and then one of the two cards died. Was relying on just the 1 Radeon for a while til its fan died. I had actually replaced the fan on the other card that died a few years ago. Anyway, rather than replace the fan (again), I opted to just bight the bullet and get the card. Completely worth it and has played all games I throw at it without breaking a sweat (Skryim, Total War franchise games, DOOM)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performer.  Loud by Default,2017-12-15,Pros:- Performs as it should.- Small profile with respectable cooling performance.- Great customer service from EVGA.,"Cons:The default fan curve is a bit too aggressive for my tastes.  Fan speeds ramp up to 50+% before the card even hits 70C and it can be pretty loud.  This is easily remedied if you use MSI Afterburner or other control software.  Once I made those adjustments, the card was much quieter with only a couple of degrees increase in temperature.  Other than that, I have no issues with this card.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING 6GB,2017-12-05,"Pros:Stable 60+ FPS @ 1080P in most current games.Good looking cardSmall Size, fit in any case.","Cons:LOUD LOUD LOUD IT'S VERY NOISY AT FULL LOAD,And if you try to adjust fan speed ( with afterburner or EVGA Software ) it will result in more heat (70+ C).",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,A bit finicky but still amazing,2017-12-03,"Pros:Extremely powerful for its price (Able to run DOOM on Ultra with no issues)Small, so it fits effectively every form factor MOBO (aside from ITX)","Cons:Mine had a weird incident where it became unrecognized by Windows though I believe this was due to the 11/30/2017 driver update NVIDIA put out as I had no issues until the day after I'd applied it. This required me to run off integrated graphics (or a separate GPU if you lack integrated graphics), uninstall the card through device manager, then reinstall after shut down.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card!,2017-12-03,Pros:- Great performance.- Small size fits in most cases and enclosures.- Reasonably priced.,Cons:- Noisy out of the box. It's very quiet until the fan speed reaches 50% speed.,"Other Thoughts:For anyone complaining about the noisy fan, use MSI after burner or any kind of overclocking tool and set the fan profile to quiet mode, or manually set the fan speed to 50% max. The gpu temp will increase to mid 80s, but the fan noise is pretty much inaudible."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wonderful flexability,2017-12-03,Pros:-Preforms well overall-Keeps rather cool for a single fan GPU-Plenty of connections for multiple monitor setups,Cons:None,None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic video card!,2017-11-22,"Pros:DIsclaimer:  I use these for mining crypto coins, and am seeing these run 24/7 at max capacity.  I currently have a total of 24 video cards mining.The heatsink design on this card is much more efficient than it's competitors.  I also purchased the 3GB version of the EVGA 1060, and here's how they perform:Out of the box mining Zcash with EWBF miner (stock settings):1060 6GB - 325H/s @ 65C1060 3GB - 280 H/s @ over 85CWith the GPU clock at 2050(ish - it varies a little while running) and MEM clock at about 4500.1060 6GB - 330-340 H/s1060 3GB - 300-305 H/sIn conclusion, this card runs about 10-15% faster out of the box, and is at least 20C cooler while doing it.  I see complaints about the fan, but I'm not seeing it here.  These run literally all day long, OC'd, and none of them ever even approach 70C, and I have yet to see one running at over 50% fan speed to keep them that cool.","Cons:Because of idiot miners like me, these cost more than they should.  No cons about the card itself.  Again, this thing is fantastic!","Other Thoughts:Buy it.  For gaming, for 3D modeling, or for mining.  You won't regret it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card when you're limited on space,2017-11-16,"Pros:Great card, runs everything well. Never goes above 70 degrees. Silent operation on most games.",Cons:The fan is very noticeable on games such Overwatch and Battlefield 1.,"Other Thoughts:Definitely recommend this card for those that are limited on space. It would be nice if the fan was quieter on games that push the card. Given the performance, I would buy again."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge perfomance in a small package,2017-11-16,"Pros:Small form factor, Well built solid card, Easy to install, ""Worked in my NON-UEFI Motherboard"", Very Quiet, Low power usage, Very low temps, Came with excellent software package for easy driver installations and game setting optimizations As well as Precision-XOC for effortless overclocking, Came with a poster, stickers and a badge to show off your love for EVGA and Nvidia.","Cons:After installing on windows 10 i could not open nvidia control panel, it would say there was no Nvidia graphics card installed. Had me worried at first. I had to dig around a bit, not much though, I find out it was disabled in windows device manager by default. I don't know if this is a windows 10 issue or if this is done to avoid driver or other issues, so it might not really be a con as this might not be the case for everyone. But right-clicking the card in device manager and selecting enabled did the trick.","Other Thoughts:Shipping was amazing, only 2-days ground domestic, and was packaged very well both by Newegg and EVGA.

What a difference, I can't even put into words how much. Even with my older hardware this changed gaming for me i a big way. I am so happy i decided to go with EVGA. I used to be a AMD\ATI guy but this has affected me so much, I could never go back. I would definitely recommend this product. Do yourself a favor buy this card. 6GB is worth the extra $."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,small and great overclock,2017-11-15,"Pros:Small card, very good overclock on memory",Cons:Noisier than the 2 fan ones but still very good noise level,Other Thoughts:With more and more game going 4gb+ textures it's worth the extra cash to get the 6gb version!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Terrific graphics card!,2017-11-15,"Pros:-Very simple to set up, configure and install-Runs most all old games at ultra settings, and new games at high and ultra settings at 1080p, as well as 1440-Quiet, efficient and well designed","Cons:- Some of the software that allows clocking configuration has a bit of a learning curve and isn't entirely intuitive, but with some practice it makes sense.",Other Thoughts:Highly recommend. The perfect high-end card for those on a budget.  Performance is superb
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card,2017-11-15,"Pros:Great performance for a small factor card, quiet and cool. Full load temps @ 60deg with fan at 50 percent.",Cons:None that I can think of.,"Other Thoughts:At first I wasn't too sure about this card but shen it went on sale, I decided what the heck. My main concern was if the single fan was going to be enough to keep the card cool at full load. To my surprise it does but I think that it helps that I've got a case with 5 fans running."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nvidia still makes a great product,2017-11-05,Pros:Easy installNvidia reliability and featuresBeautiful and well performing,Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:A very strong card. I don't game nearly as much as I used to, but I have noticed I've been playing more and more after building a new rig a couple months ago.Been on a GTX 550ti for years (still works, still a relatively good card) in an old box with all outdated tech and it was really unenjoyable. I chalked it up to me getting older and not caring as much but actually it was because I didn't realize just how horrible the experience was.Anyway, the card is great and I just ordered a new 24"" 144hz 1ms IPS to compliment it. Been on an old 21"" 60hz TN for quite a while and believe if you have a card this great, might as well get as much as possible out of it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent,2017-11-03,"Pros:- Fast card, can play any games I play at highest settings 1080p (Fortnite, Overwatch, PUBG, etc.)- Quiet. Fan turns off when idle during cool temps. Automatically turns on and adjusts RPM under load.- Small, fits in my mATX case very well and leaves plenty of room for other things. I love smaller card for the better air flow also, this was one of my best choices.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 6GB EDITION,2017-10-22,"Pros:Pros:Small cardDecent clock speedSingle fan, but perfectly adequate for the cardNever goes over 70 degrees, except for heavy gamingLooks cool",Cons:Cons:Only had it a few weeks but nothing wrong as of right now,"Other Thoughts:If you are thinking about overclocking, or are running intense games or programs, consider a dual fan version such as the dual fan EVGA or the NVIDIA windforce edition"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card for the money,2017-10-14,"Pros:- Much better single fan cooling solution then the non SC EVGA card.- Plays everything at 1080, you'll have to turn down settings if you want to support a 144hz monitor though.- Can barely hear it running.",Cons:- It's not a 1080 Ti.,Other Thoughts:Using the standard shipping this took about a week to get to me in Edmonton from BC. Yey Canada post.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid entry mining card,2017-10-14,Pros:Really great card if you are looking to start doing crypto mining. Stock rates for Ether are about 19MH/s and you can overclock to 22MH/s. You can even reduce the wattage down from 120W to 90W and still get 22MH/s.,Cons:none,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Just wow,2017-10-14,"Pros:Plays ANY game at 1080p/60fps ultra settings in 2017.Aesthetically pleasing and colors match any build.Not that huge, bulky thing that takes up so much space in your case.Very quiet.",Cons:No backplate.No SLI supportCan't really do 1440p at 60fps across the board on ultra. Comes pretty close though!,Other Thoughts:I've had this card now for about 3 months and I am beyond pleased. Worth every single penny. If you are looking at building a mid-range build with a single card then this is no doubt the card for you. This sucker packs a wallop and don't listen to the clowns that say you do not need 6GB VRAM and to go with the 3GB. I have already ran into a couple games that do indeed use up more than 3GB.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good gaming card,2017-10-13,Pros:- quiet- only one 6 pin pcie needed,Cons:- a little loud when fan at 100%,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Rock Solid as usual for EVGA,2017-10-09,Pros:-Quite-Powerful-Small-Load temps where fantastic,Cons:-If you want something pretty to look at through your case window might go for something else (maybe dual fan version)...?,"Other Thoughts:The stock specs put it at ""Core Clock 1607 MHz"" and a ""Boost Clock 1835 MHz"" but putting it under GPU load for hours, *my* card never got higher then 75c and stayed stable at 1925MHz under its own boost with no overclocking. Got really lucky with this card, it boosts farther and runs cooler then it seems most consumers have gotten. This is my *use case* situation and your mileage will vary, regardless its such a great card for the price.... IF that price can stay near is MSRP.... Or you can catch it on sale ;)I never noticed any real noise even at full load, custom fan profiles going above 60% fan is gonna make noise regardless though, and with a fan profile maxed at 100% it would boost to 1980 on it's own which is super impressive for the card.VR-StuffYes it can do VR and do it very nicely, keep in mind though its at the low end of VR. With it you can get started with and enjoy most VR games  (without SS being adjusted) and plays great. This card with a Ryzen 3 can get you a VR system for under $500-$600 which is way better then it was a year ago.Your standard games have enough articles and youtube videos on the subject but to simplify, Plays games at 1080p flawlessly with often high-epic settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good video card,2017-10-08,"Pros:- Good video card for the lowest model from 10xx- Not very noisy (my case is also silent so that helps)- You can tune it with software- Supports all types of features (nvshield, geforce optimizier, VR etc)",Cons:- Don't expect to run every new game on highest settings. I run WoW on 10 with FPS drops in raids sometimes.- Nothing else as cons. Pretty good video card overall for its prize,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Really good !,2017-09-27,"Pros:Love it , plug and play temps are good and really good fps",Cons:only 1 fan so when its get hot the fan make a good amount of sound,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great for 1080p Gaming. Maybe a Bit Overkill?,2017-09-27,Pros:-Running most games at high/ultra settings easily over 60 fps paired with an intel i5 4690 and 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz Ram. Feels good man.jpg.-Overclocked it over 2000Mhz clock speed and over 9000/4500Mhz VRAM. Not too shabby!,"Cons:-Really don't have any negative things to say, just nitpicks like:-No backplate to help mitigate the card drooping/warping from it's own weight.-More overhead for overclocking would be nice, though not sure if it's just my card though (silicon lottery).-The Price. I got this for ~$270 (minus S&H). Granted this is the SC version but still.","Other Thoughts:So out of curiosity and boredom, I enabled Nvidia's Dynamic Screen Resolution/DSR for 1440p and 4k resolutions. I ran Prey with 4k selected and most settings to high just to see what my system can handle (and a couple of features like motion blur disabled, vsync off, and AA at x2). What I got was ~30 FPS in the Shuttle Bay. Granted it's not native resolution, and there wasn't much going on, but still that was surprising to see. @1440p, I got around 70 fps with the same settings, so I think this card can handle it fairly well.The non SC version should work just fine as well, so if you want to save a bit of money you should get that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very solid card,2017-09-26,"Pros:Great Price-to-Performance Ratio.Not too big. People call it tiny, but it's not!Relatively quiet. Can get a little loud at fan speeds over 60 percent.",Cons:No back-plate!More CUDA cores would have made it truly great. 1200 plus is plenty but 1600 or 2000 would have been even better for professional applications.,"Other Thoughts:I have used this for mainly playing Arkham Knight at Ultra settings and it blew my mind but that is not my ultimate goal. My main focus was to use this for rendering in Maya and maybe compositing, but so far I've only used it a few times to model in Maya and did one single walk cycle with a dog and those are hardly stressing on the system and the graphics card. So the jury is still out on the professional capabilities of this card. If it performs at the same level as a 980 card, so I know it won't disappoint. At first I was going to get me a WX 3100 Radeon Pro card for 3d and animation but when I looked at the benchmarks and realized how much more powerful this was for a little more, I bought this. But I am hopeful it will hold up well. Considering that most people buy Radeon for value, this card currently makes any RX card pointless in a price to performance ratio, until this Ethereum business slows down and those RX cards go back to the prices they were when they first came out."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,stops computers from working,2017-09-21,Pros:nice graphics while it works very quite and compact,Cons:after about six months it stopped working and stopped my computer or any computer its plugged into from booting up,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Very Loud,2017-09-10,Pros:-Small: Fits into a mATX case with room to spare-Powerful: Almost as good as the 980 for a fraction of the price-Low Power: Only requiring one 6 pin PCI-E plug and 150 watts makes it a good upgrade without having to get a new PSU,Cons:-At 30% fan speed the temperature is above 80C yet the fan is somehow louder than the stock fx-8350 fan-At 90% fan speed the temperature is around 70C but the fan is so loud it can be heard through headphones,Other Thoughts:-If you can fit a bigger graphics card in your case I would suggest going with a two fan version of the card-Any fan speed over 30% sounds just as loud so you might as well go the full 90% in you want your card running any lower than 80C
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-08-31,"Pros:-Fast, plays overwatch at max at 90-130FPS-Works well with my AMD FX-8370-Can play any game I play at high to ultra settings",Cons:-Not a GTX 1080ti,None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Great card at a great price, but loud.  I regret not paying a little extra for a full-size and quieter card.",2017-08-03,"Pros:Some of the best price per performance, while leaning just a little into the ""more power"" area.Nvidia card for a G-Sync monitor.Every ATi card I ever had back in the day burned out, on one component or another.

Do yourself a favor and don't buy the small form card just to save a little bit of money (my case is massive; saving ~$20 was the only reason).Still, I will only dock it one egg because it's still a great card at a great price.","Other Thoughts:The REAL thing that drove me here was to do just a little bit to spread the word about the rebate cards EVGA is offering.  They give you a choice: check or debit card - choose the check.  I have yet to find a place that will accept the card, and I'm getting pretty aggravated with it.  I'd have paid $30 to not have to go through this hassle."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"This card is a beast!  Small, compact, 6-pin power, fast GPU!",2017-07-31,"Pros:Pros- small profile- 6-pin PCIe power- quiet fan- No need for OCing, fast out of the box, never exceeded 70C.- Takes load off your CPU, no more bottlenecking- 60-120 FPS every game ULTRA settings.- Vulkan API built in, frame rate doubled with DOOM 2016.- future proof with 6gb of ram- still super fast on old PC with PCIe 1.1","Cons:- No thermal pad on VRM but no problem with overheating, don't worry about it.- Geforce Experience Application is junk.  Had issues with drivers and kept crashing during latest update version.  Solution = rollback drivers, then reinstall update, choose custom install, check GPU Driver and PhysX only, check clean install.  Problem solved.  This is my only reason for giving it 4 stars.",Other Thoughts:This card has transformed my computer.  I'm running an older PC 2008 with dual 2.8ghz (8 core) CPUs (E5462).  My old graphics card R7 250X 1GB couldn't keep up.  The CPU kept bottle necking and the frames would drop.  I started to realized maybe my computer was too old or it was the graphics card.  Instead of building a new PC I bought the card first to see if it would make a difference and let me tell you this GPU is incredible!I used to struggle running DOOM 2016 and Battlefront.  I ran low graphics on everything and now since installing the EVGA 1060 SC 6GB I can run everything on ULTRA settings with min 60-120 FPS.  My computer no longer bottlenecks and it's like I have a brand new machine.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"good card, runs well but having issues with fan and heat",2017-07-23,Pros:-runs 1080p 60fps quite well,"Cons:-either my s340 case or this 1060 was slightly defective because screwing in the card required me to bend the back of the case with considerable force-idle temps are usually fine, 40-50C but when playing gpu intensive games the card can go up to the high 70s and is very loud, almost like a small hair dryer in my case",Other Thoughts:-might look into liquid cooling this with the kraken g12
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING - 06G-P4-6163-KR,2017-07-19,"Pros:Small and fast, and I only paid $189 for it from Newegg back in the middle of June with free next day shipping. I got this as an exchange for a defective card, the model I sent back was out of stock when they were setting the exchange up. They offered me this card for the same price as the one I returned. It was the first and only time in 17 years that I returned an item to Newegg.I'm very happy with the card and Newegg's service. The card is overkill for me but I wasn't going to pass up a great deal on it and it will be in my system for at least the next 4 years just like my last one. I don't upgrade as much as I used to because I don't play as many games as I used to, as in I hardly play any now.",Cons:None.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,Acting Up,2017-07-14,Pros:Great GPU when it works.DayZ Standalone gets 150+ FPS on very high settings,Cons:I'll load up any game and then after roughly 10 minutes of gaming all of a sudden the GPU will crash and the fan will jump to 100% speed. It happens every time and I am extremely disappointed.,Other Thoughts:I spent $250 on a card that doesn't work but for about 10 minutes of gaming...
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great thermals and no clearance issues.,2017-07-11,"Pros:The size of this card was the most influential part of buying this card. Another factor is that i have seen it go to about $230 ( after rebate) . It also overclocks extremely well, i got it to do a 300 mhz  without changing anything else and just left it cause im not to experienced with overclocking and it stays under 60 c the whole time after hours of gaming. And the ambient temps are 77-79 F ( side panel off) .","Cons:From what i have seen i will say that the rx 580 outperforms the 1060, but if you really want some of the features of geforce experience or your case doesn't fit a standard  sized card ( because all of the rx 580 on the market now are about 9 inches or bigger) or you are a green team fan boy then go with the 1060.","Other Thoughts:If you buy a 3gb version than you cannot call it a true 1060, more like a 1055 ti. just buy the 6gb version instead of making your system ram do your gpus job. But consider the rx 580 even if you despise the people who make mini little silicon ovens over at amd."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2017-06-30,Pros:- strong enough to handle most anything I throw at it.- video memory to spare.- despite being a single fan it runs fairly cool. Only hits 55c running Forza Horizon 3.- insanely quiet.- lower power draw than my previous card.- small form factor.,Cons:- the steadily climbing price.- had to fiddle a little bit with bios settings to get it working properly with my motherboard. Enabling the PCI legacy mode did the trick.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Eh, it's OK",2017-06-28,"Pros:Pre overclocked is good, decent performance for such a stubby little card, cooler seems effective enough for me.","Cons:GeForce Experience is an awful disaster, for some reason cs go runs like horribly shutter sputter 15-25 fps.","Other Thoughts:I got it before the major price hike. Don't install GFE well you have to to get the free game but get rid out it after. Like I said cs go runs horribly but Just Cause 3 runs great so the card isn't defective it's something wrong with cs go. I have both the Rx 580 8GB and this GTX1060 6GB my old card was R9 280x 3GB, the 580/1060 really are the new mid level cards for 1080p.Temps and noise aren't too bad very cool ambient 66-68f  %100 load runs 65c fan %51, warm room 72f+ the card ramps up the fan to try and keep it no more than 70c so it gets a little loud but not as loud as an old single fan HD6870 I have.Over all it's an interesting little card, if you get it for a reasonable price it's fine and realize that a single fan card is a little louder than dual and triple fan cards it's just common sense."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-06-26,"Pros:- Very powerful for it's size.- Great quality, you can tell it's a great quality card just by it's weight.  It's pretty heavy for it's size.- Plays all my games on ultra setting in 1080p at >60FPS.","Cons:- People have complained about the noise of the fan, but I can't hear mine at all with it running at full load.  I think it's because I have great air flow in my case, so it doesn't get hot enough for the fan to ramp up.  So in other words, so con's for me.","Other Thoughts:I'll be honest, when I first saw this card, I immediately disregarded it because of it's size.  I wanted a full size SSC or a card with at least 2-fans.  But with the prices going up on the other cards right now, I had no choice but to purchase this card.  Well, I have no regrets what-so-ever.  This card runs cool, and performs absolutely amazing.  I love it, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a powerful graphics card at a good price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice card,2017-06-24,Pros:- small- 6-pin power connector- 50-100% better fps vs GTX 660 while also moving graphics from medium-high to ultra,"Cons:dvi -> display-port adapters don't work, if your running dual dvi use a dvi to hdmi adapter.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic. Runs cool and super stable.,2017-06-20,Pros:Great mid range card. Runs pretty much everything I throw at it at over 100 FPS on Ultra settings. Super easy install.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:If you want a card that will run everything on Ultra for the next 2 or 3 years you got your card right here.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-06-17,Pros:Very powerful for it's price,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card, especially for it's price to performance ratio."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Product! Love EVGA Products,2017-05-05,Pros:- Stays cool- easy install-comes with a nice program that keeps track of fan speed and heat ext...,Cons:-fan can be loud at times,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Awesome!,2017-05-05,"Pros:FPS on Overwatch with an I3 6100 on epic is 90-170! On Ghost Recon Wildlands and on pretty high settings, it's like 55-100 ish. Upgraded from a 750TI which would run 60-80 FPS on Ultra settings in Overwatch. Ghost Recon is a really pretty game!","Cons:The fan can be a little loud at times on Ghost recon, but it could be because of the lack of air flow in my case. It's pretty big for a smaller card, but it fit in my case so no worries.",Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend if your looking for a smaller card that will run pretty much all the games you play.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Good but not great,2017-05-05,Pros:- Compact form factor- Good price point for level of performance,"Cons:- Not terribly loud, but certainly louder than my GTX 460 Cyclone 1GD5/OC from MSI which was whisper quite because it didn't use these stupid air duct designs and instead relied on a large fan with heat pipes from the chipset.  That MSI Cyclone was rock solid and I would buy it again in a heartbeat if they refreshed its design for the GTX 1060.- I really don't like the air duct cooling  arrangement for graphics cards, but I have no other choice because I don't see anything like my old card on the market any more and I do not want to deal with the upkeep of a liquid cooled design.","Other Thoughts:- I bought this card once as an upgrade from a GTX 460 and it worked for a few evenings of gaming before dying and (it would appear) taking the motherboard down with it (I tried both the old card and the onboard video, but could no longer get a signal on my monitor).  I am confident that it was compatible with my system and well within the capabilities of my power supply, so it was very likely a faulty card.  The replacement card I received has so far been working fine so hopefully it was a fluke.  Though I much would have preferred not having to replace my entire machine in the process."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge upgrade from a GTX 760 at a ridiculously low price!,2017-04-23,Pros:Fits easily in mid sized case. Running new games on ultra quite easily. The single fan keeps temps well in cool range on heavy loads (Witcher 3 maxed including Hairworks) and is very quiet. A no brainer upgrade on a budget.,"Cons:Just wish this had LEDs, but that is just flavor :)",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wonderful little beast!,2017-04-22,"Pros:- Very powerful little thing- Small form factor is a HUGE plus for future builds- Only 150W TDP / PCIe Power cable!- Installation was a breeze. It worked flawlessly plug and play on my old S5520SC Mobo- Drivers were easy to install and worked out of the box (make sure to download from nVidia site instead of the provided drivers, and to use DDU tool to remove your old drivers completely before that. You can search google for DDU, it's easy).- Runs anything very smoothly on 1080P and Ultra settings.- Looks really ""sexy""!- EVGA support and community (a real plus)- EVGA software easily adjusts the fan curve or over/under clocks the card","Cons:Can't think of any, but if only it had a backplate that would be nice. This would prevent dust from accumulating on it, but that's barely an issue.","Other Thoughts:Coming from an old ATI Radeon HD 5770 this is a huge boost for my rig.I'm really happy I bought this, especially the 6GB version. This card is a huge bang for buck! I find it way worthy that the larger and more expensive cards from its tier.I can't imagine a better choice for 1080P gaming given the size and price. Just bear in mind that it's not designed for extreme 4K performance so don't judge it for that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic product,2017-04-21,Pros:Easy installExcellent performanceReasonably priced,Cons:I have no criticisms,Other Thoughts:I would absolutely recommend this product.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Finally Got a good Card!,2017-04-20,"Pros:-Pretty good price to performance, i haven't found a game that this cant run well",Cons:-The heat can get a little out of control sometimes,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Amazing GPU, for the price!",2017-04-19,Pros:- The GPU is very affordable- The Base clock speeds are very high- For a single fan GPU over clocks well- Stays cool even under high loads- Easily the best GPU that you can get for the $250 price range,Cons:- NONE!,"Other Thoughts:- Been running the card in 2560 x 1440 and have had no issues with games, playing most in high settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great little card at a slightly awkward price point,2017-04-19,"Pros:As a higher-end budget card, there's not a lot more you could ask for: performance reportedly approaching a GTX 980 for less than $250, plus a small form factor for convenient installation and a solid factory overclock. I put it inside a mini-ITX build to replace a dying 2GB 960, and now it plays Dark Souls 3 on ultra at a rock-solid 1080/60fps without even approaching max usage. With a custom, more aggressive fan curve, doesn't get over 70 degrees Celsius on the Heaven benchmark.EVGA delivers its usual no-nonsense aesthetics and good build quality (they even included a case badge!), and the smaller card fits in my Fractal Design Core 500 with plenty of room to spare (especially compared to the monstrously gigantic MSI card it replaced). The Precision XOC utility is handy too.","Cons:Gets very loud with fan speed over about 50%. I recommend headphones to drown out its tortured screaming.No LEDs, if that's your thing.As other reviewers have said, where this card lies in terms of performance is a little odd: maybe a bit more than what you need for 1080p, maybe a little less than what you need for 1440p. It's definitely not bad at either, but the RX 480/580 and the 3GB 1060 are only a little bit worse at 1080p for significantly less money. I probably wouldn't have replaced even my 960 if it wasn't for the thought of going through a month-long RMA process with MSI all for the sake of a card I'd probably replace in a year or two anyway.That said, if you need 1080p/60fps performance at max settings AND a small form factor, then this card is probably one of your very few choices, and likely the best -- so go ahead and grab it!",Other Thoughts:I'd probably pick this over ZOTAC's mini 1060s just on the basis of clock speeds.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Review for: 1060 SC Gaming ACX 2.0 Single Fan 6GB,2017-04-18,"Pros:Pros:Runs cool -- 28C-32C idle, 60~C while in gameQuiet fan (Unless you are running at 80%+ fan speed, and if you do - reconsider your life)Powerful card (I've yet to experience less than 60 FPS)Good price",Cons:No SLI,"Other Thoughts:Excellent videocard. Small, efficient and mostly quiet. Great video card for gaming at 1080p."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great mid range graphics card!,2017-04-18,Pros:- EVGA warranty- Runs cool- Perfect 1080p gaming card- So far no issues after 6+ months,Cons:- Price to performance isn't the best- None,Other Thoughts:This is a great little 1060 and won't let you down!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice and compact,2017-04-18,"Pros:This card uses lot less wattage for the power it puts out, easy keeps me above 60 fps in all my games",Cons:haven't found any cons yet,Other Thoughts:I would gladly recommend this graphics card
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Significantly better than my 960 SSC!,2017-04-18,"Pros:-Games look and run so much better than on my old 960 SSC.-Quieter than my old 960.-Smaller, lighter, and no sag at all.","Cons:-An SLI slot would be nice, but that doesn't affect me.","Other Thoughts:-It would be nice to be able to have the fan run without having to use PrecisionX. What I mean is that the fan does run, but only when it gets super hot, which I can't imagine being good for the life of the card. I could be wrong, of course. I'd like to not have to run PrecisionX just to keep the card at a temperature I feel is safe. Again, I could be completely wrong about what's good for the card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Outstanding Card,2017-04-18,Pros:Smaller sizeIncredible PerformanceLow Power ConsumptionRuns Quietly,Cons:Not worth mentioning.,"Other Thoughts:Bought to replace my 770 FTW (EVGA).  I needed a smaller card with a better power usage rating.  What I got was a card that met those requirements and doubled the performance of my 770 FTW.  According to the Heaven Benchmark Utility, the 1060 out performed my 770 by double.  I strongly recommend this card.  It has not had any issue running any games thus far. From Minecraft through DOOM it has done a very nice job."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card since the GTX 460,2017-04-18,"Pros:Price to performance reminds me of the GTX 460 days.  No issues at all in almost a year of ownership.  Runs cool, whisper quiet.  Perfect solution for 1080p setup for gaming amd graphic arts.  Single fan and short card made for a perfect micro atx solution.  No coil whine, folds like a champ.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Bought at launch amd has been in use round the clock since.  Looks dinky now that it has been moved to a full ATX case setup.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card - Fast and Quiet,2017-04-18,Pros:-Great price/performance point-Single-fan version runs quiet and cool.-Small card was nice and easy to install,Cons:-wasn't free,"Other Thoughts:-I was skeptical that I needed 6GB of VRAM, but was surprised how many games use more than 4. Glad I didn't cheap out and get the 3GB version (which is also clocked slower).-Not sure why anyone would need a 2-fan version."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product!,2017-04-18,Pros:- Small model with low power usage- Runs most of the games I play extremely well,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:If you're looking to run the hardcore games on max settings, this probably won't be enough. But for mid/high settings this is a great card for the price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,a tiny cannon,2017-04-18,Pros:small but strong,Cons:none till now,"Other Thoughts:Though I put it in a mid-tower case, it is definitely suitable for smaller case as the temperature is always low. Userbenchmark.com showed my  graphic card is beyond the average of 1060s before the 3gb version was released."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card. Great Value,2017-04-18,Pros:Performs as expected.Price is terrific.Size is convenient for small builds.,Cons:None other than high temps but thats fine in a single fan gpu.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2017-04-18,"Pros:It's a nice, compact card at a great price that made building a HTPC very reasonable. It's also going to be used for a VR headset in the near future.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product by EVGA,2017-04-15,"Pros:Powerful, small and compact.  Does a great job in my HTPC.  I have purchased 10s of dozens of EVGA products, I have had one fail (x79 mobo with faulty USB).  Wonderful product.  Exactly what I needed in my HTPC.","Cons:Due to my use of it in an HTPC, if the body was the same size and on the same plane as the back mount,that could be an improvement.  It is a tight fit in an HTPC case with the power cables coming from the top, or you could place the power cables coming from the back and heck, you got another 1/4"" height wise to play with.","Other Thoughts:Yes.  Whether it is for a budget gaming system, if you want to run VR, or if you use it like me for 4k streaming, well worth it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Wowzers!,2017-04-11,"Pros:I previously ordered the 06G-P4-6267-KR but due to poor placement of my SATA ports it just wouldn't fit! Just too BIG, so I got this card instead, and it is 6.8 Inches of PURE PLEASURE!I've got the performance of the larger card, but in a smaller package.",Cons:Heat dissipation is mediocre.,Other Thoughts:It's a great step up from the onboard GPU.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,exceded my expectations,2017-04-03,"Pros:This exceeded my expections . I was expecting a small cheeply made card , what I got was a well made , heavy card .  The heatsink on this looks like coper heatpipes and runs very cool at idle , in fact the fan is off at idle ! (cool ) I was suprised at the weight of the card this size . I bought this to run mass effect andromada and that is does , wow the eye candy is breathtakingI highly recomend this card the bang for the buck , build quality , and proformance are outstanding !!!","Cons:only one small con , the fan can get a little loud under load but is does the job very well if dead silent is what your after then this card is not for you","Other Thoughts:coming from a asus 950 to this wow ! I get even get better 2d quality , images look lke you could peel them off the screed"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Works Beautifully,2017-03-14,Pros:Built my computer about two weeks ago. I haven't had any issues with benchmarks yet. This is my first time building a computer and I'm not disappointed with the speed and quality this GPU puts out.,Cons:None as of yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Price to Performance,2017-03-10,Pros:Insanely fast for the price. Extremely compact for it's performance. Fit well into my case.,"Cons:Like others have mentioned, it can be extremely loud under load. My fan speeds were usually between 60% and 100% while running graphically extensive applications. This may have been due to case airflow limitations though.",Other Thoughts:Computer running this GPU:- i3 7100- Corsair 8GB DDR4 2400- EVGA 1060 SC 6GB [single fan]- EVGA 500W PSU- Silverstone SG13BDidn't dock an egg for audibility. Other [video] reviews mention it stays pretty quiet in cases with great airflow.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-02-19,Pros:I have a mini ITX motherboard and small form-factor case so the Heat output was a big issue for me. this card runs cooler then my old EVGA GTX 760 SC well on me to run Max settings I'm almost all games. can't recommend this card enough you won't be disappointed if your coming from an older card like I was.,Cons:the fan is loud if you run it up to the 4000 RPM Redline. that being said mine never goes above 50%,Other Thoughts:have the card for two weeks really happy with it
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Better Than I Expected,2017-02-19,"Pros:This card really is the king of 1080p gaming. Elite: Dangerous had been ranging between 24-60 fps with my old GTX 660 ti card and now runs a smooth 57-61 fps with the 1060 with most settings at Ultra and a few at High (VSync on). Card runs cool. The fan doesn't even activate until after about a half hour of playing Elite and then just barely. Haven't seen the temps go above 55 C under stock fan settings. Plays Elite, Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas effortlessly at max or near max settings at 60 fps.*UPDATE 2/19/17* Tried it with The Witcher 3 and that makes it run hotter, around 70-75 C with the fan going over 60%.","Cons:The only problem I had was that one of the two back panel screw holes didn't quite line up with the one in my case, but the other one did, so the card is locked down well enough. Just a minor irritation and could be my case's fault.","Other Thoughts:Smooth 1080p gaming, runs cool and quiet, what's not to love? If, like me, you were wondering if it was really worth it to upgrade from a 660 ti, go for it! It really does make a difference."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Card,2017-02-03,Pros:Great 1080p gaming,Cons:Does not turn on randomly after going into sleep mode while pressing key board or mouse; so have to hard turn off computer,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Yes, has no problem with 4k monitor.",2017-02-02,Pros:- It is really quiet...  almost as quiet as the fanless Nvidia 650 I had before I bought this.- Had 0 issues while installing the card.  Works perfectly after 5 days of use.,"Cons:- Performance improvement on games, over my old 650 card, is not noticeable except for ability run higher resolutions.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid upgrade,2017-01-30,"Pros:Best card I could fit in my stock HPHigh fps on multiple games, limited only by my monitorGreat value",Cons:If only a dual fan could be a little smaller,"Other Thoughts:Coming from a 750ti, this card is epic! Witcher 3 is very lush at 60 fps and doesn't drop below 50 fps on Ultra with mostly max settings in a fight."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Small But mighty.,2017-01-24,Pros:Normal EVGA quality without the stupid MLG/ROG/420 no-scope aesthetic. (if you know what I mean)Small- fits in almost all cases.Powerful- runs all modern titles at mostly high to ultra settings assuming 1080P resolution.Nvidia stability- never have driver issues on the green team.,Cons:Runs hot.Runs loud.,Other Thoughts:If space is not a problem then go with a full size card you will thank me.If you must go with a small card then you might want to under-clock this little guy for normal daily use as I find that it stayed hot even when under very little load.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good Product!,2017-01-23,"Pros:-Easy to install, as would be expected.-Arrived quick and in a sturdy box, so it wasn't damaged at all.-Software was easy to install as well.-Runs most sorts of games buttery smooth, at least for me!-Easy fit for small towers.","Cons:-Not actually the card's fault, but EVGA's Precision tuner absolutely kills performance on really nonintensive products. Paint.NET refused to respond, but this was easily rectified by just shutting off the EVGA program.-My box did not come with instructions on install, which is fine if you've seen other people do this sort of thing, but could really turn off a newbie who honestly wants to get into this without fear of damaging these 200+ dollar components. I took an egg off just for this.","Other Thoughts:I recommend this product to people who have the money to get the 6GB model. The extra 50 bucks can be a bit of a pain, but the extra 3GB of VRAM certainly will help the card survive a lot longer with other models coming out.I would have really liked to know a good estimate for power supply usage as a whole, not just recommended for this card; Thankfully I already had one strong enough to pull the card's weight.All in all, I will most certainly be purchasing from EVGA again in the future."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,The best video card to get without spending a ton,2017-01-20,"Pros:Battlefield 1 - Ultra detail with max 1920x1080 resolution on ASUS 24"" 144hz monitor.  Runs like absolute butter with zero lag or drop in framesCan't believe the size of the card and the power it hasMuch less fan noise then my old dual fan cards",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:For the size, price, and performance you can't beat it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 6GB,2017-01-10,Pros:-Small for small towers-The better 1060 (This)-Doesn't get crazy hot.,Cons:-Not flashy,Other Thoughts:-Only get a 6gb 1060 model. It is way better
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 SC 6GB,2017-01-09,"Pros:Wonderful product with compact design, amazing if there's little room to work with in the case and still gives amazing near perfect performance at 1080p res.",Cons:None that I have.,"Other Thoughts:Amazing buy for 1080p gaming users, 4k users, its good, but maybe something else is better."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good option for a budget 1440p experience.,2017-01-09,Pros:- EVGA quality.- Small size makes makes this an ideal upgrade for micro ATX builds and for cases with limited space.- Desirable frame rates and detail settings are achievable for 1440p gaming.- Relatively low power consumption.,Cons:- SLI is not an option.- DVI screws always come off when I unhook my monitor.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent Product,2017-01-01,Pros:-Excellent cooling capability-High factory overclock speed-Compact design,Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:-Comes with a nice factory overclock, so not a lot of manual overclocking here; locked voltage."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,1st gpu and very satisfied,2016-12-27,"Pros:This is the first gpu I've ever purchased that went in the first gaming level PC I've ever owned. I say this because I don't have anything to really compare it to.I can say that this card was the perfect choice for me. I needed a shorter card, and this one has the absolute best power to size ratio on the market right now.So far it runs ice cold and silent running 1080p max settings at least 60fps on GTA 5, Skyrim, ds3, steep, etc. 250+ on cs:go. I say at least 60fps because my monitor is an LG IPS 75hz, I just keep it in 60 with vsync on, because that alone is a monumental step up from even my ps4 pro. with vsync off, I get ~100+ fps on GTA 5 max settings 1080p.Did I mention silent and ice cold? truly",Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:I think it's too bad they didn't leave an option for SLI with the 1060 and down, but 1 is all I need anyway"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Small, Power Efficient, and Powerful!",2016-12-13,"Pros:• Packs a huge performance punch in a much smaller size than other GTX 1060's.• Even though it has a smaller heatsink and only a single fan, it still cools almost as well as other GTX 1060's.","Cons:Originally the card shipped with the 0 dB BIOS, which did not have that aggressive of a fan curve and made the card hot on idle and regularly reach 80°C under load. For some reason this BIOS is also incompatible with nouveau, and it was not possible to boot into Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10 without using my integrated graphics to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. EVGA a few months later then rolled out BIOS version 86.06.27.01.60, which solved all of these issues. The fan idles at around 20% speed now, but is not audible at all.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Simply great.,2016-12-06,"Pros:This is my first computer build, and I am so lucky to have built a computer in this time in technology. I have never tried any other graphics cards, so I can't necessarily compare with anything. All I can say is it's power is matching with the previous generations top dogs for $200 less. If you're coming from a 960 or a 970, you might be surprised with the difference (970 not so much, but you have the extra 2.5GB of VRAM to work with, so I'm not sure).",Cons:None thus far.,"Other Thoughts:It does tend to run hot while gaming without your own fan curve, but I would assume that most do. MSI Afterburner solved that problem, not to mention that I get to view all of my systems temperatures and usages alongside keeping my GPU cool. EVGA Precision XOC can also solve this problem, but you can't view all of your systems temperatures and usages with it, only your GPUs."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performance and a great upgrade in my case.,2016-11-28,"Pros:- Compact design ensures compatibility with most if not all form factor cases. (Used mine in Corsair 230t)- Low Fan Noise- Great Upgrade from a GTX 960, if you have a 960 or below (950, 760 ect) there is a great performance leap that is worth the upgrade.-Sits comfortably between a 970 and 980 in terms of performance",Cons:- None so far,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,A dreamboat!,2016-11-25,"Pros:Fast, quiet, compact!  It makes my system run a lot quieter and also runs noticeably cooler.  Handles all my gaming very smoothly.  I upgraded from an old GTX 480.  Very glad I did, while my old card served me well, this was a great replacement for it.",Cons:I don't get to use it more than I do now!,"Other Thoughts:(nothing to do with the card) I to flash my MB and update it and tinker with it quite a bit to get it to recognize the card.  Once I did, it was smooth sailing for a couple of months now."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING,2016-11-19,Pros:-More impressive performance leap from the 960 to 1060 than the 760 to 960 was.-Small size-Decent cooler/pipe array and  fan setup.,"Cons:-Fluctuating prices and availability.-Questionable Nvidia driver quality.-For a 1080p card, it's a little overkill. For 1440p, it's average.-No back plate.-","Other Thoughts:Great card. But for 1080p, you can go cheaper."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic Graphics Card for the Price,2016-11-14,"Pros:I bought this card before the holiday price spike (around $250). It runs fantastic, I've run Fallout 4/Skyrim Remastered/Payday 2/EU 4/CSGO all on max settings and this card doesn't break a sweat. FPS stays above 60fps, usually much higher since I only use 1080p (normal is around 90-100), and I haven't seen it rise above 60 degrees Celsius even under full load for several hours. It is also very quiet, I never hear the fan. The configuration software provided by EVGA allows me to overclock and set gpu AI no problem.",Cons:None really.,"Other Thoughts:During the holidays the demand (and price) for this card increases exponentially, as one would expect. I would hold out until you find it offered online at a decent price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Very efficient, High value, Small form",2016-11-04,Pros:Runs very quietRarely hear it at allLow power consumptionRuns stable at hotter temps,"Cons:Not as powerful as it's 1070 sister. (of course, not as expensive either)","Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card to people who are upgrading stock cases. It will fit in just about any mid tower I have seen. The thing is tiny in comparison to many other cards I have had. I have seen some people worrying about it's high operating temp, but honestly I think that is just its stable temp range. 5 eggs. Lots of goodies in the box as well."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good card,2016-11-04,Pros:Max out 1080P gaming great card,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:6.8 inches, that's what she said."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,More than enough for me,2016-10-31,"Pros:Small form factor, a lot of power, its fan is off all the time unless I'm playing a very graphics intensive game, which I rarely do.",Cons:I don't play enough graphics intensive games to justify such a nice card!,"Other Thoughts:I put it in a Raijintek Metis case. Fits perfectly, although I did put a blow hole in the top to help deal with it running slightly hotter than I wanted. (High 70 C to low 80 C when playing No Man's Sky.)"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product. Works as advertise,2016-10-31,Pros:-Price-Performs extremely well-Ease to overclock-Perfect for 1080p gaming-Runs quiet  even under full load,Cons:-None so far and I  have been running for several hours everyday while gaming since I got it and no hiccups of any kind.,Other Thoughts:-Would recommend to anyone looking for a very good card at a even better price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing FPS,2016-10-29,Pros:Replaced a hd6950 with this thing in my lga775 maximus 2 formula and I'm now playing the newest games with maxed settings at 60+ fps.-small form factor-good value,Cons:none expected,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance for 1080p gaming,2016-10-28,"Pros:-Great value if you can find the card in stock at close to MSRP.-Performance is pretty much flawless at 1080p-Very power efficient, which is the main reason I chose this over the RX 480. My 400 W (high quality) power supply works fine with this card. The card only needs one 6-pin power connector.-The fan is quiet.-Idle power draw seems to be very low. I noticed that the fan doesn't even turn on at idle.",Cons:Frequently priced substantially above MSRP.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING,2016-10-23,"Pros:Small in Size only 1 6 pin needed, Runs Cool",Cons:Drivers from Nvidia are unstable after hours trying to figure out if it was my monitor or the video card and trying 2 other monitors and installing multiple drivers all attempts failed. I should have waited for at least 6 months or longer till Nvidia would get the drivers ironed out,None

Fry Cry 3 / 4, DOOM, etc.  Fallout 4 gets 60 FPS on ultra except for Diamond City.This thing does protein folding six times better than the old card (PPD now ~360,000):  Hits no higher than 74C folding and less than that while gaming.Boost clock goes up to 1960 MHz, but your results may vary.",Cons:Remember to take that stupid protective film off of the case.,Other Thoughts:Remember to a complete uninstall of your video drivers and install the latest driver from nvidia
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid.,2016-10-11,Pros:The best value GPU on the market (generally speaking).,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:I put this in a machine with a Skylake Pentium, and it can run World of Warcraft at maximum settings. So for about $300 you have yourself max WoW graphics."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Plug and play,2016-10-11,Pros:Purchased this for 1080p gaming and haven't been disappointed. Size of unit permits for unobstructed airflow within my Nano S case.  Using MSI Afterburner for tweaking GPU. Great experience. Idle @ 25c  Load @ 68c with aggressive setting.  EVGA BIOS upgrade available for semi-passive fan use.  No coil noise.,"Cons:Lack of SLI, LED or backplate.",Other Thoughts:Great bang for your buck.  Solid engineering and performance.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Value for the Price,2016-10-10,"Pros:- Awesome Value in this tiny card.  Mine came with the 0db fan bios, so was a simple driver download from the website, and i was up and running.   Plays all my games at 60fps, and they look amazing now!- Small size and only needs 1 6pin from the power supply has also cleaned up my case and increased air flow!- Stays cool using the default fan profile.  Have not felt the need to use a custom fan curve yet.",Cons:No Cons here.,Other Thoughts:Replaces a 4 year old HD7870 that decided to fail.  Could not be happier with this choice.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card for LAN Rigs/small form factor PC builds,2016-10-08,Pros:- Card size will fit in most small form factor cases that accept full size riser cards.- EVGA great grapic card company that has wonderful support.- GTX1060 benchmarks..go look them up! This card will be standard in all my friends low budget PC builds,Cons:- No SLI support :(- No shiny LED lights,"Other Thoughts:Hey....stop reading reviews...put this into your cart, head over to EVGA to look at benchmarks, put your wallet up to the screen, and give them your money! This card is amazing. I plan on recommending this card to anyone who has a small form factor PC build, travels to LANs, goes to QuakeCon, takes their shirt off while gaming, drinks too much Jack Daniels. Really. you need a new video card your Voodoo2 just isn't cutting it anymore. It's time to upgrade! DO IT! DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS!!!!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wow nice card,2016-10-07,"Pros:EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING, played all  online games  at max 1080p res with great fps.Small card fit perfect into my  small case.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very easy to install and a great upgrade to GTX 750 Ti,2016-10-07,Pros:The size of the card takes up very little space in my system case and the power requirements are well suited to both general and gaming requirements.,"Cons:None yet, but I'll keep looking.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to anyone who is considering the jump to the GeForce 10 series cards.  While it may not have all the specs that a seriously hardcore gamer wants, this card is very well suited to the other 95% of the gamers out there!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 SC Gaming (SF),2016-10-07,"Pros:- Runs very cool in a mini ITX case (even with just one fan)- Low noise.- More than enough horsepower for 1080 HD (really...1080 HD is hi def enough for most of us mortals)- Will run most any new title at max or near max settings. (leaps and bounds ahead of cards from a few years ago)- Only needs one six pin for power.- Quality as expected from EVGA!- No LED's or excess junk.- Optional software to control fans.- Can be overclocked further (but why bother?)- Affordable and includes a case badge, some stickers and poster.","Cons:- Really none as far as I can see, does what it says on the tin and then some.","Other Thoughts:Bought this to replace a 3 year old GTX 760, it was a great card...got the 1060 for about the same price and it's far better, should future proof my gaming for a few years. Of course I use a 1920x1080 LED HD monitor so it runs that smooth as butter if you are into 2k or more then you should probably move up to a 1070, but for 1080 HD this 1060 is the bomb.Be sure to get the SC Gaming model the cheaper version has a cheesy heatsink and the SC is already OC'd.Been playing Fallout 4 on Ultra with tons of texture mods and runs at 60 FPS with only a few drops in FPS when the action gets busy or there is a lot of foliage around, runs Elite Dangerous Horizons maxed out as well, also used on a few smaller indie games like Fishing Planet and I can't even tell it's running.All in all this card should serve most normal 1080 HD PC gamers very well and in the last 10 years I've had zero issues with any EVGA cards I've used...very high quality. When I upgrade again in a few years (or up to a 1070) I will choose EVGA and Newegg!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Doing something wrong?,2016-10-05,Pros:Overall I guess it was a good buy. easy to setup and is still fast however...,Cons:I can't seem to run GTA 5 in atleast High settings at 60fps. Other games like the Division and Battlefront work perfectly and smooth so maybe it's just GTA is poorly optimized. I would've expected the 1060 to be able to run gta in ultra but it doesn't that way which is why i'm also unsure of how other youtube videos playing gta 5 in ultra are able to run it consistently. I'm even using Precision XOC and that still isn't helping either.,Other Thoughts:I was originally using an r9 380 but there doesn't seem to be a huge difference between the two cards. how long until this card becomes obsolete?
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Best ""Sweet spot"" card I've ever seen. Best current 1060 to buy.",2016-09-30,"Pros:As the title says, this is the best ""sweet spot"" card I've seen. The previous generation card in the ""sweet spot"" was the GTX 970, which came in at $400 and was actually a pretty good deal. This however blows that deal out of the water. This kind of performance (any game on the planet at 1080p, ultra graphics, at a constant 60fps) is simply unbelievable to me at this price pint, which is currently $259.Add to that the size of this card, which is probably 2/3 to half the size of many current cards. I LOVE this. Makes it so easy to use in almost any build.QUIET! I can barely hear this thing running (probably due to the single fan) while playing games.In a nutshell, this is the best performing card per dollar on the market. And this particular one (EVGA 6gb) is the best value among them.",Cons:None. Works perfectly out of the box at low temps and with super quiet operation.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid Card,2016-09-26,"Pros:Small, powerful, affordable, runs cool, overclocks well, good value and highly rated. I would recommend this to anyone who games at 1080p.",Cons:I might have a problem with low minimum framerates when overclocking as I noticed a trend where the higher I overclocked the higher the average fps would go but the minimum fps would actually lower. Could be a problem for some people but yet to be a problem for me playing The Witcher 3.,Other Thoughts:Using EVGA Precision X OC I got an overclock of +150MHz on the GPU and +500MHz on the memory. My Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 score is 1845 with an average framerate of 73.3 and runs at 70 degrees C after 20 minutes in Furmark. I haven't ran it overnight yet so we'll see if the overclock can survive an 8hr stress test.EDIT: turns out +150MHz is a little too much for The Witcher 3 to run stably but +90 works well.. At max settings with Hairworks I average in the low 50 fps with dips down to 40 at times but definitely still playable and enjoyable visually. Also using Precision X OC I had to increase the voltage bar on the left to 50% just fyi.One thing that bugged me was my custom Fan map didn't apply properly in Precision X OC so I had to run it in Aggressive mode instead. Not a huge deal and could just be me but it was something.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful.,2016-09-15,"Pros:I think I heard the card laugh, when I requested Skyrim maxed out.  It offered it up in 2K.  GTA V is maxed out at 1080p.  There may be frame rate dips, but I didn't notice.  I haven't officially measured anything.  I haven't overclocked or utilized the boost feature.  The card is a beast!",Cons:None.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Eveything is perfect except......,2016-09-13,Pros:-Small form factor for the same specs as a double fan graphics card.-easy to setup-Benchmark and stress test are incredible-Really great product overall,Cons:-Normally a graphics card will come with an adapter for the DVI and VGA. This card only come with the power adapter (For old power supply). So be aware !,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,No Man’s Sky? No Problems!,2016-09-13,Pros:-Price to Performance Ratio-Small Form Factor,Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from an EVGA GTX 970 SSC ACX 2.0. Although the 970 is more than capable of running most games (GTA5, Skyrim, ARMA 3, etc) at high settings with 40 to +60fps (1080p), I had to give in to the hype of the 1060. At the price point Newegg was offering the card, I had to get one for myself.After receiving the card, I installed it along with the 1060's driver and 10 series specific EVGA Precision OC software. I also installed the 0db Fan Stop BIOS (the factory BIOS will have the fan running at 45%, minimum). I ran it at factory clock on Unigine Extreme settings (3 times) and got an average score of 2133.In my ITX case (specs below), I was getting temps up to 82C on the card, max, on each of the run, with the base curve. After fiddling with a custom curve, I was able to have the fan operate at a tolerable noise level and keeping the temperature at under 75C.Gaming-wise, the temps run slightly lower than the benchmarking temps, between 60-70C, depending on the instance in the game. I can run GTA5 maxed out @ +60fps. On No Man's Sky, with this card an my other specs, I get +60fps on the highest settings at 1080p, at all instances with no crashes (as reported by many people). Every now and then I'd get a few dips in fps but it most likely the game and not the GPU. This card is No Man's Sky friendly!If you're looking to upgrade and on a tight budget, don't settle for anything in the 900 series. This card cost less and performs just as well as the highest 900 series. I highly recommend this card!Specs:Case: Thermaltake Core V1CPU: i5 6600KMobo: GIGABYTE GA-H170N-WIFIRAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 8GB (4Gx2)OS: Windows 10GPU: EVGA 1060 SC ACX 2.0 Single FanPSU: CX750MCPU Cooler: LEPA AquaChanger 120"

That is more my problem than the card I guess.","Other Thoughts:I went from a Radeon 5670 (it died) to this and WOW talk about night and day.  With the 5670 the best I could do was Medium graphics settings.  Now with the 1060 I am running max settings on the games I play (iRacing and ETS2).  If you can't afford or don't want to spend $200-$400 more (like me) on a 1070 or 1080,  this is a great card for the money!CPU-FX-4300 OC'd @4.1 GHzCPU cooler- Corsair H70MB- ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0RAM- Corsair Vengeance 8GB DDR3 1866PSU- 550 Watt"

But 1 seems to do the job okLack of SLI in the 1060,"Other Thoughts:I run the Witcher 3 and some other AAA titles with max detail at 1080p with this card at a very good frame rate.Nice upgrade for me coming from an EVGA GTX 670card runs at 35c puttering around in windows, and 65c while gaming with the fan at 70%"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Easy overclocking, works great",2016-09-07,Pros:Easy install in my Phanteks p400 case and MSI z-170 pro motherboard.  Overclocking software is as easy or in depth as you want (I'm brand new to PC gaming). Was able to get great performance on Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (1440p 60fps after overclocking with very high settings).,Cons:None so far,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Love the card!,2016-09-07,"Pros:This was a major upgrade from my old 750 card. All games are running smoothly (FHD). With the new firmware the card is silent when non intensive GPU work is done. I have a small case, but the temperature of the card never exceeded 78 C. The fan was not too noisy either.",Cons:Nothing really.,"Other Thoughts:Great card, small, quiet. I like the fact that there are no LEDs on it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2016-09-07,Pros:Wanted to upgrade my 660 Ti and this was in about the same price range as the 660 Ti was when I got it.  Love the performance and the size is a nice plus.  Painless upgrade.,Cons:No real complaints.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great performance card at a good price, runs cool and quiet",2016-09-07,"Pros:-Great performance - I've been playing BF1 beta, Crysis, etc at 1080p with Ultra-high/maxed out settings with vertical sync on, and it keeps framerates at a consistent 60 fps with little to no fps drop.-Small form factor allows it to fit in smaller cases.-Cool and quiet (maxes out at 70'C during gaming, and the fan turns off during idle with the new EVGA bios)-Cheaper compared to other OCed GTX1060s (MSRP at $260)-Factory overclocked out of the box",Cons:-No backplate (it'd be nicer looking since others in this price range have backplates)-No SLi (none of the 1060s have this ability),Other Thoughts:Great product at a great price
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best Bang For The Buck Hands Down,2016-09-07,"Pros:Size, Size, Size, did I say size? This little GTX1060sc is exceptional for the size, totally outscores my GTX970 in every benchmark I put it through. It's an EVGA... Who else could pull this off? dollar for dollar the best graphics card for the money there is. If you can get your hands on this I definitely would recommend you stop looking and buy this one.","Cons:I can't find one, when you do let me know.","Other Thoughts:Totally Recommend, Yes I would buy it again and yes I would recommend it to a friend."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card for the money period!,2016-09-07,"Pros:Clearly if you are looking at this card, or in fact reading anyones reviews, you already know this card is awesome and its what you are looking for. I could say allot about this but the most important thing I can say is, First thing, Price$$$. This is the absolute best price for such a budget card that owns! I came from a very good running eVGA 760 SS and this card completely smooths everything I play. DOOM 2016, Both Metro games and several others.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card for the money,2016-09-07,Pros:-This card is less expensive than almost every 1060 but performs just as well if not better-Runs cool-Lower power usage-Zero Fanspeed mode-Quiet-Only $10 more than nonSC version (better heatsink)-Max out any game at 1080p-Good warranty,Cons:Need to get a 1070 to max out some titles at 1440p,Other Thoughts:I believe this is the best 1060 value you can get and most certainly the best card for around $250
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,BEST GPU for 1080p 144hz gaming,2016-09-05,"Pros:-35C idle temperature (I have 6 fans in my case: 2 front, 2 top, 2 back)-45C load temperature (pretty good)-I get 130fps in GTA 5 on maxed out settings (85 fps if I put distance to max in advance settings)-I get 95+fps in Battlefield 1 Beta on ultra settings-Affordable card, I bought it for $256.78 (including tax)",Cons:-None at the moment (I have been using this card for more than a month now),"Other Thoughts:This is better than the GTX 1070 because if you look at benchmarks, the 1070 will have around 20fps more than the 1060. $200 more for 20fps more is not worth it in my opinion. Stick with this card to save money and have good results."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice,2016-09-05,"Pros:Everything I need for gaming @ 1080, mighty quiet unless pushed to the limit, small form-factor, sips power like a lady, looks mighty good in a small case build.","Cons:Sad that it cannot be SLI`ed, but oh well.","Other Thoughts:If I could justify the price of a 1070 for the amount of gaming I do, or the resolution I use (1080) then I would have bought one. But for me this works just fine, out benchmarks the 970, and should be all I need for a while. The 6 GB RAM is excellent as well, and should serve me for a long time.For anyone doing an mATX/miniITX build that wants the most performance in the smallest size, you do not need to look any further. The only way to beat this is by water cooling a higher priced card, so if you are debating the cost or size just stop now and hit the Ad to Cart button. Unless you are waiting for it to be back in stock, then keep waiting, it`s worth every penny."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,2.0GHz Right Out of the Box! And for only $260! WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!?!,2016-09-02,Pros:- This card went right to 1960MHz when I got it up and running and peaked under load (naturally) at 2000MHz- Full load I can barely hear the fan over the case fans that I have- At Full load it usually is about 60-65 C (I have never seen this card achieve a temp over 65 C. EVER!),"Cons:Not really cons, but:- No backplate (Would be cool, but unnecessary due to the small size)- No LEDs (Again, totally unnecessary. But a light up EVGA logo like the 1070's would be pretty sweet)","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card. I can play all games maxed out at 60+ fps (Except for the cpu intensive ones due to a cpu bottleneck). Unless you want to try to OC this to its absolute max, your temps should stay below 70 C (even under load). Due to my cpu bottleneck, I have not had the opportunity to give this card a run for the money, but all things considered, BEST VALUE CARD!!! (Purchased it when it was $260) First time buying EVGA and I think I might stick with them from now on! Great product quality and a 3 year warranty."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great CUDA card for Premiere Pro,2016-09-01,Pros:Wonderful GPU acceleration for Adobe Premiere Pro video editing.  Great Bang-For=Buck performance and easy Memory Overclocking,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:So satisfied I just bought a second one   In testing with Premiere Pro BenchMark it is just as fast as my GTX 780Ti for GPU acceleration.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Excellent card, small and keeps cool.",2016-08-29,Pros:-Runs cool-Somewhat quiet at high RPM's-Good overclocking-Small,"Cons:LED's would've been cool, I'm not an LED everything kind of person, but a glow would've been neat.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Performs without issue.,2016-08-22,"Pros:Easy installation, smaller physical size, single quiet fan even under load.  The GTX 1060 performs very well for its price.","Cons:None.  6GB RAM is overkill for 1080p/1200p resolution but I'll probably get a 2560x1080 monitor soon and it will help with that, I suppose.","Other Thoughts:One of the other reviews for this product complains of high temperatures due to it having only one fan.  That has not been my experience.  This GPU plays DOOM at 1920x1200 resolution on Ultra at > 60fps without issue.  After an hour of game play, the card remains quiet with a temperature of  40C over ambient.  In my 22C/72F office, that's 62C/144F.  Those temperatures are well within tolerable limits."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,"Excellent performance, but why are my temperatures so high at full load?",2016-08-22,"Pros:Great graphics and framerate, yatta yatta... you've heard it all before -- it's as good as everyone has suggested. I upgraded from a GTX 760 and this is certainly a satisfactory upgrade. I played Dragon Age 3 for the first time comfortably with everything ULTRA /w fade-touched textures and 2x MSAA WITH VSync and things went great at a stable 50-60FPS. Dips down to the mid-40's with really intense scenes but extremely rare. I was very satisfied with the performance. Anyone who's played DA3 knows the environments are MASSIVE so to see it breeze through such scenes was exciting.","Cons:However...The single-fan design didn't seem to do as much for temps as others claimed it did. I'm not sure if it's a quality control issue like some have suggested, or that this is actually normal and some of these buyers were testing in arctic environments, but when at full load on Dragon Age 3, I was getting upwards of 87 Celsius, sometimes hitting 89 C after just a couple minutes. Bear in mind this was with a MAXIMUM efficiency airflow setup in a NZXT S340 case.Strangely, there were no adverse graphical effects, which leaves me no doubt that the card can handle the temperatures, but I simply didn't feel comfortable gaming for hours with it.  The temperatures scared me, so I turned VSync on for the framerate limit, which again, stays roughly around 60FPS. That way the GPU rarely goes to 100% utilization and temps stay around 60-70 C which is still a bit high, but not as insane as what I was witnessing before I did this. I also removed the front panel of the S340 so the fans could deal with the heat better as I could literally feel the OUTSIDE of my case become hot at those temperatures, which is kinda nuts.I absolutely did not feel comfortable leaving it at full load at those temperatures for hours.**COOLING CONFIG**NZXT S340 CASE:- 2x Corsair AF140's PULLING air at the FRONT- 1x Corsair SP140 PUSHING air out at the TOP- 1x Corsair AF120 PUSHING air out at the BACKAMBIENT AIR: ~80 F (Summer in NYC)OTHER POTENTIALLY RELEVANT FACTORS: Asus 970 Aura Motherboard, AMD FX8350, Super neat cable management and dust-free and impediment-free airflow (wish I could provide pictures -- grr Newegg).---NOTE: My CPU temperatures with this fan setup have been FANTASTIC, yet somehow this GPU's temps are reaching nearly 90C at full load... HOW??","Other Thoughts:If I could do it again, I probably would have spent a little extra money on a card with better fan/heatsink design. I might actually return this if I can manage to grab the Zotac design at a decent price. I had to remove the front panel on my case to deal with all the additional heat...ugly.I dunno, maybe I got a dud, I don't want to bag on EVGA, but it's my first time going with them (always been a fan of Gigabyte and Windforce) and I'm a little disappointed. I suppose it's not all bad considering it's not actually negatively affecting anything graphically as of yet, but these temps can't be safe."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,The best deal Nvidia has offered all year,2016-08-19,"Pros:- Amazing refresh rates- Excellent price point (paid $260)- This card should fit most PC cases (excluding micro cases)- Super easy to install with PCI-e power cable included- Huge improvement over my 970Ti- Super quite fan, even in an aluminum case",Cons:-Does not support SLI but comes with instructions on how to install up to 4 in SLI mode.   Cruel...very cruel.Does not include any drivers for offline installation.  Even though they would be out of date basic drivers should be included since Nvidia driver pack is currently over 450mb download.  For offline users or worse (DSL users) this is a non-starter.,Other Thoughts:Since I was upgrading from an Nvidia 960Ti card I simply updated the drivers and then shutdown and did a card swap.  Super easy.  Within 15 minutes I easily doubled my FPS.If you are a gamer looking to upgrade this card is worth serious consideration.  If you are running your PC on your large LED screen at 1080p like me then the 1070 and 1080 models are overkill.I'm so impressed with this card I am already shopping for a new gaming laptop with the integrated 1060 chip.This is my third EVGA made card.  All cards have been excellent.  Overclocking tools and monitoring software is first rate.  Manufacturing build quality is excellent.  Even under heavy load never had a heat spike.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Perfect for my needs,2016-08-18,Pros:- Fast- Great value- Zero RPM fan mode,Cons:- Need to download BIOS update,"Other Thoughts:I'm a teacher, and I installed this in my older Dell Optiplex 790 minitower in my classroom. The motherboard only supplies 35W through the PCI Express slot so I was worried that even with an upgraded power supply it would not work. I replaced the stock power supply with an EVGA 600 B1 to provide the needed 6-pin power connector for the card. Once installed, it started right up without any problems.I downloaded the new Zero RPM BIOS and now the card is silent when running less stressful tasks. Even when I start Garry's Mod, Minecraft, or Autodesk Inventor the card is never loud. I'm very happy to give new life to my older computer."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, quiet, easy setup",2016-08-16,"Pros:Runs Doom and Dying Light on maximum setting at 1080p with no issues.  I've seen it run as hot as 70C, but it's never loud.Ppl complain about no backplates on certain models like this one.  Graphics card looks don't matter much to me, but for what it's worth, It's the nicest looking card I've ever owned.The 9cm fan is a larger/quieter than the 8cm fans on my old card.",Cons:One fan instead of two may impede OC.  I haven't bothered overclocking this yet because there would be no noticeable performance change.,"Other Thoughts:I would have been happy with a 4GB RX 480 at $200, but I found this in stock first.  It is a little bit better product than an RX 480 4GB and 8GB and it's a little more expensive.  If you're thinking of spending around $250, I'd recommend this over the RX 480."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2016-08-16,"Pros:- It's small, gives more airflow in my mid tower.- It boosted to 2000, and I took it bit further to 2100-2200 with precision software.- Never goes above 65 in temp.- Ran all UHD benchmarks at 60 FPS or better","Cons:-Nothing, it took me a while to catch it in stock.",Other Thoughts:I'd recommend this to anyone gaming at 1080p.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"yeah, this is the 1080p card to have",2016-08-12,"Pros:Cost, power efficiency, small size, quiet, cool, 1080p >60fps ultra everything. literally twice the average fps of my evga 770.fast sync is also fantastic for quicker high framerate games.",Cons:no backplate? idk it has no cons XD,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Excellent, small size, high performance GPU",2016-08-11,"Pros:Size: Perfect for my new mITX build. Had a GTX 980 In there, had to cut the case and squeeze that sucker in. The 1060 sc, however, is so small installation was a breeze, with tons of room to spare.Power: Low power consumption compared to my GTX 980 for comparable performance output.Noise: hardly audible during gameplay, unless you're making it your job to listen for it. Impressive regardless, especially for a single fan unit that cools as well as a dual fan unit.Cooling: Low steady temps. This thing runs at 61 degrees Celsius for the entirety of my gaming sessions on ultra graphics at 1440p.  It is excellent, especially given it's small size and single fan.","Cons:Looks: Has the same look as older gen EVGA GPU's in the ""mini sc"" model line, such as the GTX 750 sc. Not so much a con, as it looks pretty nice, but if we are nit picking for the sake of it, the lack of style upgrade from previous gen model is basically the only thing I could come up with.No SLI: Not so much a con of this specific card, but more of the new gen GPU line from NVIDIA. As an enthusiast I love SLI'ing cards and other unnecessary PC mods, and I'm a little bummed out I'll never be able to do it with new gen GPU's.","Other Thoughts:If you need a card that will perform excellently on demanding games on high graphics and at high resolution  and in a small form factor to fit into tight spaces do not hesitate for even a moment. This bad boy sells out FAST. Don't settle for a similar mini, like the one from ZOTAC, as for essentially the same price this model is superclocked and higher clock speeds."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,AMAZING CARD!,2016-08-10,"Pros:This EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING is a great card for the price!Powerful, small and quiet.Very happy with this purchase.I was worried mine will come with a coil whine or noisy fan like others have experienced. But no, very silent card.",Cons:Nothing really for the price,"Other Thoughts:When I first plugged it in my PC wouldn't post, just froze up. To get around that, i needed to reset my bios with clear cmos button, and all worked after that. Also the EVGA PercisionX OC software is very useful, give you much control over the card. You can tune the fan speed down or up. I have mine set to 0dB up to 40 degrees C."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great purchase!,2016-08-10,"Pros:- The size of this thing is great, very compact. Huge reduction in size switching from an r9 390x.- Powerful, this card is really great and around the same performance of the 390x I had, but even better in some games. Fps also seems a lot more consistent and I am not having any huge dips as I did with my other card. I am getting amazing performance in all games very high to ultra/max settings in 1440p.- I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about on the other listing for the non SC, this thing runs very cool. It has never gotten past the 60s on full load and some games I'm not even breaking 50 C. This card runs super cool especially with a single cooling fan. And I'm switching from an AMD card, my case actually blows out cold air now :)","Cons:- Wish it had SLI support, but that would be overkill and would probly outperform 1070s maybe a 1080 for cheaper?","Other Thoughts:- This is a great card especially for the price, I would def recommend it.- The performance, size, and low temperature of this card is amazing for the price point."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"Great card, really annoying fan.",2016-08-10,"Pros:Runs Witcher 3 close to max settings (foliage ""High"" and Hairworks ""Off"") at 1080p with near constant 60fps. Should set one for 1080p gaming for years to come!","Cons:The fan ""clicks"" and is audible during more silent parts of gameplay. Completely unexpected of a new product and obtrusive enough to warrant the low rating. Also does not run as cool as expected, but at least has yet to peak over 85C at 50% fan.","Other Thoughts:Review updated to reflect impressions after the card has been put through its paces. Simply put, the EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC is a beast of a card marred by the lottery pick of a lemon fan."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing!,2016-08-09,Pros:- Fits perfectly on my mAtx case- Is always silent even while heavy gaming- Delivers pure 1080p on maxed settings on every game I throw at it- The compact design is a plus- Easy to install,Cons:- None so far,"Other Thoughts:When it comes to Evga products, you can't go wrong because of their power usage and sleek design. Overall, I am very satisfied with this card since I will be mainly be gaming on 1080p due to my monitor. I would definitely recommend this card!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great so far,2016-08-09,"Pros:Installed without a hitch.  Performance, size, power consumption all miles better than the failing 5870 it replaced.  Should handle whatever I throw at it 1080p good settings for the foreseeable future.",Cons:None yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing,2016-08-08,Pros:CheapNot loudSmall size,Cons:Nothing yet. Maybe the lack of LED if your into that.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Difference is night and day,2016-08-08,"Pros:-Coming from a Radeon 280X, this blows my mind how buttery smooth my games are-i play on 1920x1200 60hz and this is all i need to play all my FPS games on high/ultra and still get great frames-CS:GO over 150 frames, BF4 over 70 frames, GTA V over 50 frames (all on custom high/ultra settings)-i never knew the biggest difference actually are the sharp dips of frames when complicated rendering is needed and my 280X -would have great frames but suddenly drop to 30 if something big came on the screen, the 1060 never goes below 45 on GTA V (which is saying alot) and it never stutters. BF4 is ALL ULTRA and average like 115 frames. it's so great-fan is quiet-new bios has feature to custom fan curve 0% speed fans on idle (AMD cpu can't flash new bios yet)worked right out of the box-OC is so easy, +140/+250, still quiet, still cool, still <70 degrees celcius","Cons:nothing really, maybe had a cool led","Other Thoughts:has no leds on the gpu that is why its one of the cheaper cardsdon't think 1 fan can't cool this card, it cools extremely well and quiet"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Extremely happy,2016-08-07,Pros:QualityFastEfficientNot as expensive as other 1060sQuietNo coil whine,Cons:Only one fan? But still stays pretty cool so two fans may be overkill,Other Thoughts:Had the gigabyte g1 gaming 1060 and suffered from excessive coil whine and a loud fan. The evga has been perfect since day 1.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,The Best 1080P Graphics Card,2016-08-06,Pros:I have absolutely no doubt concerning the reliability and performance of any graphics card from the EVGA brand. I also liked how it came with a free poster. I love free stuff.,"Cons:Do not buy this card for 1440P or 4K Monitors. I recommend the GTX 1070 or GTX 1080. I personally expect to be using this card for the next 2 years. During that time hopefully 4K monitors, Virtual Reality, and processing power of graphics cards card will be a little more mature and affordable for mainstream use.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,pure pwnage,2016-08-04,"Pros:Very fast, plenty of VRAM, very quiet under load (silent at idle).",Cons:not a 1070,"Other Thoughts:EVGA support has got your back, just remember to register your card. I've dealt with them numerous times for the various cards I've owned, and they've been great every time."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best GPU I ever owned! Exceeded all my standards.,2016-08-04,"Pros:-Fan is super quiet.-The gpu boost is amazing, boosts to over 2000mhz at times, and temp doesn't go over 70C-Compared this card to my friend's RX 480, this card kills it at all DX11 Benchmarks, we both have win7, no dx12.-Very cheap for the performance, got the card in 2 days.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:If there would be an SLI option for GTX 1060, I would most likely go for SLI. But I guess put together both cards in SLI, they maybe would outperform a GTX 1080."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, quiet, reasonably affordable",2016-08-04,"Pros:Physically short, fast, cool, quiet, efficient. Great value compared to last generation.",Cons:4gb 480 may be a little better value.,"Other Thoughts:Seems to be about 75% faster than the 960 it  replaced @1440p, allowing for max detail in Grim Dawn and not dropping below 40 fps. At factory speeds, boost runs just under 2000 MHz for me. Temperature is very good. Even after playing for extended period, temp peaks around 61C and remains very quiet. I gave it another little bump on clock speeds (60 MHz core, 800 MHz memory) and ran Unigine Valley for a while and it topped out at 68C.  For those concerned about its single fan cooling, don't be. Every site that has reviewed this card comments on how surprisingly cool it stays with a single fan. It is also (obviously) very short. If you can fit a dual slot card, this thing will fit lengthwise. I have not flashed the new BIOS for the passive cooling at low load (perhaps only idle) but it is available. This card at time of purchase did not ship with this feature.I prefer NVidia and EVGA in particular to AMD offerings. With that being said, reviews seem to bounce all over the place with the 1060s versus the 480s. Most have the 1060 ahead a little up to a more comfortable lead. Some sites have them virtually tied in performance, while none that I have read show the 480 with any meaningful lead (overall). The 4gb 480 seems to be the value leader @199 and the 8gb seems to be a tossup with the 1060 based on its slightly lower price point but also slightly lower performance (again overall). Efficiency of Pascal is well documented as being tremendously better than Polaris (AMD). If this is important to you or your psu is questionable, the 1060 really is the only consideration. I personally am very happy (excited) about the purchase and use of this card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,quiet little card,2016-08-03,"Pros:This thing wipes the floor with my aging Radeon 6950, using much less power. 1080p gaming at max settings is a cakewalk just as advertised, and some less GPU-heavy games like Guild Wars 2 are easily playable at 1440p and 2160p.The easy BIOS update from the EVGA forums lets me spin the fan at 0 RPM. It's idling at 40c and 0 RPM in a room with no air conditioning right now. In furmark 1080p the temperature is 71c at 64% fan speed and still very quiet. Rest assured the single fan is enough to efficiently cool a GTX 1060, and splurging on a more expensive GTX 1060 with two or three fans is probably unnecessary.","Cons:I'm not a big fan of EVGA's PrecisionX OC software. EVGA wants you to sign up with personal details and give the card's serial code before installation, and MSI Afterburner is still more to my liking.","Other Thoughts:The plastic shroud on the left side of the card is too close to the clips in my old case, preventing them from snapping down to secure the card. Keep in mind my case is from 2009, and I'm also being lazy since I can rely on a thumb screw instead of the clips. I'll update when I receive a new case in the coming weeks, but I doubt this is going to affect anyone else.Update: It's a perfect fit in my Fractal Design Define Nano S. There's about 1 cm clearance between my ATX PSU and the card, but this does not seem to have had an effect on temps due to the good ventilation.Can't comment on overclocking potential just yet, as I currently have no use for it.The cable that came with mine is a 2 molex to 1 PCI 6 pin, not the one pictured by Newegg. This also doesn't affect me."

This EVGA 1060 SC is an amazing card for its price, small PCB factor, coolness, quietness and performance.",Cons:none,Other Thoughts:I was able to buy this card using $25 off paypal promo code.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2016-08-03,"Pros:Noticeably faster than my R9 280x.  My son needed something better than the ancient HD4870 he was using and I couldn't bring myself to pay for an ""older-but-better"" card that would still work with BIOS for him.  I passed my 280x to him and grabbed this.  I had wondered if I would need to upgrade my 2.5 year old AMD FX setup in the next year, but I can say that I have no reason to do so at this point.  I run vsync because I can't stand even the slightest tearing so I'm really only judging by my system's ability to sustain 60fps@1080.  Doom, Just Cause 3, Final Fantasy 14, and a few others - all max settings and buttery where I had to turn a few things down before with my 280x (or live with some lower frame rates.)  There is one game I tried (still in alpha and under NDA so I can't specify) that I had to turn the shadows down one step from max.I have no beef with AMD and my choice of this over a 480 came to availability.  I am seeing some benches that put this a little ahead of the 480 but the pricing seems to reflect that appropriately.This is a fantastic card for the MSRP.  Don't pay gouged prices.  Wait for the stock to level out if you need to.  Unless you're doing >1080 or are serious about VR, this is the new sweet spot.",Cons:Had to replace all my mini-displayport dongles with regular displayport for my extra monitors.  Wish they would stick to a standard from one generation to the next.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Cool, quiet, efficient, compact, fast",2016-08-03,"Pros:Upgraded from two EVGA 960’s in SLI.  This single card is about as fast, but uses far less power and is totally silent even when gaming.  I only play one game regularly—GTA V, and it runs smoothly at 60fps (1080p) with the regular settings maxed out (no advanced graphics).29W system power usage idle at desktop (measured at wall)100-120W when playing GTA Vi5-3570k o/c to 4.0GHzGigabyte Z77 motherboard12GB of 1066MHz DDR3Samsung 840 SSDAntec 430W Earthwatts p/sWindows 7 Pro x64Cooler Master Hyper TX3HP 27xi 1080p monitor","Cons:I had to register at the EVGA forums to download a special bios that makes the fan stop when idle.  This feature was standard issue on the 960’s, so why did I have to go through such a hassle to get it on this card?  I hate cleaning fans, so this is one of the most important features to me and should be standard industry wide.","Other Thoughts:Probably the best graphics card I ever owned, and I’ve been buying them for 20 years, since my first Canopus Pure3D 3Dfx Voodoo!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,New life to my system.,2016-08-02,Pros:This card is awesome. Over clock ability is great. Super quiet in my system. Small form factor.,Cons:None so far.,"Other Thoughts:I have a AMD 6 core processor with 16 gig of ram. This card has given new life to my system. Haven't checked frame rate but have played Evolve 2, Doom demo and Skyrim so far. All I can say is WOW. I have not overclocked this card and I don't need to. These games run super smooth on ultra and high settings. I highly recommend this card."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Perfect when low energy and low heat count,2016-08-02,Pros:Higher overclock than most other designsSmall form factor; better internal air circulation and great lookExtremely low load tempsExtremely low power consumptionGreat AestheticsBest value GTX 1060,Cons:A back plate as an add-on would have made it perfect,"Other Thoughts:Have 4 running in my VM server.  Chose GTX 1060 because of the low energy and heat when sitting so many in a case side by side.  They also look outstanding with my black and silver theme.  In a lot of images the highlights look white, but they are mirrored silver.  The small form also looks great with my design because it allows some of the accents of the motherboard to shine when they would otherwise be covered.  I laugh every time I see giant and expensive versions of this GPU will full length heat sinks.  Those solutions are so far overkill,  The only goal they hit is to drain your wallet..  Plus this little guy comes with a higher factory overclock than most of those."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great upgrade for and old system,2016-08-01,"Pros:- Runs GTA5 beautifully on an 8 year old quad core system, using only 45% gpu at 30% power (1080, very high settings).  The  game is now CPU bound on a Core 2 QX6850.- Runs 90W lower under idle and load than previous card (ATI 4870)- Compact size- Nice hardware monitoring tools with EVGA's OC Precision- Copper heatpipe cooling-Nvidia Experience driver software auto-optimizes game settings",Cons:-None so far,Other Thoughts:-3 yr warranty from EVGA-Great performance boost for an old system and limited time to play
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Product and Great Service,2016-08-01,Pros:Easy to Install and Setup.Performance is top-notch for the value of the card,Cons:Additional Over Clocking of card not for beginners.Fan runs constant at 40% even at idle,Other Thoughts:Looking for a great GPU card for the value then this is it.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,awesome,2016-08-01,"Pros:This card is fantastic. I finally got around to replacing my SLI 570s from years ago and this card has completely revived my rig. It's quiet, runs cool and has freed up a ton of space in my rig.","Cons:The mounting didn't fit my case quite right and I had to opt for a zip tie instead of screws to hold it in place, but that's not a big deal.","Other Thoughts:Awesome value, really impressed with this little power house."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Works & sounds great,2016-08-01,"Pros:Quiet & effective cooling - it's the 'old' ACX 2.0 cooling solution, but it is more than enough for this gpu. i run it 24/7 folding and it stays around 70C and at around 50% fan speed. I cannot hear it over the case fans.Good boost out of the box - Boosts to 1950 MHz while folding without any modification to clocks or power.Overclocks seemingly as well as any beefier card that's been reviewed (runs a-ok at 2050 MHz).Looks good and small sizeGreat power draw (<125 Watts)","Cons:If you want fans to drop below 40% (e.g. stop spinning when card is not in use), may have to update the BIOS. evga have a quick executable to do this, but it's an extra step and buyers may not be aware of this option.",Other Thoughts:There's lots of options out there for the gtx 1060 - I would definitely recommend this and don't see a compelling reason to spend $20-70 more for a more advanced cooling solution given how this performs.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Awesome Little Graphics Card!,2016-08-01,Pros:- Single fan but very silent at max speeds of 1500rpm- Temps never seem to go over 67C during gaming- 0db fan idle mode makes it even more silent- It can overclock up to 2.1 GHz stable- Able to play pretty much all games at ultra 1080p 60fps- EVGA step-up program is there if I ever wanted a better GPU,Cons:More of a nitpick but I'd prefer the power connector to be on the side instead of the top since this is already a small card,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very good performance for incredible price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Much faster than my previous card which was a 270x. I have a 4K TV and this card connects via HDMI 4K@60Hz no problem. Can do 60fps+ at 1080p/1440p easily, some older games like Dirty 3 even run at 4K 60fps with everything maxed out. It works very well also with a more CPU intensive app like FSX/P3D, in big metro area like KLAX the CPU (i7-6700k) is now the bottleneck and having a more powerful GPU would not help much in this case.Runs super quiet, with bios update from EVGA the fan would turn off at idle which makes it perfect for HTPC usage.","Cons:No SLI support, dx12 performance still to be determined in future games.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing card for the price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Insanely cheap card that runs better the gtx 980. Out of the box it was over clocked to 2000 mhz, after using EVGA's over clock tools on their webpage I was able to run a stable system at 2101 mhz with a memory bus of 2302 mhz. This overclocking made my computer literally 500% better when compared to my old gtx 745 4GB in the 3D marks firestrike and timespy benchmarks . It is able to handle 1080p with 60 frames a second when the settings are maxed on every game I own, some examples are Total War: Warhammer and Sniper Elite 3. The install was easy and Nvidia's GeForce Experience quickly and easily installed the drivers for the card. Altogether it took me about ten minutes to be up and running. I have not had any issues with overheating, the hottest I have had it run is 65 Celsius but that was while it was overclocked with the standard fan speed.  Normal my temperature sits somewhere around 55 Celsius when I am just playing games.","Cons:The only possible issue there could be is that it only has a 6 GB cache, right now that's more than enough but it doesn't future proof it as much as I would like.","Other Thoughts:Completely worth it, incredible price to power ratio."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great Card, Great Performance",2016-08-01,"Pros:the EVGA Geforce GTX 1060 SC Gaming is as good as advertised. It is automatically overclocked, and able to be OC'd further with Precision X. What's more is it functions really well. In my system it replaced a GTX 760, and is more than twice as fast. It runs reasonably quiet, and is so efficient while taking up a small footprint.",Cons:No downside that I've experienced. It is an excellent card for a good price,"Other Thoughts:I've only used it on DX11 titles, not interested in any DX12 currently, but have experienced close to 1080p 60fps throughout without overclocking. The exception to that rule is the Wither 3, which sits at about 52-55 without oc, with oc it is a flat 60 with everything on max but hairworks"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Awesome Card for a Great Price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Impress Card with impress performance. Runs great and quite even with a Single fan. Max temp i have seen under a full load for over a full hour has been 65C. This is with a normal fan curve since 0db fan mode makes me nervous but that's just me. Doesn't bottleneck my 3570k @ 4.0ghz. The newest games I've used with this game are Doom, Mirror's Edge, BO3, Unreal Tournament Alpha, Killing Floor 2, and a few others. All games run 60+ fps with no issues.","Cons:I haven't found any yet. After a week of usages, I'm pretty happy","Other Thoughts:EVGA is always a stand up brand. I replaced a EVGA SC 770 4gb card with this. The 770 was given to me from a friend and is now in my wife's computer. Before she got that, she was still running my old Evga 570 Blower card. The thing still runs great to this day after countless hours and years of gaming on it. And now it's going to find a new home in the minecraft pc I am building for my nephew who is 5 years old. Thank you again for a fantastic product. Hopefully I will be upgrading my mobo and cpu in a few years, and I really hope to switch my mobo to EVGA as well. Thanks again!"

The link to the download is in the EVGA forums. Happy Gaming!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Dream card.,2016-07-31,Pros:+ small card. makes working on PC easier.+ quiet. no coil whine.,Cons:-login required for evga precision software,Other Thoughts:Upgraded from 7950's Crossfired. This card trumps those cards and at much less power and heat. Been revisiting all my old games turning them to ultra. Vermintide runs 'ok' on ultra but that is a poorly optimized game and still surprised it runs as good as it does.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing  performance for the price.,2016-07-30,Pros:- Amazing performance- Amazing price- Quiet fan- nice stock overclock,Cons:I honestly can't cay anything bad about this card. the performance is outstanding for the price.,"Other Thoughts:- This is a huge upgrade coming from my gtx 760 sc.- I was worried about getting a single fan, but there is no big difference at all."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,It's good...but could be better with a some kind of GDDR5 heatsink solution.,2016-07-30,Pros:1) Well built2) Came with port plugs3)  Quite4) No coil whine (at least on mine),"Cons:1) No heatsink and not even a thermal pad on GDDR5 chips? On no you didn't EVGA! Memory chips should be cooled! They reach temperature of greater than 90 degrees, look here: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060-pascal,4679-8.html So I am disappointed about that.2) Where the hell do I find the BIOS update for this thing on your website? I see the driver, but the bios? Simple things like these should not be ""searched for"", make it happen - with a click!3) Cut on useless paper & posters in the box...help save the trees.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Simply Amazing,2016-07-28,"Pros:Unbelievably quiet. The new BIOS allows 0 RPM operation but even when benchmarking on high or ultra settings it cannot be heard over CPU and case fans (which are running at low RPM settings. The performance is amazing, Without OCing it exceeded the boost speed. Never exceeded 65 Celsius. It is so small it really needs no backplate. I was worried but unless you plan to really overclock this I see no need, With Precision X I don't see why you can't get the base clock close to 2000Mhz. I play everything at 2560X1440 very smoothly (now if it would aim for me).","Cons:Could it be free? Seriously at $249 after rebate it is the best performance for the money I have ever seen in a gaming card. Combined with the low temps, quiet fan, and low power use, it is amazing.It was a little weird to have no drivers or utilities or a CD at all included and very minimal instructions. The plug and play experience was good but it replaced a NVidia card. I guess EVGA figures everyone has a nice internet connection and knows what they are doing.","Other Thoughts:I have to say the weirdest part is pulling my old but still nice EVGA GTX960 SSC out and replacing it with a card half the size that performs SOOO much better.  If you are upgrading any card at that level or below you will be very happy. Don't forget to flash the BIOS, it is painless."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card for the price ever released,2016-07-28,Pros:Runs extremely silent and cool and handles 3 1440p monitors no problem,Cons:Wish it had SLI,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2016-07-27,"Pros:Small, quiet and sips power. Punches above its weight in performance, maxing out most games at 1080p/60. My particular card is a capable overclocker, running at +110 core +520 mem. Build quality seems excellent, and XOC is easy use (Afterburner, etc, also work).

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Incredible value and performance,2016-07-27,Pros:- Small- Powerful,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from an EVGA gtx 660 to this EVGA gtx 1060 SC.  The performance increase is incredible, and the price can't be beat.  When they say this card delivers more than the gtx 980, they were not kidding.  Install was a breeze, I just swapped the cards out and let the NVidia control panel install the latest driver (custom install > clean install) and away I went.  About 15 minutes total time to upgrade and start gaming.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who cannot spend $500 to buy the 1070 or 1080, and would purchase myself again in a heartbeat."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, Efficient, Cool running GPU that packs a lot of value for the money",2016-07-25,"Pros:Back Ordered this card on Tuesday's launch. It shipped on Thursday and arrived on Saturday, 3 days ahead of schedule. Once installed I fired up gpu-z to see how it was doing in idle and gaming states.One note, my AC just went out so the ambient air temp here is 95 degrees F, 35 degrees C. At the desktop, nothing else running, idle temp is 40 C. After gaming for an hour or so the temperature went to a max 61 C. For a delta of 5 C and 26 C for idle and gaming respectively on this 1060. On my old card, an HD 7850, the delta was 10 C and 30 C respectively.Boost 3.0 would allow for a stable 1950 Mhz clock while gaming in stock condition. It would idle at 253 Mhz. The fps of the 1060 was a bit more than 3x that of the HD 7850.I used a kill o watt meter to measure total system power draw with old card (HD 7850) and this one. With the HD 7850, the computer was drawing 48 watts at idle and 148 watts while playing Diablo 3. The GTX 1060 SC meausred 38 watts at idle and 88 watts while playing Diablo 3. The power draw for the 1060 while playing Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4 was 180 watts and 130 watts respectively. So this card will vary its power use depending on the games you play.My games play very smooth using this card and the card consumes a bare minimum of power and runs at very low temperatures while doing so. I think the EVGA GTX 1060 SC represents a terrific value for the money and should provide enjoyable gaming for years to come.",Cons:None that I can think of.,Other Thoughts:My Computer's specs are as follows:I7 6700K 4.0 GhzCryorig H7 UniversalGigabyte Z170 Gaming 716 GB GSKill TridentZ DDR4 3400 Mhz500 GB Samsung Evo 850 SSD Boot/Gaming480 GB OCZ 150 trion SSDCorsair HX 750WEVGA GTX 1060 SCFractal Design Define SWindow 10 Pro

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product for the price.,2018-11-18,Pros:-Fast-Small-Relatively quiet-Only requires a single 6-pin PCIe power-Has the firmware that doesn't shut down the fan-About 10-15% faster than the EVGA 970 SSC,"Cons:-I payed MSRP.-It won't make me a cup of coffee in the morning nor give me a hug when I'm feeling blue.-I think it's dying...every now and then, (no real rhyme or reason) the screen will fill up with a pattern of faint white dots and streaks.  This may last for a few seconds up to several minutes, then everything will be fine again.Edit:  It was the monitor that was dying.","Other Thoughts:I bought this to replace my EVGA 970 SSC which went to my little sister. I wanted something that was a little more power efficient and had a little more oomph. It certainly met up with my expectations, aside from the minor nagging problems with the patterning on the screen. Power consumption in gaming with my core i7 4790K rarely exceeds 200W at the wall."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card for it's price and size,2018-11-17,Pros:-had it for almost a year and no problems-great cooling for a single fan-fairly quiet-love the double ball bearing fan,Cons:-none yet.,Other Thoughts:-definitely would buy again if I had to
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card,2018-11-12,Pros:Limited volume (not too long)Only (1) 6 pin connectorWorks great on in a Dell XPS w/460W PSPriced well with rebate,Cons:None yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,works as expected,2018-11-11,Pros:works as expected. great product. competitive price. thank you.,Cons:n/a,Other Thoughts:n/a
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Good card, but slightly noisy fan",2018-10-22,"Pros:Easy to set up - plugged it in, turned PC on, ran NVidia graphics driver updater, done.Small - looks like it would fit in just about any PC (but check with the manufacturer before cramming it in a mITX case)Powerful - this card has more than enough power to play anything I want (though I only have a 60Hz 1080p screen). I'm glad I went with the 6GB version over the 3, since it's not much more expensive.","Cons:I think this is typically of all single-fan powerful cards, but you can almost always hear that fan going, especially under load. It's not like, really loud, but you can definitely hear it over any of the other noises in your computer. If you've got the dough, I'd get a double-fan version. But if you're on a budget and/or you don't mind a little fan noise, it's not too bad.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Buy this card from Newegg,2018-10-04,"Pros:- Small factor- Fans do not go over 1300rmp under load and are silent- 22 C idle; low 60's when playing games- Evga has great customer support, which alone is worth it","Cons:- Got this card locally cause I couldn't wait for delivery.. big mistake. Card was running 45C idle, and 80C under load. Fan was going 2800 rpm and sounding like a leaf blower. I couldn't play games even with my open ear headphones on.","Other Thoughts:Local retailer CanadaComputers didn't want to replace the card under 14 day replacement warranty, they said it is final sale (contrary to what is stated on the product page). Did RMA with EVGA 2 days later I got a new card that is running great.Kinda wish that I got the proper card the first time around, but still cannot take an egg off."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great video card!,2018-09-06,"Pros:Well built....small, compact, stays cool and works great!",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Works great with my MSI Z370 M5 Gaming MB!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful but NOISEY,2018-09-04,Pros:Far exceeds my expectations. Runs everything I've thrown at it with Ultra/Extreme settings.,"Cons:LOUD when running bigger games. Seriously.. You might think a miniature jet is taking off from your computer. Not enough to take a star off, but something to keep in mind if you want a silent rig.","Other Thoughts:From all the research I've done, this card is the very best price to performance value at the moment.EDIT: After close to a year of use, this thing is still going strong and performing so much better than I ever expected."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It does what it does and does it well,2018-08-21,"Pros:Out of the box, it posts decent temps and isn't a power hog. Farcy 5 on all ultra settings w/a few modifications to bump up frame rates; ditto for Battlefront 2 and the Wolfenstein titles. It benchmarks decent FPS numbers in 1080p settings. I got this a entry/mid level build for my rig since I'm still pretty new at PC building, so this gave me what I desired at the time. I wasn't expecting blazing 4K gaming or was going to demand 3D rendering that a 1080 Ti would do without breaking a sweat.  I've been learning as I go with overclocking and this thing sure has taken a beating and hasn't quit yet.","Cons:There are some comments, but nothing that would make me take an egg/star away.  Tends to get a bit warm (75-77c) when overclocked, but that could also just have been the small form factor and just normal for a single fan card. I also didn't play with the fan curve. I kind of was hoping the ""EVGA GEFORCE..."" lettering on the side was LED, but it's not. Not many people like that, but I do. No backplate for bling or heat dissipation. XOC desn't allow for much tweaking with this model GPU, which I guess is understandable for an entry/mid level card.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to someone. Just don't expect it to give you gtx 1080 FPS or get blown away with 4K graphics. Only two things I'd change would be to give it a backplate and that cool LED light for the lettering on the side. Other than that, it's a solid buy."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Quality product.,2018-08-10,Pros:Great performance.Super quiet.Convenient size for MT builds.,Cons:None so far.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,RMA'd twice,2018-08-09,Pros:- Runs well for 1060- Lowish heat output,"Cons:- My first card (brand new) broke after 4 months of use, it fans stopped spinning and black screen on post.- My 2nd card (refurbed one they sent me via RMA) broke after 1 year, DVI port stopped working and eventually card stopped output","Other Thoughts:I'm not sure, when this card works, it works very well for the price point, but I've gone through TWO of them in 2 years and I'm not overclocking, they have proper cleaning/air cooling, etc.... The RMA process is a nightmare for Australia to Taiwan office because they never pick up the phone (english, if you select Chinese they pick up immediately).A bit bummed because I've already spent 100$ in postage sending the RMA's back to the warehouse which means I could have bought a 1070 at this point.  I asked for a different card and both times they've sent me refurbed models that seem to break.My warranty is almost at the 3 year point and I'm afraid this 3rd card will break and I'll be out of luck.This is my 4th EVGA card in my lifetime (25+ years of gaming) and it might be my last sad to say. :("
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,This thing performs like crazy!!,2018-08-06,Pros:Runs really strong and decently cool. Sits around 65°c at full throttle.,Cons:It could look a little better.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this as kind of a filler until I could get a 1080ti or the next generation gpu when they come out. Now that I've got it and overclocked it, I don't know if I can justify upgrading. With all epic settings on Ark and some settings like shadows and sky effects turned down, I'm getting anywhere from 50 to 100fps easily. It's definitely putting me in a hard spot to upgrade..."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Aye,2018-07-13,"Pros:-EVGA swag is undeniably cool.  (Love their customer service.)-1080p on 1092x1024?  No problemo! (I might be getting older - but - I'm content with monitor as it is.-I turned on V-Sync and kept it on.  This plays all the current AAA titles like butter on bread.)-Below $300-Efficient and compact, baby!  (There's nothing quite like being able to remove power cords from a case.)","Cons:-Might only last a couple years at max settings in certain titles, but coming from a 760GTX with a stock of games I'm still enjoying from this generation - I'm not too worried.   (My next big upgrade will probably finally lift me off from the x58/1366 chipset.  Until then I have plenty left in this rig to get me by and so will you.)","Other Thoughts:It's louder, but not annoyingly so.  I was worried it'd be a jet turbine on liftoff compared to my dual-fan solution.   I haven't OC'd or messed with settings, but I hear it has some further potential there, too."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Its EVGA, don't think twice",2018-07-04,"Pros:Tiny card, packs a punch",Cons:its not a 1080ti,Other Thoughts:This thing is screaming to get cranked out with VR. Runs beautifully and does a whole lot of work while fitting more than comfortably in a mid-sized case. For someone who wouldn't typically overclock the SC does just fine.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Pretty beefy card for the price/size.,2018-07-02,Pros:It was pretty plug and play. Update the drivers on this baby beast and ride the dragon. It plays all my games at max setting and looks great doing it.,"Cons:Idk, I guess a con is that it's not a 1080?",Other Thoughts:I do recommend this little guy. It's compact and awesome.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Small, Tasty Card",2018-06-28,Pros:Good speed and quality you expect to get from EVGANice dust covers for ports that are not being used.,"Cons:It is an ""older"" technologyConstantly sold out (but that is because it sells fast)",Other Thoughts:The fan isn't THAT loud. I've never come across a system or component that was truly silent or quiet.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful little card,2018-06-27,"Pros:Its a small, powerful card.  1080p Gaming this is a card i'd recommened as long as your willing to turn down some settings sometimes to keep the frame rate up.","Cons:While small is a pro, its also a con in this case.  The small heatsink and fan make the card rev up a bit to stay cool.  Runs warmer unless you set a fan speed profile yourself to a higher level.",Other Thoughts:Good card all around.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great GPU,2018-06-23,"Pros:- Easy Install- Idles at 40, and under max load it's usually 69-71- Runs all my games on ultra between 60 - 150 fps (Modded Skyrim / Fallout 4, Doom, GTA V, Tetris, Pong)- No Coil Whine or other problems","Cons:- A bit more expensive than it used to be, but neither Newegg or EVGA are at fault for it obviously. $350 after taxes isn't bad for what I needed.- Fan is pretty loud when running games at Ultra with high frame rates, but it doesn't bother me because I wear headphones. It may be irritating to some people.","Other Thoughts:My first graphics card was a GT 660 (which could do little to nothing) and then I upgraded to a GTX 750 Ti (which could play old games like Portal and Bioshock), and finally upgraded to this. I had upgraded every other part of my PC but never got around to the GPU until now. To be honest, my main dream was to play modded Skyrim without going under 60fps, and this card was exactly what I needed. A little late for Skyrim hype, huh?The only reason not to recommend this card is the fan noise, but if you wear headphones like me, you won't notice it. I'm very satisfied with this GPU."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very Pleased,2018-05-18,Pros:Easy InstallFeels sturdy (some of the long 2 and 3 fan cards can feel too flexible)Nice upgrade for this PC (from an R9 380x that died)Low power consumption.,Cons:Price (but that's all graphics cards re; cryptomining),Other Thoughts:Replaced a dead card on the Frankenstein PC (made up of other PCs parts). So far works great and is a noticeable upgrade.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It's great!,2018-04-28,"Pros:- I got this for 380 cad when it was on sale, it's a good card, it's small and compact, which is a bonus. bigger doesn't always mean better, this card performs really well even though it has 1 fan.- Can run battlefield 4 ultra in 120+ fps- Can run battlefield 1 ultra in 90+ frames- Can run fortnite ultra / high in 150 - 250 frames- Since it's 6gb it can serve you in the long run, it also future proofs it as new games will eventually consume more vram.",Cons:- Everything is fine so far.,"Other Thoughts:- Would recommend to people who would like to play on high / ultra, because this card can handle high settings.- Overall a great card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good card,2018-04-28,Pros:PerformanceBrand6 GBSmall size,Cons:High price right now,Other Thoughts:This card performs well and had 6 gb which is great for future proof. It is also small so it will fit most cases. EVGA is a good brand for video cards and well recommended. If you can find better price go ahead. You have to check everywhere and do price match when available to save a bit. I got mine under 400 cdn. I remove a star for the high price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product! High Price.,2018-04-25,Pros:Everything works fine and it is a great GPU,Cons:The inflated prices from cryptocurrency are a bit sad.,Other Thoughts:I bought this around Christmas and its still going strong.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing graphics,2018-04-16,"Pros:I’ve never been able to play a game on ultra settings with solid 100 FPS and no frame drop. Amazing. Really feels like this piece of hardware was put together well, somethings you can just feel in your hands and know it’s not cheaply made.",Cons:The price made me want to throw up but I bought it anyway. Lol this thing is LOUD under load. Sounds like your PC is about to get ready for liftoff as soon as you start gaming. Maybe the loudest I’ve ever heard for single fan GPU.,"Other Thoughts:Installation was cake. EVGA XOC software is somewhat confusing but manageable. I recommend checking out the fan speed settings, options are quiet mode etc. The card runs hot normally hence the high fan speeds even with good air flow in the case. Check your temps and maybe game with headphones. The only time the fan kicks into tornado mode is under ultra settings in games. Oh yeah I wish the crypto people would go away so gaming gpu prices can be reasonable again.Cheers"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card choice for less money,2018-04-15,Pros:I have used this card since it was released and I have not been let down. I have gone head to head with other flagship cards like the 1080ti and I had better performance. This card boosts up to 2113MHz if it is liquid cooled and stays under 25 degrees Celsius. This card has no problem handling 4K resolution without a significant drop in fps.,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a good quality card like the 1080ti but don't have the money, then this card is for you."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic!,2018-04-06,Pros:-Runs Nearly everything on 1080p ultra-Low power consumption-Several EVGA programs and Nvidia program accessibility,Cons:-No VGA port,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,THE MIGHTY MEGA mini MACHINE,2018-03-14,Pros:Can run current gen games no problem.,Cons:4k Bottoms out a bit but that is expected. I run full 1080 Ultra everything on a 4K TV.,Other Thoughts:HUNT : Showdown almost at Full Settings no problem!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Easy 23MH for this card,2018-03-14,Pros:-Good for mining and gaming as well-Low power consumption and low noise,Cons:- Can't any find as of now any flaws,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance and a good price.,2018-03-10,"Pros:Excellent Performance. I was looking for a reasonably priced card that would play most games at no less than 60 fps at high settings. For the games played in my family, this has far exceeded those expectations.Price was competitive compared to other cards in the 1060 family. Nearest card with comparable specs and reviews was fifty bucks more.","Cons:None so far. I've been running it less than a week. If anything changes, I'll update the review.","Other Thoughts:Easy to install. The only problem I had was finding one of the 6-pin power cables for my modular PS.  Obviously, not a fault of the card. It came with a install DVD, but my rig has no player, so I had to download from GeForce's website. Easy to find, and no issues there. Card came up in default resolution as expected. I ran the install, and it's worked flawlessly since."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,hynix memory on evga lol,2018-02-28,Pros:performance is good unless you are unlucky and got a card with hynix memory like I didit's does run hot but not that much for single fan it's a pretty good cooling and it fits in my mini itx builds just fine,Cons:fans are loud under load like annoying loud (I read reviews saying fans were quiet haha I don't think they are quiet unless you are deaf just saying),Other Thoughts:I have 3 of these on builds but my very recent card has hynix memory prices went up for 300 to 359 and for what from micron to hynix downgrade lol ok evga I think it's time to switch to some other company now
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,These Video cards arent as fast as they use to be when it comes to mining Ether :(,2018-02-21,"Pros:Unfortunately, there isn't anything that I can say that's positive.  I spent way more than twice of what its worth and it underperformed others of the same make and model number!  Yes, there is a positive!  Now I know not to buy this model of video card anymore.","Cons:For whatever reason, Out of the box they only put out 15.3 MHs instead of 19.8 MHs when mining Ether, that's about 18% drop in MHs from previous cards of the exact same make and model?","Other Thoughts:Don't buy this card if you plan on using it for mining Ethereum, waste of good money.  If You're a gamer, it's probably fine, just expensive like all of the cards out there."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great product but the fan is indeed loud!,2018-02-18,Pros:Great performance for the price!Very small will fit in any tower that's for sure.Replace my GTX 760 2GB and I definitely see a big difference. Most game can be played on Ultra and High settingsBF1 is between high and UltraPUBG is mostly on ultra and some very low setting like foliage XD helps u see the sneakers in the bushFallout 4 ultra all the wayYou get the idea !,Cons:Fan was ok at first but after a few weeks it started to be loudly noticeable! But only when playing games it does!I just put my headset or put the music louder on speakerMy towers' fans were already loud but that just beats it !Maybe I would have bought the double fans gc instead but you just get used to it !,"Other Thoughts:If you have an old geezer card like mine was with 2GB, I definitely recommend you buying this card you won't regret it!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing little card,2018-02-15,"Pros:-Runs very quietly, even under load-High framerates in every game I play-Low power consumption-Small size",Cons:-Runs a little hot due to single-fan design-Not a 1080 Ti,None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,One of the best cards I've had,2018-01-29,"Pros:-Small length, only 6.8 inches, so it leaves space inside the case. (I'm using a Phanteks P400)-6GB, better than 3GB for graphic-intensive games-Easy to install-Mine came with an EVGA poster, thanks EVGA","Cons:-Noticably loud during intensive gaming, (Can't really hear it whenever I have my headphones in, so it doesn't bother me.)",None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing card but giving me some issues,2018-01-24,Pros:This card eats every game I play with ease. PUBG runs great maxed out at 1080. I don't really have any intense games but i'm really happy with what it can handle for me. For only having one fan it stays pretty cool and the factory over clocking is really nice.,"Cons:Whenever I start my PC cold, I get multiple issues. Sometimes one of my monitors is at 800x600 while the other is at the native. Sometimes one screen is black and the other has artifacts, and usually neither screen has any picture. When I hit the reset button, both screens come back just fine.It's not a terrible issue but it shouldn't be happening and I'm worried it's a precursor to the card failing down the road.","Other Thoughts:It's a little loud when games are running, but with headphones on who cares?If I wasn't getting the display errors this card would be 5/5. I'm so glad I bought it before these insane price increases and shortages."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great buy for the price (this was when I bought the card),2018-01-23,"Pros:Small size, low power, pretty good performance",Cons:Price increases since I bought the card,"Other Thoughts:I bought this card for my son just a month ago and a month later it is 2x the price.  I'm saying it now, unless this changes, this will end PC gaming as we know it.  I bought my 1070 almost 3 years ago for $429 and today that same card is nearly $1,000.  This is to nVidia and AMD:  you guys might like the prices now, but keep in mind game developers are looking at the future and if I'm a developer, I'm building my company around consoles and maybe porting a stripped-down version to the pc.Consoles can skirt the cryptocurrency wars by having their GPUs built directly for them so that only their products can use them.  That keeps the prices down.  I do see console prices going up to reflect GPU price increases, but not the 100% markup I've seen over the last month with discrete cards.  This has been going on for 2 years now so if this doesn't stop soon, PC gaming is dead.  No way would I ever buy a 1060 for the prices they are fetching now.  My son would have to make due with the 670 he had and just turn down settings.I said this when CUDA first arrived that I could see video cards costing thousands because the performance of a typical video card today is far, far, far, far more powerful than even the best servers CPUs.  I worried even then that video cards would be the new CPU where code developers used the GPU to run everything from servers to crunching algorithms (like password breaking)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great if it keeps its drivers,2018-01-22,"Pros:Great for 1080p gaming, 200+ fps on Counterstrike, 70+ fps on Playerunkown and sorta good for mining.",Cons:My device manager seems to always give code 43 whenever I try to boot up Garry's Mod and It gives me a Microsoft Basic Render Driver whenever I boot up Insurgency.

T,Cons:None so far after 30+ days of use.,"Other Thoughts:his is a siginificant upgrade to my AMD Radeon 6870 1GB card. I was in CrossFire set up, but so few games actually take advantage of that and then one of the two cards died. Was relying on just the 1 Radeon for a while til its fan died. I had actually replaced the fan on the other card that died a few years ago. Anyway, rather than replace the fan (again), I opted to just bight the bullet and get the card.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performer.  Loud by Default,2017-12-15,Pros:- Performs as it should.- Small profile with respectable cooling performance.- Great customer service from EVGA.,"Cons:The default fan curve is a bit too aggressive for my tastes.  Fan speeds ramp up to 50+% before the card even hits 70C and it can be pretty loud.  This is easily remedied if you use MSI Afterburner or other control software.  Once I made those adjustments, the card was much quieter with only a couple of degrees increase in temperature.  Other than that, I have no issues with this card.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING 6GB,2017-12-05,"Pros:Stable 60+ FPS @ 1080P in most current games.Good looking cardSmall Size, fit in any case.","Cons:LOUD LOUD LOUD IT'S VERY NOISY AT FULL LOAD,And if you try to adjust fan speed ( with afterburner or EVGA Software ) it will result in more heat (70+ C).",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,A bit finicky but still amazing,2017-12-03,"Pros:Extremely powerful for its price (Able to run DOOM on Ultra with no issues)Small, so it fits effectively every form factor MOBO (aside from ITX)","Cons:Mine had a weird incident where it became unrecognized by Windows though I believe this was due to the 11/30/2017 driver update NVIDIA put out as I had no issues until the day after I'd applied it. This required me to run off integrated graphics (or a separate GPU if you lack integrated graphics), uninstall the card through device manager, then reinstall after shut down.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card!,2017-12-03,Pros:- Great performance.- Small size fits in most cases and enclosures.- Reasonably priced.,Cons:- Noisy out of the box. It's very quiet until the fan speed reaches 50% speed.,"Other Thoughts:For anyone complaining about the noisy fan, use MSI after burner or any kind of overclocking tool and set the fan profile to quiet mode, or manually set the fan speed to 50% max. The gpu temp will increase to mid 80s, but the fan noise is pretty much inaudible."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wonderful flexability,2017-12-03,Pros:-Preforms well overall-Keeps rather cool for a single fan GPU-Plenty of connections for multiple monitor setups,Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Swell!,2017-11-30,Pros:- 60 FPS on all my games.- Quiet.,Cons:- Nothing yet,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic video card!,2017-11-22,"Pros:DIsclaimer:  I use these for mining crypto coins, and am seeing these run 24/7 at max capacity.  I currently have a total of 24 video cards mining.The heatsink design on this card is much more efficient than it's competitors.  I also purchased the 3GB version of the EVGA 1060, and here's how they perform:Out of the box mining Zcash with EWBF miner (stock settings):1060 6GB - 325H/s @ 65C1060 3GB - 280 H/s @ over 85CWith the GPU clock at 2050(ish - it varies a little while running) and MEM clock at about 4500.1060 6GB - 330-340 H/s1060 3GB - 300-305 H/sIn conclusion, this card runs about 10-15% faster out of the box, and is at least 20C cooler while doing it.  I see complaints about the fan, but I'm not seeing it here.  These run literally all day long, OC'd, and none of them ever even approach 70C, and I have yet to see one running at over 50% fan speed to keep them that cool.","Cons:Because of idiot miners like me, these cost more than they should.  No cons about the card itself.  Again, this thing is fantastic!","Other Thoughts:Buy it.  For gaming, for 3D modeling, or for mining.  You won't regret it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card when you're limited on space,2017-11-16,"Pros:Great card, runs everything well. Never goes above 70 degrees. Silent operation on most games.",Cons:The fan is very noticeable on games such Overwatch and Battlefield 1.,"Other Thoughts:Definitely recommend this card for those that are limited on space. It would be nice if the fan was quieter on games that push the card. Given the performance, I would buy again."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge perfomance in a small package,2017-11-16,"Pros:Small form factor, Well built solid card, Easy to install, ""Worked in my NON-UEFI Motherboard"", Very Quiet, Low power usage, Very low temps, Came with excellent software package for easy driver installations and game setting optimizations As well as Precision-XOC for effortless overclocking, Came with a poster, stickers and a badge to show off your love for EVGA and Nvidia.","Cons:After installing on windows 10 i could not open nvidia control panel, it would say there was no Nvidia graphics card installed. Had me worried at first. I had to dig around a bit, not much though, I find out it was disabled in windows device manager by default. I don't know if this is a windows 10 issue or if this is done to avoid driver or other issues, so it might not really be a con as this might not be the case for everyone. But right-clicking the card in device manager and selecting enabled did the trick.","Other Thoughts:Shipping was amazing, only 2-days ground domestic, and was packaged very well both by Newegg and EVGA.

What a difference, I can't even put into words how much. Even with my older hardware this changed gaming for me i a big way. I am so happy i decided to go with EVGA. I used to be a AMD\ATI guy but this has affected me so much, I could never go back. I would definitely recommend this product. Do yourself a favor buy this card. 6GB is worth the extra $."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,small and great overclock,2017-11-15,"Pros:Small card, very good overclock on memory",Cons:Noisier than the 2 fan ones but still very good noise level,Other Thoughts:With more and more game going 4gb+ textures it's worth the extra cash to get the 6gb version!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Terrific graphics card!,2017-11-15,"Pros:-Very simple to set up, configure and install-Runs most all old games at ultra settings, and new games at high and ultra settings at 1080p, as well as 1440-Quiet, efficient and well designed","Cons:- Some of the software that allows clocking configuration has a bit of a learning curve and isn't entirely intuitive, but with some practice it makes sense.",Other Thoughts:Highly recommend. The perfect high-end card for those on a budget.  Performance is superb
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card,2017-11-15,"Pros:Great performance for a small factor card, quiet and cool. Full load temps @ 60deg with fan at 50 percent.",Cons:None that I can think of.,"Other Thoughts:At first I wasn't too sure about this card but shen it went on sale, I decided what the heck. My main concern was if the single fan was going to be enough to keep the card cool at full load. To my surprise it does but I think that it helps that I've got a case with 5 fans running."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nvidia still makes a great product,2017-11-05,Pros:Easy installNvidia reliability and featuresBeautiful and well performing,Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:A very strong card. I don't game nearly as much as I used to, but I have noticed I've been playing more and more after building a new rig a couple months ago.Been on a GTX 550ti for years (still works, still a relatively good card) in an old box with all outdated tech and it was really unenjoyable. I chalked it up to me getting older and not caring as much but actually it was because I didn't realize just how horrible the experience was.Anyway, the card is great and I just ordered a new 24"" 144hz 1ms IPS to compliment it. Been on an old 21"" 60hz TN for quite a while and believe if you have a card this great, might as well get as much as possible out of it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent,2017-11-03,"Pros:- Fast card, can play any games I play at highest settings 1080p (Fortnite, Overwatch, PUBG, etc.)- Quiet. Fan turns off when idle during cool temps. Automatically turns on and adjusts RPM under load.- Small, fits in my mATX case very well and leaves plenty of room for other things. I love smaller card for the better air flow also, this was one of my best choices.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 6GB EDITION,2017-10-22,"Pros:Pros:Small cardDecent clock speedSingle fan, but perfectly adequate for the cardNever goes over 70 degrees, except for heavy gamingLooks cool",Cons:Cons:Only had it a few weeks but nothing wrong as of right now,"Other Thoughts:If you are thinking about overclocking, or are running intense games or programs, consider a dual fan version such as the dual fan EVGA or the NVIDIA windforce edition"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card for the money,2017-10-14,"Pros:- Much better single fan cooling solution then the non SC EVGA card.- Plays everything at 1080, you'll have to turn down settings if you want to support a 144hz monitor though.- Can barely hear it running.",Cons:- It's not a 1080 Ti.,Other Thoughts:Using the standard shipping this took about a week to get to me in Edmonton from BC. Yey Canada post.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid entry mining card,2017-10-14,Pros:Really great card if you are looking to start doing crypto mining. Stock rates for Ether are about 19MH/s and you can overclock to 22MH/s. You can even reduce the wattage down from 120W to 90W and still get 22MH/s.,Cons:none,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Just wow,2017-10-14,"Pros:Plays ANY game at 1080p/60fps ultra settings in 2017.Aesthetically pleasing and colors match any build.Not that huge, bulky thing that takes up so much space in your case.Very quiet.",Cons:No backplate.No SLI supportCan't really do 1440p at 60fps across the board on ultra. Comes pretty close though!,Other Thoughts:I've had this card now for about 3 months and I am beyond pleased. Worth every single penny. If you are looking at building a mid-range build with a single card then this is no doubt the card for you. This sucker packs a wallop and don't listen to the clowns that say you do not need 6GB VRAM and to go with the 3GB. I have already ran into a couple games that do indeed use up more than 3GB.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good gaming card,2017-10-13,Pros:- quiet- only one 6 pin pcie needed,Cons:- a little loud when fan at 100%,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Rock Solid as usual for EVGA,2017-10-09,Pros:-Quite-Powerful-Small-Load temps where fantastic,Cons:-If you want something pretty to look at through your case window might go for something else (maybe dual fan version)...?,"Other Thoughts:The stock specs put it at ""Core Clock 1607 MHz"" and a ""Boost Clock 1835 MHz"" but putting it under GPU load for hours, *my* card never got higher then 75c and stayed stable at 1925MHz under its own boost with no overclocking. Got really lucky with this card, it boosts farther and runs cooler then it seems most consumers have gotten. This is my *use case* situation and your mileage will vary, regardless its such a great card for the price.... IF that price can stay near is MSRP.... Or you can catch it on sale ;)I never noticed any real noise even at full load, custom fan profiles going above 60% fan is gonna make noise regardless though, and with a fan profile maxed at 100% it would boost to 1980 on it's own which is super impressive for the card.VR-StuffYes it can do VR and do it very nicely, keep in mind though its at the low end of VR. With it you can get started with and enjoy most VR games  (without SS being adjusted) and plays great. This card with a Ryzen 3 can get you a VR system for under $500-$600 which is way better then it was a year ago.Your standard games have enough articles and youtube videos on the subject but to simplify, Plays games at 1080p flawlessly with often high-epic settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good video card,2017-10-08,"Pros:- Good video card for the lowest model from 10xx- Not very noisy (my case is also silent so that helps)- You can tune it with software- Supports all types of features (nvshield, geforce optimizier, VR etc)",Cons:- Don't expect to run every new game on highest settings. I run WoW on 10 with FPS drops in raids sometimes.- Nothing else as cons. Pretty good video card overall for its prize,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Really good !,2017-09-27,"Pros:Love it , plug and play temps are good and really good fps",Cons:only 1 fan so when its get hot the fan make a good amount of sound,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great for 1080p Gaming. Maybe a Bit Overkill?,2017-09-27,Pros:-Running most games at high/ultra settings easily over 60 fps paired with an intel i5 4690 and 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz Ram. Feels good man.jpg.-Overclocked it over 2000Mhz clock speed and over 9000/4500Mhz VRAM. Not too shabby!,"Cons:-Really don't have any negative things to say, just nitpicks like:-No backplate to help mitigate the card drooping/warping from it's own weight.-More overhead for overclocking would be nice, though not sure if it's just my card though (silicon lottery).-The Price. I got this for ~$270 (minus S&H). Granted this is the SC version but still.","Other Thoughts:So out of curiosity and boredom, I enabled Nvidia's Dynamic Screen Resolution/DSR for 1440p and 4k resolutions. I ran Prey with 4k selected and most settings to high just to see what my system can handle (and a couple of features like motion blur disabled, vsync off, and AA at x2). What I got was ~30 FPS in the Shuttle Bay. Granted it's not native resolution, and there wasn't much going on, but still that was surprising to see. @1440p, I got around 70 fps with the same settings, so I think this card can handle it fairly well.The non SC version should work just fine as well, so if you want to save a bit of money you should get that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very solid card,2017-09-26,"Pros:Great Price-to-Performance Ratio.Not too big. People call it tiny, but it's not!Relatively quiet. Can get a little loud at fan speeds over 60 percent.",Cons:No back-plate!More CUDA cores would have made it truly great. 1200 plus is plenty but 1600 or 2000 would have been even better for professional applications.,"Other Thoughts:I have used this for mainly playing Arkham Knight at Ultra settings and it blew my mind but that is not my ultimate goal. My main focus was to use this for rendering in Maya and maybe compositing, but so far I've only used it a few times to model in Maya and did one single walk cycle with a dog and those are hardly stressing on the system and the graphics card. So the jury is still out on the professional capabilities of this card. If it performs at the same level as a 980 card, so I know it won't disappoint. At first I was going to get me a WX 3100 Radeon Pro card for 3d and animation but when I looked at the benchmarks and realized how much more powerful this was for a little more, I bought this. But I am hopeful it will hold up well. Considering that most people buy Radeon for value, this card currently makes any RX card pointless in a price to performance ratio, until this Ethereum business slows down and those RX cards go back to the prices they were when they first came out."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,stops computers from working,2017-09-21,Pros:nice graphics while it works very quite and compact,Cons:after about six months it stopped working and stopped my computer or any computer its plugged into from booting up,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Very Loud,2017-09-10,Pros:-Small: Fits into a mATX case with room to spare-Powerful: Almost as good as the 980 for a fraction of the price-Low Power: Only requiring one 6 pin PCI-E plug and 150 watts makes it a good upgrade without having to get a new PSU,Cons:-At 30% fan speed the temperature is above 80C yet the fan is somehow louder than the stock fx-8350 fan-At 90% fan speed the temperature is around 70C but the fan is so loud it can be heard through headphones,Other Thoughts:-If you can fit a bigger graphics card in your case I would suggest going with a two fan version of the card-Any fan speed over 30% sounds just as loud so you might as well go the full 90% in you want your card running any lower than 80C
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-08-31,"Pros:-Fast, plays overwatch at max at 90-130FPS-Works well with my AMD FX-8370-Can play any game I play at high to ultra settings",Cons:-Not a GTX 1080ti,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,tiny monster,2017-08-23,Pros:small...its only 6 inches but don't let the size fool you this thing is very powerful runs games no prob smooth and sexy.,Cons:no backplate if your into that sort of thing.,Other Thoughts:catch it on sale and its even a better deal.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Great card at a great price, but loud.  I regret not paying a little extra for a full-size and quieter card.",2017-08-03,"Pros:Some of the best price per performance, while leaning just a little into the ""more power"" area.Nvidia card for a G-Sync monitor.Every ATi card I ever had back in the day burned out, on one component or another.  Been rockin' Nvidia for years and years now with no issue.","Cons:This card is too loud for my tastes.  It's annoying.  Even over loud game audio on headphones.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy the small form card just to save a little bit of money (my case is massive; saving ~$20 was the only reason).Still, I will only dock it one egg because it's still a great card at a great price.","Other Thoughts:The REAL thing that drove me here was to do just a little bit to spread the word about the rebate cards EVGA is offering.  They give you a choice: check or debit card - choose the check.  I have yet to find a place that will accept the card, and I'm getting pretty aggravated with it.  I'd have paid $30 to not have to go through this hassle."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"This card is a beast!  Small, compact, 6-pin power, fast GPU!",2017-07-31,"Pros:Pros- small profile- 6-pin PCIe power- quiet fan- No need for OCing, fast out of the box, never exceeded 70C.- Takes load off your CPU, no more bottlenecking- 60-120 FPS every game ULTRA settings.- Vulkan API built in, frame rate doubled with DOOM 2016.- future proof with 6gb of ram- still super fast on old PC with PCIe 1.1","Cons:- No thermal pad on VRM but no problem with overheating, don't worry about it.- Geforce Experience Application is junk.  Had issues with drivers and kept crashing during latest update version.  Solution = rollback drivers, then reinstall update, choose custom install, check GPU Driver and PhysX only, check clean install.  Problem solved.  This is my only reason for giving it 4 stars.",Other Thoughts:This card has transformed my computer.  I'm running an older PC 2008 with dual 2.8ghz (8 core) CPUs (E5462).  My old graphics card R7 250X 1GB couldn't keep up.  The CPU kept bottle necking and the frames would drop.  I started to realized maybe my computer was too old or it was the graphics card.  Instead of building a new PC I bought the card first to see if it would make a difference and let me tell you this GPU is incredible!I used to struggle running DOOM 2016 and Battlefront.  I ran low graphics on everything and now since installing the EVGA 1060 SC 6GB I can run everything on ULTRA settings with min 60-120 FPS.  My computer no longer bottlenecks and it's like I have a brand new machine.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"good card, runs well but having issues with fan and heat",2017-07-23,Pros:-runs 1080p 60fps quite well,"Cons:-either my s340 case or this 1060 was slightly defective because screwing in the card required me to bend the back of the case with considerable force-idle temps are usually fine, 40-50C but when playing gpu intensive games the card can go up to the high 70s and is very loud, almost like a small hair dryer in my case",Other Thoughts:-might look into liquid cooling this with the kraken g12
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING - 06G-P4-6163-KR,2017-07-19,"Pros:Small and fast, and I only paid $189 for it from Newegg back in the middle of June with free next day shipping. I got this as an exchange for a defective card, the model I sent back was out of stock when they were setting the exchange up. They offered me this card for the same price as the one I returned. It was the first and only time in 17 years that I returned an item to Newegg.I'm very happy with the card and Newegg's service. The card is overkill for me but I wasn't going to pass up a great deal on it and it will be in my system for at least the next 4 years just like my last one. I don't upgrade as much as I used to because I don't play as many games as I used to, as in I hardly play any now.",Cons:None.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,Acting Up,2017-07-14,Pros:Great GPU when it works.DayZ Standalone gets 150+ FPS on very high settings,Cons:I'll load up any game and then after roughly 10 minutes of gaming all of a sudden the GPU will crash and the fan will jump to 100% speed. It happens every time and I am extremely disappointed.,Other Thoughts:I spent $250 on a card that doesn't work but for about 10 minutes of gaming...
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great thermals and no clearance issues.,2017-07-11,"Pros:The size of this card was the most influential part of buying this card. Another factor is that i have seen it go to about $230 ( after rebate) . It also overclocks extremely well, i got it to do a 300 mhz  without changing anything else and just left it cause im not to experienced with overclocking and it stays under 60 c the whole time after hours of gaming. And the ambient temps are 77-79 F ( side panel off) .","Cons:From what i have seen i will say that the rx 580 outperforms the 1060, but if you really want some of the features of geforce experience or your case doesn't fit a standard  sized card ( because all of the rx 580 on the market now are about 9 inches or bigger) or you are a green team fan boy then go with the 1060.","Other Thoughts:If you buy a 3gb version than you cannot call it a true 1060, more like a 1055 ti. just buy the 6gb version instead of making your system ram do your gpus job. But consider the rx 580 even if you despise the people who make mini little silicon ovens over at amd."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2017-06-30,Pros:- strong enough to handle most anything I throw at it.- video memory to spare.- despite being a single fan it runs fairly cool. Only hits 55c running Forza Horizon 3.- insanely quiet.- lower power draw than my previous card.- small form factor.,Cons:- the steadily climbing price.- had to fiddle a little bit with bios settings to get it working properly with my motherboard. Enabling the PCI legacy mode did the trick.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Eh, it's OK",2017-06-28,"Pros:Pre overclocked is good, decent performance for such a stubby little card, cooler seems effective enough for me.","Cons:GeForce Experience is an awful disaster, for some reason cs go runs like horribly shutter sputter 15-25 fps.","Other Thoughts:I got it before the major price hike. Don't install GFE well you have to to get the free game but get rid out it after. Like I said cs go runs horribly but Just Cause 3 runs great so the card isn't defective it's something wrong with cs go. I have both the Rx 580 8GB and this GTX1060 6GB my old card was R9 280x 3GB, the 580/1060 really are the new mid level cards for 1080p.Temps and noise aren't too bad very cool ambient 66-68f  %100 load runs 65c fan %51, warm room 72f+ the card ramps up the fan to try and keep it no more than 70c so it gets a little loud but not as loud as an old single fan HD6870 I have.Over all it's an interesting little card, if you get it for a reasonable price it's fine and realize that a single fan card is a little louder than dual and triple fan cards it's just common sense."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-06-26,"Pros:- Very powerful for it's size.- Great quality, you can tell it's a great quality card just by it's weight.  It's pretty heavy for it's size.- Plays all my games on ultra setting in 1080p at >60FPS.","Cons:- People have complained about the noise of the fan, but I can't hear mine at all with it running at full load.  I think it's because I have great air flow in my case, so it doesn't get hot enough for the fan to ramp up.  So in other words, so con's for me.","Other Thoughts:I'll be honest, when I first saw this card, I immediately disregarded it because of it's size.  I wanted a full size SSC or a card with at least 2-fans.  But with the prices going up on the other cards right now, I had no choice but to purchase this card.  Well, I have no regrets what-so-ever.  This card runs cool, and performs absolutely amazing.  I love it, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a powerful graphics card at a good price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice card,2017-06-24,Pros:- small- 6-pin power connector- 50-100% better fps vs GTX 660 while also moving graphics from medium-high to ultra,"Cons:dvi -> display-port adapters don't work, if your running dual dvi use a dvi to hdmi adapter.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic. Runs cool and super stable.,2017-06-20,Pros:Great mid range card. Runs pretty much everything I throw at it at over 100 FPS on Ultra settings. Super easy install.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:If you want a card that will run everything on Ultra for the next 2 or 3 years you got your card right here.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-06-17,Pros:Very powerful for it's price,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card, especially for it's price to performance ratio."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Awesome!,2017-05-05,"Pros:FPS on Overwatch with an I3 6100 on epic is 90-170! On Ghost Recon Wildlands and on pretty high settings, it's like 55-100 ish. Upgraded from a 750TI which would run 60-80 FPS on Ultra settings in Overwatch. Ghost Recon is a really pretty game!","Cons:The fan can be a little loud at times on Ghost recon, but it could be because of the lack of air flow in my case. It's pretty big for a smaller card, but it fit in my case so no worries.",Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend if your looking for a smaller card that will run pretty much all the games you play.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Good but not great,2017-05-05,Pros:- Compact form factor- Good price point for level of performance,"Cons:- Not terribly loud, but certainly louder than my GTX 460 Cyclone 1GD5/OC from MSI which was whisper quite because it didn't use these stupid air duct designs and instead relied on a large fan with heat pipes from the chipset.  That MSI Cyclone was rock solid and I would buy it again in a heartbeat if they refreshed its design for the GTX 1060.- I really don't like the air duct cooling  arrangement for graphics cards, but I have no other choice because I don't see anything like my old card on the market any more and I do not want to deal with the upkeep of a liquid cooled design.","Other Thoughts:- I bought this card once as an upgrade from a GTX 460 and it worked for a few evenings of gaming before dying and (it would appear) taking the motherboard down with it (I tried both the old card and the onboard video, but could no longer get a signal on my monitor).  I am confident that it was compatible with my system and well within the capabilities of my power supply, so it was very likely a faulty card.  The replacement card I received has so far been working fine so hopefully it was a fluke.  Though I much would have preferred not having to replace my entire machine in the process."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge upgrade from a GTX 760 at a ridiculously low price!,2017-04-23,Pros:Fits easily in mid sized case. Running new games on ultra quite easily. The single fan keeps temps well in cool range on heavy loads (Witcher 3 maxed including Hairworks) and is very quiet. A no brainer upgrade on a budget.,"Cons:Just wish this had LEDs, but that is just flavor :)",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wonderful little beast!,2017-04-22,"Pros:- Very powerful little thing- Small form factor is a HUGE plus for future builds- Only 150W TDP / PCIe Power cable!- Installation was a breeze. It worked flawlessly plug and play on my old S5520SC Mobo- Drivers were easy to install and worked out of the box (make sure to download from nVidia site instead of the provided drivers, and to use DDU tool to remove your old drivers completely before that. You can search google for DDU, it's easy).- Runs anything very smoothly on 1080P and Ultra settings.- Looks really ""sexy""!- EVGA support and community (a real plus)- EVGA software easily adjusts the fan curve or over/under clocks the card","Cons:Can't think of any, but if only it had a backplate that would be nice. This would prevent dust from accumulating on it, but that's barely an issue.","Other Thoughts:Coming from an old ATI Radeon HD 5770 this is a huge boost for my rig.I'm really happy I bought this, especially the 6GB version. This card is a huge bang for buck! I find it way worthy that the larger and more expensive cards from its tier.I can't imagine a better choice for 1080P gaming given the size and price. Just bear in mind that it's not designed for extreme 4K performance so don't judge it for that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic product,2017-04-21,Pros:Easy installExcellent performanceReasonably priced,Cons:I have no criticisms,Other Thoughts:I would absolutely recommend this product.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Finally Got a good Card!,2017-04-20,"Pros:-Pretty good price to performance, i haven't found a game that this cant run well",Cons:-The heat can get a little out of control sometimes,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Amazing GPU, for the price!",2017-04-19,Pros:- The GPU is very affordable- The Base clock speeds are very high- For a single fan GPU over clocks well- Stays cool even under high loads- Easily the best GPU that you can get for the $250 price range,Cons:- NONE!,"Other Thoughts:- Been running the card in 2560 x 1440 and have had no issues with games, playing most in high settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great little card at a slightly awkward price point,2017-04-19,"Pros:As a higher-end budget card, there's not a lot more you could ask for: performance reportedly approaching a GTX 980 for less than $250, plus a small form factor for convenient installation and a solid factory overclock. I put it inside a mini-ITX build to replace a dying 2GB 960, and now it plays Dark Souls 3 on ultra at a rock-solid 1080/60fps without even approaching max usage. With a custom, more aggressive fan curve, doesn't get over 70 degrees Celsius on the Heaven benchmark.EVGA delivers its usual no-nonsense aesthetics and good build quality (they even included a case badge!), and the smaller card fits in my Fractal Design Core 500 with plenty of room to spare (especially compared to the monstrously gigantic MSI card it replaced). The Precision XOC utility is handy too.","Cons:Gets very loud with fan speed over about 50%. I recommend headphones to drown out its tortured screaming.No LEDs, if that's your thing.As other reviewers have said, where this card lies in terms of performance is a little odd: maybe a bit more than what you need for 1080p, maybe a little less than what you need for 1440p. It's definitely not bad at either, but the RX 480/580 and the 3GB 1060 are only a little bit worse at 1080p for significantly less money. I probably wouldn't have replaced even my 960 if it wasn't for the thought of going through a month-long RMA process with MSI all for the sake of a card I'd probably replace in a year or two anyway.That said, if you need 1080p/60fps performance at max settings AND a small form factor, then this card is probably one of your very few choices, and likely the best -- so go ahead and grab it!",Other Thoughts:I'd probably pick this over ZOTAC's mini 1060s just on the basis of clock speeds.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Review for: 1060 SC Gaming ACX 2.0 Single Fan 6GB,2017-04-18,"Pros:Pros:Runs cool -- 28C-32C idle, 60~C while in gameQuiet fan (Unless you are running at 80%+ fan speed, and if you do - reconsider your life)Powerful card (I've yet to experience less than 60 FPS)Good price",Cons:No SLI,"Other Thoughts:Excellent videocard. Small, efficient and mostly quiet. Great video card for gaming at 1080p."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great mid range graphics card!,2017-04-18,Pros:- EVGA warranty- Runs cool- Perfect 1080p gaming card- So far no issues after 6+ months,Cons:- Price to performance isn't the best- None,Other Thoughts:This is a great little 1060 and won't let you down!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice and compact,2017-04-18,"Pros:This card uses lot less wattage for the power it puts out, easy keeps me above 60 fps in all my games",Cons:haven't found any cons yet,Other Thoughts:I would gladly recommend this graphics card
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Significantly better than my 960 SSC!,2017-04-18,"Pros:-Games look and run so much better than on my old 960 SSC.-Quieter than my old 960.-Smaller, lighter, and no sag at all.","Cons:-An SLI slot would be nice, but that doesn't affect me.","Other Thoughts:-It would be nice to be able to have the fan run without having to use PrecisionX. What I mean is that the fan does run, but only when it gets super hot, which I can't imagine being good for the life of the card. I could be wrong, of course. I'd like to not have to run PrecisionX just to keep the card at a temperature I feel is safe. Again, I could be completely wrong about what's good for the card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Outstanding Card,2017-04-18,Pros:Smaller sizeIncredible PerformanceLow Power ConsumptionRuns Quietly,Cons:Not worth mentioning.,"Other Thoughts:Bought to replace my 770 FTW (EVGA).  I needed a smaller card with a better power usage rating.  What I got was a card that met those requirements and doubled the performance of my 770 FTW.  According to the Heaven Benchmark Utility, the 1060 out performed my 770 by double.  I strongly recommend this card.  It has not had any issue running any games thus far. From Minecraft through DOOM it has done a very nice job."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card since the GTX 460,2017-04-18,"Pros:Price to performance reminds me of the GTX 460 days.  No issues at all in almost a year of ownership.  Runs cool, whisper quiet.  Perfect solution for 1080p setup for gaming amd graphic arts.  Single fan and short card made for a perfect micro atx solution.  No coil whine, folds like a champ.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Bought at launch amd has been in use round the clock since.  Looks dinky now that it has been moved to a full ATX case setup.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card - Fast and Quiet,2017-04-18,Pros:-Great price/performance point-Single-fan version runs quiet and cool.-Small card was nice and easy to install,Cons:-wasn't free,"Other Thoughts:-I was skeptical that I needed 6GB of VRAM, but was surprised how many games use more than 4. Glad I didn't cheap out and get the 3GB version (which is also clocked slower).-Not sure why anyone would need a 2-fan version."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product!,2017-04-18,Pros:- Small model with low power usage- Runs most of the games I play extremely well,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:If you're looking to run the hardcore games on max settings, this probably won't be enough. But for mid/high settings this is a great card for the price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,a tiny cannon,2017-04-18,Pros:small but strong,Cons:none till now,"Other Thoughts:Though I put it in a mid-tower case, it is definitely suitable for smaller case as the temperature is always low. Userbenchmark.com showed my  graphic card is beyond the average of 1060s before the 3gb version was released."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card. Great Value,2017-04-18,Pros:Performs as expected.Price is terrific.Size is convenient for small builds.,Cons:None other than high temps but thats fine in a single fan gpu.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2017-04-18,"Pros:It's a nice, compact card at a great price that made building a HTPC very reasonable. It's also going to be used for a VR headset in the near future.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product by EVGA,2017-04-15,"Pros:Powerful, small and compact.  Does a great job in my HTPC.  I have purchased 10s of dozens of EVGA products, I have had one fail (x79 mobo with faulty USB).  Wonderful product.  Exactly what I needed in my HTPC.","Cons:Due to my use of it in an HTPC, if the body was the same size and on the same plane as the back mount,that could be an improvement.  It is a tight fit in an HTPC case with the power cables coming from the top, or you could place the power cables coming from the back and heck, you got another 1/4"" height wise to play with.","Other Thoughts:Yes.  Whether it is for a budget gaming system, if you want to run VR, or if you use it like me for 4k streaming, well worth it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Wowzers!,2017-04-11,"Pros:I previously ordered the 06G-P4-6267-KR but due to poor placement of my SATA ports it just wouldn't fit! Just too BIG, so I got this card instead, and it is 6.8 Inches of PURE PLEASURE!I've got the performance of the larger card, but in a smaller package.",Cons:Heat dissipation is mediocre.,Other Thoughts:It's a great step up from the onboard GPU.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,exceded my expectations,2017-04-03,"Pros:This exceeded my expections . I was expecting a small cheeply made card , what I got was a well made , heavy card .  The heatsink on this looks like coper heatpipes and runs very cool at idle , in fact the fan is off at idle ! (cool ) I was suprised at the weight of the card this size . I bought this to run mass effect andromada and that is does , wow the eye candy is breathtakingI highly recomend this card the bang for the buck , build quality , and proformance are outstanding !!!","Cons:only one small con , the fan can get a little loud under load but is does the job very well if dead silent is what your after then this card is not for you","Other Thoughts:coming from a asus 950 to this wow ! I get even get better 2d quality , images look lke you could peel them off the screed"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Works Beautifully,2017-03-14,Pros:Built my computer about two weeks ago. I haven't had any issues with benchmarks yet. This is my first time building a computer and I'm not disappointed with the speed and quality this GPU puts out.,Cons:None as of yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Price to Performance,2017-03-10,Pros:Insanely fast for the price. Extremely compact for it's performance. Fit well into my case.,"Cons:Like others have mentioned, it can be extremely loud under load. My fan speeds were usually between 60% and 100% while running graphically extensive applications. This may have been due to case airflow limitations though.",Other Thoughts:Computer running this GPU:- i3 7100- Corsair 8GB DDR4 2400- EVGA 1060 SC 6GB [single fan]- EVGA 500W PSU- Silverstone SG13BDidn't dock an egg for audibility. Other [video] reviews mention it stays pretty quiet in cases with great airflow.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-02-19,Pros:I have a mini ITX motherboard and small form-factor case so the Heat output was a big issue for me. this card runs cooler then my old EVGA GTX 760 SC well on me to run Max settings I'm almost all games. can't recommend this card enough you won't be disappointed if your coming from an older card like I was.,Cons:the fan is loud if you run it up to the 4000 RPM Redline. that being said mine never goes above 50%,Other Thoughts:have the card for two weeks really happy with it
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Better Than I Expected,2017-02-19,"Pros:This card really is the king of 1080p gaming. Elite: Dangerous had been ranging between 24-60 fps with my old GTX 660 ti card and now runs a smooth 57-61 fps with the 1060 with most settings at Ultra and a few at High (VSync on). Card runs cool. The fan doesn't even activate until after about a half hour of playing Elite and then just barely. Haven't seen the temps go above 55 C under stock fan settings. Plays Elite, Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas effortlessly at max or near max settings at 60 fps.*UPDATE 2/19/17* Tried it with The Witcher 3 and that makes it run hotter, around 70-75 C with the fan going over 60%.","Cons:The only problem I had was that one of the two back panel screw holes didn't quite line up with the one in my case, but the other one did, so the card is locked down well enough. Just a minor irritation and could be my case's fault.","Other Thoughts:Smooth 1080p gaming, runs cool and quiet, what's not to love? If, like me, you were wondering if it was really worth it to upgrade from a 660 ti, go for it! It really does make a difference."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Card,2017-02-03,Pros:Great 1080p gaming,Cons:Does not turn on randomly after going into sleep mode while pressing key board or mouse; so have to hard turn off computer,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Yes, has no problem with 4k monitor.",2017-02-02,Pros:- It is really quiet...  almost as quiet as the fanless Nvidia 650 I had before I bought this.- Had 0 issues while installing the card.  Works perfectly after 5 days of use.,"Cons:- Performance improvement on games, over my old 650 card, is not noticeable except for ability run higher resolutions.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid upgrade,2017-01-30,"Pros:Best card I could fit in my stock HPHigh fps on multiple games, limited only by my monitorGreat value",Cons:If only a dual fan could be a little smaller,"Other Thoughts:Coming from a 750ti, this card is epic! Witcher 3 is very lush at 60 fps and doesn't drop below 50 fps on Ultra with mostly max settings in a fight."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Small But mighty.,2017-01-24,Pros:Normal EVGA quality without the stupid MLG/ROG/420 no-scope aesthetic. (if you know what I mean)Small- fits in almost all cases.Powerful- runs all modern titles at mostly high to ultra settings assuming 1080P resolution.Nvidia stability- never have driver issues on the green team.,Cons:Runs hot.Runs loud.,Other Thoughts:If space is not a problem then go with a full size card you will thank me.If you must go with a small card then you might want to under-clock this little guy for normal daily use as I find that it stayed hot even when under very little load.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good Product!,2017-01-23,"Pros:-Easy to install, as would be expected.-Arrived quick and in a sturdy box, so it wasn't damaged at all.-Software was easy to install as well.-Runs most sorts of games buttery smooth, at least for me!-Easy fit for small towers.","Cons:-Not actually the card's fault, but EVGA's Precision tuner absolutely kills performance on really nonintensive products. Paint.NET refused to respond, but this was easily rectified by just shutting off the EVGA program.-My box did not come with instructions on install, which is fine if you've seen other people do this sort of thing, but could really turn off a newbie who honestly wants to get into this without fear of damaging these 200+ dollar components. I took an egg off just for this.","Other Thoughts:I recommend this product to people who have the money to get the 6GB model. The extra 50 bucks can be a bit of a pain, but the extra 3GB of VRAM certainly will help the card survive a lot longer with other models coming out.I would have really liked to know a good estimate for power supply usage as a whole, not just recommended for this card; Thankfully I already had one strong enough to pull the card's weight.All in all, I will most certainly be purchasing from EVGA again in the future."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,The best video card to get without spending a ton,2017-01-20,"Pros:Battlefield 1 - Ultra detail with max 1920x1080 resolution on ASUS 24"" 144hz monitor.  Runs like absolute butter with zero lag or drop in framesCan't believe the size of the card and the power it hasMuch less fan noise then my old dual fan cards",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:For the size, price, and performance you can't beat it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 6GB,2017-01-10,Pros:-Small for small towers-The better 1060 (This)-Doesn't get crazy hot.,Cons:-Not flashy,Other Thoughts:-Only get a 6gb 1060 model. It is way better
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 SC 6GB,2017-01-09,"Pros:Wonderful product with compact design, amazing if there's little room to work with in the case and still gives amazing near perfect performance at 1080p res.",Cons:None that I have.,"Other Thoughts:Amazing buy for 1080p gaming users, 4k users, its good, but maybe something else is better."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good option for a budget 1440p experience.,2017-01-09,Pros:- EVGA quality.- Small size makes makes this an ideal upgrade for micro ATX builds and for cases with limited space.- Desirable frame rates and detail settings are achievable for 1440p gaming.- Relatively low power consumption.,Cons:- SLI is not an option.- DVI screws always come off when I unhook my monitor. (the screws unscrew along with the dvi),Other Thoughts:- 1440p gaming was achieved usingGTX 1060Intel Core i7 26003x4GB DDR37200 RPM 500GB HDD430 Watt PSUQNIX QX2710
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent Product,2017-01-01,Pros:-Excellent cooling capability-High factory overclock speed-Compact design,Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:-Comes with a nice factory overclock, so not a lot of manual overclocking here; locked voltage."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,1st gpu and very satisfied,2016-12-27,"Pros:This is the first gpu I've ever purchased that went in the first gaming level PC I've ever owned. I say this because I don't have anything to really compare it to.I can say that this card was the perfect choice for me. I needed a shorter card, and this one has the absolute best power to size ratio on the market right now.So far it runs ice cold and silent running 1080p max settings at least 60fps on GTA 5, Skyrim, ds3, steep, etc. 250+ on cs:go. I say at least 60fps because my monitor is an LG IPS 75hz, I just keep it in 60 with vsync on, because that alone is a monumental step up from even my ps4 pro. with vsync off, I get ~100+ fps on GTA 5 max settings 1080p.Did I mention silent and ice cold? truly",Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:I think it's too bad they didn't leave an option for SLI with the 1060 and down, but 1 is all I need anyway"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Small, Power Efficient, and Powerful!",2016-12-13,"Pros:• Packs a huge performance punch in a much smaller size than other GTX 1060's.• Even though it has a smaller heatsink and only a single fan, it still cools almost as well as other GTX 1060's.","Cons:Originally the card shipped with the 0 dB BIOS, which did not have that aggressive of a fan curve and made the card hot on idle and regularly reach 80°C under load. For some reason this BIOS is also incompatible with nouveau, and it was not possible to boot into Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10 without using my integrated graphics to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. EVGA a few months later then rolled out BIOS version 86.06.27.01.60, which solved all of these issues. The fan idles at around 20% speed now, but is not audible at all.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Simply great.,2016-12-06,"Pros:This is my first computer build, and I am so lucky to have built a computer in this time in technology. I have never tried any other graphics cards, so I can't necessarily compare with anything. All I can say is it's power is matching with the previous generations top dogs for $200 less. If you're coming from a 960 or a 970, you might be surprised with the difference (970 not so much, but you have the extra 2.5GB of VRAM to work with, so I'm not sure).",Cons:None thus far.,"Other Thoughts:It does tend to run hot while gaming without your own fan curve, but I would assume that most do. MSI Afterburner solved that problem, not to mention that I get to view all of my systems temperatures and usages alongside keeping my GPU cool. EVGA Precision XOC can also solve this problem, but you can't view all of your systems temperatures and usages with it, only your GPUs."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performance and a great upgrade in my case.,2016-11-28,"Pros:- Compact design ensures compatibility with most if not all form factor cases. (Used mine in Corsair 230t)- Low Fan Noise- Great Upgrade from a GTX 960, if you have a 960 or below (950, 760 ect) there is a great performance leap that is worth the upgrade.-Sits comfortably between a 970 and 980 in terms of performance",Cons:- None so far,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,A dreamboat!,2016-11-25,"Pros:Fast, quiet, compact!  It makes my system run a lot quieter and also runs noticeably cooler.  Handles all my gaming very smoothly.  I upgraded from an old GTX 480.  Very glad I did, while my old card served me well, this was a great replacement for it.",Cons:I don't get to use it more than I do now!,"Other Thoughts:(nothing to do with the card) I to flash my MB and update it and tinker with it quite a bit to get it to recognize the card.  Once I did, it was smooth sailing for a couple of months now."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING,2016-11-19,Pros:-More impressive performance leap from the 960 to 1060 than the 760 to 960 was.-Small size-Decent cooler/pipe array and  fan setup.,"Cons:-Fluctuating prices and availability.-Questionable Nvidia driver quality.-For a 1080p card, it's a little overkill. For 1440p, it's average.-No back plate.-","Other Thoughts:Great card. But for 1080p, you can go cheaper."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic Graphics Card for the Price,2016-11-14,"Pros:I bought this card before the holiday price spike (around $250). It runs fantastic, I've run Fallout 4/Skyrim Remastered/Payday 2/EU 4/CSGO all on max settings and this card doesn't break a sweat. FPS stays above 60fps, usually much higher since I only use 1080p (normal is around 90-100), and I haven't seen it rise above 60 degrees Celsius even under full load for several hours. It is also very quiet, I never hear the fan. The configuration software provided by EVGA allows me to overclock and set gpu AI no problem.",Cons:None really.,"Other Thoughts:During the holidays the demand (and price) for this card increases exponentially, as one would expect. I would hold out until you find it offered online at a decent price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Very efficient, High value, Small form",2016-11-04,Pros:Runs very quietRarely hear it at allLow power consumptionRuns stable at hotter temps,"Cons:Not as powerful as it's 1070 sister. (of course, not as expensive either)","Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card to people who are upgrading stock cases. It will fit in just about any mid tower I have seen. The thing is tiny in comparison to many other cards I have had. I have seen some people worrying about it's high operating temp, but honestly I think that is just its stable temp range. 5 eggs. Lots of goodies in the box as well."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good card,2016-11-04,Pros:Max out 1080P gaming great card,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:6.8 inches, that's what she said."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,More than enough for me,2016-10-31,"Pros:Small form factor, a lot of power, its fan is off all the time unless I'm playing a very graphics intensive game, which I rarely do.",Cons:I don't play enough graphics intensive games to justify such a nice card!,"Other Thoughts:I put it in a Raijintek Metis case. Fits perfectly, although I did put a blow hole in the top to help deal with it running slightly hotter than I wanted. (High 70 C to low 80 C when playing No Man's Sky.)"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product. Works as advertise,2016-10-31,Pros:-Price-Performs extremely well-Ease to overclock-Perfect for 1080p gaming-Runs quiet  even under full load,Cons:-None so far and I  have been running for several hours everyday while gaming since I got it and no hiccups of any kind.,Other Thoughts:-Would recommend to anyone looking for a very good card at a even better price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing FPS,2016-10-29,Pros:Replaced a hd6950 with this thing in my lga775 maximus 2 formula and I'm now playing the newest games with maxed settings at 60+ fps.-small form factor-good value,Cons:none expected,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance for 1080p gaming,2016-10-28,"Pros:-Great value if you can find the card in stock at close to MSRP.-Performance is pretty much flawless at 1080p-Very power efficient, which is the main reason I chose this over the RX 480. My 400 W (high quality) power supply works fine with this card. The card only needs one 6-pin power connector.-The fan is quiet.-Idle power draw seems to be very low. I noticed that the fan doesn't even turn on at idle.",Cons:Frequently priced substantially above MSRP.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING,2016-10-23,"Pros:Small in Size only 1 6 pin needed, Runs Cool",Cons:Drivers from Nvidia are unstable after hours trying to figure out if it was my monitor or the video card and trying 2 other monitors and installing multiple drivers all attempts failed. I should have waited for at least 6 months or longer till Nvidia would get the drivers ironed out,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Easy to install , easy to overclock ...  must buy for high performance at a low budjet",2016-10-23,Pros:SmallEasily Overclockable (Check jayztwocents overclocking video )VR ready,Cons:-no backplate,Other Thoughts:I replaced my old 680 2GB with this 1060 GB.I run Doom Division in ultra at 1080 at 60 fpsThe 6gb memory is good for texturing software such as Substance painter 2 when you start to have a lots of layers ..I'm not disappointed

Fry Cry 3 / 4, DOOM, etc.  Fallout 4 gets 60 FPS on ultra except for Diamond City.This thing does protein folding six times better than the old card (PPD now ~360,000):  Hits no higher than 74C folding and less than that while gaming.Boost clock goes up to 1960 MHz, but your results may vary.",Cons:Remember to take that stupid protective film off of the case.,Other Thoughts:Remember to a complete uninstall of your video drivers and install the latest driver from nvidia
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid.,2016-10-11,Pros:The best value GPU on the market (generally speaking).,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:I put this in a machine with a Skylake Pentium, and it can run World of Warcraft at maximum settings. So for about $300 you have yourself max WoW graphics."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Plug and play,2016-10-11,Pros:Purchased this for 1080p gaming and haven't been disappointed. Size of unit permits for unobstructed airflow within my Nano S case.  Using MSI Afterburner for tweaking GPU. Great experience. Idle @ 25c  Load @ 68c with aggressive setting.  EVGA BIOS upgrade available for semi-passive fan use.  No coil noise.,"Cons:Lack of SLI, LED or backplate.",Other Thoughts:Great bang for your buck.  Solid engineering and performance.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Value for the Price,2016-10-10,"Pros:- Awesome Value in this tiny card.  Mine came with the 0db fan bios, so was a simple driver download from the website, and i was up and running.   Plays all my games at 60fps, and they look amazing now!- Small size and only needs 1 6pin from the power supply has also cleaned up my case and increased air flow!- Stays cool using the default fan profile.  Have not felt the need to use a custom fan curve yet.",Cons:No Cons here.,Other Thoughts:Replaces a 4 year old HD7870 that decided to fail.  Could not be happier with this choice.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,awesome card,2016-10-08,Pros:-fast graphic rating when i bench marked it-super quiet fan at full speed-doesnt overheat very easily highest so far has been 48c-supports 4k i have it hooked up to my 55 inch screen tv and picture look great during game play- small form factor helps for better air flow in case-over clocking works great on it got my clock up to 2138 mhz and stayed stable and got memory clock up to 4666,Cons:- none so far only problem i had was with my skyrims enb not working but that was remedy by enboost though-no sli bridge which suck would deff like to buy another one to hook up together,"Other Thoughts:great card , great price would highly recommend to anybody awesome preformance"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card for LAN Rigs/small form factor PC builds,2016-10-08,Pros:- Card size will fit in most small form factor cases that accept full size riser cards.- EVGA great grapic card company that has wonderful support.- GTX1060 benchmarks..go look them up! This card will be standard in all my friends low budget PC builds,Cons:- No SLI support :(- No shiny LED lights,"Other Thoughts:Hey....stop reading reviews...put this into your cart, head over to EVGA to look at benchmarks, put your wallet up to the screen, and give them your money! This card is amazing. I plan on recommending this card to anyone who has a small form factor PC build, travels to LANs, goes to QuakeCon, takes their shirt off while gaming, drinks too much Jack Daniels. Really. you need a new video card your Voodoo2 just isn't cutting it anymore. It's time to upgrade! DO IT! DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS!!!!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wow nice card,2016-10-07,"Pros:EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING, played all  online games  at max 1080p res with great fps.Small card fit perfect into my  small case.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very easy to install and a great upgrade to GTX 750 Ti,2016-10-07,Pros:The size of the card takes up very little space in my system case and the power requirements are well suited to both general and gaming requirements.,"Cons:None yet, but I'll keep looking.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to anyone who is considering the jump to the GeForce 10 series cards.  While it may not have all the specs that a seriously hardcore gamer wants, this card is very well suited to the other 95% of the gamers out there!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 SC Gaming (SF),2016-10-07,"Pros:- Runs very cool in a mini ITX case (even with just one fan)- Low noise.- More than enough horsepower for 1080 HD (really...1080 HD is hi def enough for most of us mortals)- Will run most any new title at max or near max settings. (leaps and bounds ahead of cards from a few years ago)- Only needs one six pin for power.- Quality as expected from EVGA!- No LED's or excess junk.- Optional software to control fans.- Can be overclocked further (but why bother?)- Affordable and includes a case badge, some stickers and poster.","Cons:- Really none as far as I can see, does what it says on the tin and then some.","Other Thoughts:Bought this to replace a 3 year old GTX 760, it was a great card...got the 1060 for about the same price and it's far better, should future proof my gaming for a few years. Of course I use a 1920x1080 LED HD monitor so it runs that smooth as butter if you are into 2k or more then you should probably move up to a 1070, but for 1080 HD this 1060 is the bomb.Be sure to get the SC Gaming model the cheaper version has a cheesy heatsink and the SC is already OC'd.Been playing Fallout 4 on Ultra with tons of texture mods and runs at 60 FPS with only a few drops in FPS when the action gets busy or there is a lot of foliage around, runs Elite Dangerous Horizons maxed out as well, also used on a few smaller indie games like Fishing Planet and I can't even tell it's running.All in all this card should serve most normal 1080 HD PC gamers very well and in the last 10 years I've had zero issues with any EVGA cards I've used...very high quality. When I upgrade again in a few years (or up to a 1070) I will choose EVGA and Newegg!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Doing something wrong?,2016-10-05,Pros:Overall I guess it was a good buy. easy to setup and is still fast however...,Cons:I can't seem to run GTA 5 in atleast High settings at 60fps. Other games like the Division and Battlefront work perfectly and smooth so maybe it's just GTA is poorly optimized. I would've expected the 1060 to be able to run gta in ultra but it doesn't that way which is why i'm also unsure of how other youtube videos playing gta 5 in ultra are able to run it consistently. I'm even using Precision XOC and that still isn't helping either.,Other Thoughts:I was originally using an r9 380 but there doesn't seem to be a huge difference between the two cards. how long until this card becomes obsolete?
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Best ""Sweet spot"" card I've ever seen. Best current 1060 to buy.",2016-09-30,"Pros:As the title says, this is the best ""sweet spot"" card I've seen. The previous generation card in the ""sweet spot"" was the GTX 970, which came in at $400 and was actually a pretty good deal. This however blows that deal out of the water. This kind of performance (any game on the planet at 1080p, ultra graphics, at a constant 60fps) is simply unbelievable to me at this price pint, which is currently $259.Add to that the size of this card, which is probably 2/3 to half the size of many current cards. I LOVE this. Makes it so easy to use in almost any build.QUIET! I can barely hear this thing running (probably due to the single fan) while playing games.In a nutshell, this is the best performing card per dollar on the market. And this particular one (EVGA 6gb) is the best value among them.",Cons:None. Works perfectly out of the box at low temps and with super quiet operation.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid Card,2016-09-26,"Pros:Small, powerful, affordable, runs cool, overclocks well, good value and highly rated. I would recommend this to anyone who games at 1080p.",Cons:I might have a problem with low minimum framerates when overclocking as I noticed a trend where the higher I overclocked the higher the average fps would go but the minimum fps would actually lower. Could be a problem for some people but yet to be a problem for me playing The Witcher 3.,Other Thoughts:Using EVGA Precision X OC I got an overclock of +150MHz on the GPU and +500MHz on the memory. My Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 score is 1845 with an average framerate of 73.3 and runs at 70 degrees C after 20 minutes in Furmark. I haven't ran it overnight yet so we'll see if the overclock can survive an 8hr stress test.EDIT: turns out +150MHz is a little too much for The Witcher 3 to run stably but +90 works well.. At max settings with Hairworks I average in the low 50 fps with dips down to 40 at times but definitely still playable and enjoyable visually. Also using Precision X OC I had to increase the voltage bar on the left to 50% just fyi.One thing that bugged me was my custom Fan map didn't apply properly in Precision X OC so I had to run it in Aggressive mode instead. Not a huge deal and could just be me but it was something.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful.,2016-09-15,"Pros:I think I heard the card laugh, when I requested Skyrim maxed out.  It offered it up in 2K.  GTA V is maxed out at 1080p.  There may be frame rate dips, but I didn't notice.  I haven't officially measured anything.  I haven't overclocked or utilized the boost feature.  The card is a beast!",Cons:None.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Eveything is perfect except......,2016-09-13,Pros:-Small form factor for the same specs as a double fan graphics card.-easy to setup-Benchmark and stress test are incredible-Really great product overall,Cons:-Normally a graphics card will come with an adapter for the DVI and VGA. This card only come with the power adapter (For old power supply). So be aware !,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,No Man’s Sky? No Problems!,2016-09-13,Pros:-Price to Performance Ratio-Small Form Factor,Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from an EVGA GTX 970 SSC ACX 2.0. Although the 970 is more than capable of running most games (GTA5, Skyrim, ARMA 3, etc) at high settings with 40 to +60fps (1080p), I had to give in to the hype of the 1060. At the price point Newegg was offering the card, I had to get one for myself.After receiving the card, I installed it along with the 1060's driver and 10 series specific EVGA Precision OC software. I also installed the 0db Fan Stop BIOS (the factory BIOS will have the fan running at 45%, minimum). I ran it at factory clock on Unigine Extreme settings (3 times) and got an average score of 2133.In my ITX case (specs below), I was getting temps up to 82C on the card, max, on each of the run, with the base curve. After fiddling with a custom curve, I was able to have the fan operate at a tolerable noise level and keeping the temperature at under 75C.Gaming-wise, the temps run slightly lower than the benchmarking temps, between 60-70C, depending on the instance in the game. I can run GTA5 maxed out @ +60fps. On No Man's Sky, with this card an my other specs, I get +60fps on the highest settings at 1080p, at all instances with no crashes (as reported by many people). Every now and then I'd get a few dips in fps but it most likely the game and not the GPU. This card is No Man's Sky friendly!If you're looking to upgrade and on a tight budget, don't settle for anything in the 900 series. This card cost less and performs just as well as the highest 900 series. I highly recommend this card!Specs:Case: Thermaltake Core V1CPU: i5 6600KMobo: GIGABYTE GA-H170N-WIFIRAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 8GB (4Gx2)OS: Windows 10GPU: EVGA 1060 SC ACX 2.0 Single FanPSU: CX750MCPU Cooler: LEPA AquaChanger 120"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great 1080p card at a good price!,2016-09-10,"Pros:- Easy to install- Cooling is amazing, even with only 1 fan- Looks good (if this kind of thing matters to you)- Fits into almost any case, which is perfect for Micro ATX/Mini ITX builds- Requires only a single 6-pin for additional power- And most importantly, it performs like a beast! Coming from a GTX 950 is like night and day!- Bonus: I got some cool in-game stuff for Paragon, which is nice since I really enjoy the game :)","Cons:- Nothing really, other than I had to wait about a week to finally catch it in stock :)",Other Thoughts:Perfect budget card for 1080p (and maybe even 1440p) if you can find it at MSRP!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge Upgrade,2016-09-09,Pros:FastMore RAM than I will ever need,"Cons:The ports don't match up very well with the back of my case,  limiting me to using the DVI port at this time. That is more my problem than the card I guess.","Other Thoughts:I went from a Radeon 5670 (it died) to this and WOW talk about night and day.  With the 5670 the best I could do was Medium graphics settings.  Now with the 1060 I am running max settings on the games I play (iRacing and ETS2).  If you can't afford or don't want to spend $200-$400 more (like me) on a 1070 or 1080,  this is a great card for the money!CPU-FX-4300 OC'd @4.1 GHzCPU cooler- Corsair H70MB- ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0RAM- Corsair Vengeance 8GB DDR3 1866PSU- 550 Watt"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge upgrade from a GTX 760 at a ridiculously low price!,2016-09-07,Pros:Fits easily in mid sized case. Running new games on ultra quite easily. The single fan keeps temps well in cool range on heavy loads (Witcher 3 maxed including Hairworks) and is very quiet.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Love it,2016-09-07,"Pros:Quiet, small, powerful",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Perfect for my HTPC. Upscales 1080 and lower content to 4K with ease using pretty aggressive MadVR settings. Really fits the bill.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fantastic upgrade, great price/performance",2016-09-07,Pros:- Cheap and effective-Runs at 65 C max in my set up- almost 3x better than my r7 260x- Low power draw-Small,Cons:-Literally none. I have had no issues.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this to anyone in the 250-300 dollar price range that can't afford to move up to a 1070 or Fury X.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice card for 1080P,2016-09-07,Pros:6GB of ram.. enough to run 4k if you wantNice upgrade path for the priceCard runs cool and quiet,Cons:Would have been nice for 2 fans. But 1 seems to do the job okLack of SLI in the 1060,"Other Thoughts:I run the Witcher 3 and some other AAA titles with max detail at 1080p with this card at a very good frame rate.Nice upgrade for me coming from an EVGA GTX 670card runs at 35c puttering around in windows, and 65c while gaming with the fan at 70%"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Love the card!,2016-09-07,"Pros:This was a major upgrade from my old 750 card. All games are running smoothly (FHD). With the new firmware the card is silent when non intensive GPU work is done. I have a small case, but the temperature of the card never exceeded 78 C. The fan was not too noisy either.",Cons:Nothing really.,"Other Thoughts:Great card, small, quiet. I like the fact that there are no LEDs on it."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best Bang For The Buck Hands Down,2016-09-07,"Pros:Size, Size, Size, did I say size? This little GTX1060sc is exceptional for the size, totally outscores my GTX970 in every benchmark I put it through. It's an EVGA... Who else could pull this off? dollar for dollar the best graphics card for the money there is. If you can get your hands on this I definitely would recommend you stop looking and buy this one.","Cons:I can't find one, when you do let me know.","Other Thoughts:Totally Recommend, Yes I would buy it again and yes I would recommend it to a friend."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card for the money period!,2016-09-07,"Pros:Clearly if you are looking at this card, or in fact reading anyones reviews, you already know this card is awesome and its what you are looking for.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card for the money,2016-09-07,Pros:-This card is less expensive than almost every 1060 but performs just as well if not better-Runs cool-Lower power usage-Zero Fanspeed mode-Quiet-Only $10 more than nonSC version (better heatsink)-Max out any game at 1080p-Good warranty,Cons:Need to get a 1070 to max out some titles at 1440p,Other Thoughts:I believe this is the best 1060 value you can get and most certainly the best card for around $250
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,BEST GPU for 1080p 144hz gaming,2016-09-05,"Pros:-35C idle temperature (I have 6 fans in my case: 2 front, 2 top, 2 back)-45C load temperature (pretty good)-I get 130fps in GTA 5 on maxed out settings (85 fps if I put distance to max in advance settings)-I get 95+fps in Battlefield 1 Beta on ultra settings-Affordable card, I bought it for $256.78 (including tax)",Cons:-None at the moment (I have been using this card for more than a month now),"Other Thoughts:This is better than the GTX 1070 because if you look at benchmarks, the 1070 will have around 20fps more than the 1060. $200 more for 20fps more is not worth it in my opinion. Stick with this card to save money and have good results."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice,2016-09-05,"Pros:Everything I need for gaming @ 1080, mighty quiet unless pushed to the limit, small form-factor, sips power like a lady, looks mighty good in a small case build.","Cons:Sad that it cannot be SLI`ed, but oh well.","Other Thoughts:If I could justify the price of a 1070 for the amount of gaming I do, or the resolution I use (1080) then I would have bought one. But for me this works just fine, out benchmarks the 970, and should be all I need for a while. The 6 GB RAM is excellent as well, and should serve me for a long time.For anyone doing an mATX/miniITX build that wants the most performance in the smallest size, you do not need to look any further. The only way to beat this is by water cooling a higher priced card, so if you are debating the cost or size just stop now and hit the Ad to Cart button. Unless you are waiting for it to be back in stock, then keep waiting, it`s worth every penny."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,2.0GHz Right Out of the Box! And for only $260! WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!?!,2016-09-02,Pros:- This card went right to 1960MHz when I got it up and running and peaked under load (naturally) at 2000MHz- Full load I can barely hear the fan over the case fans that I have- At Full load it usually is about 60-65 C (I have never seen this card achieve a temp over 65 C. EVER!),"Cons:Not really cons, but:- No backplate (Would be cool, but unnecessary due to the small size)- No LEDs (Again, totally unnecessary. But a light up EVGA logo like the 1070's would be pretty sweet)","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card. I can play all games maxed out at 60+ fps (Except for the cpu intensive ones due to a cpu bottleneck). Unless you want to try to OC this to its absolute max, your temps should stay below 70 C (even under load). Due to my cpu bottleneck, I have not had the opportunity to give this card a run for the money, but all things considered, BEST VALUE CARD!!! (Purchased it when it was $260) First time buying EVGA and I think I might stick with them from now on! Great product quality and a 3 year warranty."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great CUDA card for Premiere Pro,2016-09-01,Pros:Wonderful GPU acceleration for Adobe Premiere Pro video editing.  Great Bang-For=Buck performance and easy Memory Overclocking,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:So satisfied I just bought a second one   In testing with Premiere Pro BenchMark it is just as fast as my GTX 780Ti for GPU acceleration.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Performs without issue.,2016-08-22,"Pros:Easy installation, smaller physical size, single quiet fan even under load.  The GTX 1060 performs very well for its price.","Cons:None.  6GB RAM is overkill for 1080p/1200p resolution but I'll probably get a 2560x1080 monitor soon and it will help with that, I suppose.","Other Thoughts:One of the other reviews for this product complains of high temperatures due to it having only one fan.  That has not been my experience.  This GPU plays DOOM at 1920x1200 resolution on Ultra at > 60fps without issue.  After an hour of game play, the card remains quiet with a temperature of  40C over ambient.  In my 22C/72F office, that's 62C/144F.  Those temperatures are well within tolerable limits."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,"Excellent performance, but why are my temperatures so high at full load?",2016-08-22,"Pros:Great graphics and framerate, yatta yatta... you've heard it all before -- it's as good as everyone has suggested. I upgraded from a GTX 760 and this is certainly a satisfactory upgrade. I played Dragon Age 3 for the first time comfortably with everything ULTRA /w fade-touched textures and 2x MSAA WITH VSync and things went great at a stable 50-60FPS. Dips down to the mid-40's with really intense scenes but extremely rare. I was very satisfied with the performance. Anyone who's played DA3 knows the environments are MASSIVE so to see it breeze through such scenes was exciting.","Cons:However...The single-fan design didn't seem to do as much for temps as others claimed it did. I'm not sure if it's a quality control issue like some have suggested, or that this is actually normal and some of these buyers were testing in arctic environments, but when at full load on Dragon Age 3, I was getting upwards of 87 Celsius, sometimes hitting 89 C after just a couple minutes. Bear in mind this was with a MAXIMUM efficiency airflow setup in a NZXT S340 case.Strangely, there were no adverse graphical effects, which leaves me no doubt that the card can handle the temperatures, but I simply didn't feel comfortable gaming for hours with it.  The temperatures scared me, so I turned VSync on for the framerate limit, which again, stays roughly around 60FPS. That way the GPU rarely goes to 100% utilization and temps stay around 60-70 C which is still a bit high, but not as insane as what I was witnessing before I did this. I also removed the front panel of the S340 so the fans could deal with the heat better as I could literally feel the OUTSIDE of my case become hot at those temperatures, which is kinda nuts.I absolutely did not feel comfortable leaving it at full load at those temperatures for hours.**COOLING CONFIG**NZXT S340 CASE:- 2x Corsair AF140's PULLING air at the FRONT- 1x Corsair SP140 PUSHING air out at the TOP- 1x Corsair AF120 PUSHING air out at the BACKAMBIENT AIR: ~80 F (Summer in NYC)OTHER POTENTIALLY RELEVANT FACTORS: Asus 970 Aura Motherboard, AMD FX8350, Super neat cable management and dust-free and impediment-free airflow (wish I could provide pictures -- grr Newegg).---NOTE: My CPU temperatures with this fan setup have been FANTASTIC, yet somehow this GPU's temps are reaching nearly 90C at full load... HOW??","Other Thoughts:If I could do it again, I probably would have spent a little extra money on a card with better fan/heatsink design. I might actually return this if I can manage to grab the Zotac design at a decent price. I had to remove the front panel on my case to deal with all the additional heat...ugly.I dunno, maybe I got a dud, I don't want to bag on EVGA, but it's my first time going with them (always been a fan of Gigabyte and Windforce) and I'm a little disappointed. I suppose it's not all bad considering it's not actually negatively affecting anything graphically as of yet, but these temps can't be safe."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,The best deal Nvidia has offered all year,2016-08-19,"Pros:- Amazing refresh rates- Excellent price point (paid $260)- This card should fit most PC cases (excluding micro cases)- Super easy to install with PCI-e power cable included- Huge improvement over my 970Ti- Super quite fan, even in an aluminum case",Cons:-Does not support SLI but comes with instructions on how to install up to 4 in SLI mode.   Cruel...very cruel.Does not include any drivers for offline installation.  Even though they would be out of date basic drivers should be included since Nvidia driver pack is currently over 450mb download.  For offline users or worse (DSL users) this is a non-starter.,Other Thoughts:Since I was upgrading from an Nvidia 960Ti card I simply updated the drivers and then shutdown and did a card swap.  Super easy.  Within 15 minutes I easily doubled my FPS.If you are a gamer looking to upgrade this card is worth serious consideration.  If you are running your PC on your large LED screen at 1080p like me then the 1070 and 1080 models are overkill.I'm so impressed with this card I am already shopping for a new gaming laptop with the integrated 1060 chip.This is my third EVGA made card.  All cards have been excellent.  Overclocking tools and monitoring software is first rate.  Manufacturing build quality is excellent.  Even under heavy load never had a heat spike.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Perfect for my needs,2016-08-18,Pros:- Fast- Great value- Zero RPM fan mode,Cons:- Need to download BIOS update,"Other Thoughts:I'm a teacher, and I installed this in my older Dell Optiplex 790 minitower in my classroom. The motherboard only supplies 35W through the PCI Express slot so I was worried that even with an upgraded power supply it would not work. I replaced the stock power supply with an EVGA 600 B1 to provide the needed 6-pin power connector for the card. Once installed, it started right up without any problems.I downloaded the new Zero RPM BIOS and now the card is silent when running less stressful tasks. Even when I start Garry's Mod, Minecraft, or Autodesk Inventor the card is never loud. I'm very happy to give new life to my older computer."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, quiet, easy setup",2016-08-16,"Pros:Runs Doom and Dying Light on maximum setting at 1080p with no issues.  I've seen it run as hot as 70C, but it's never loud.Ppl complain about no backplates on certain models like this one.  Graphics card looks don't matter much to me, but for what it's worth, It's the nicest looking card I've ever owned.The 9cm fan is a larger/quieter than the 8cm fans on my old card.",Cons:One fan instead of two may impede OC.  I haven't bothered overclocking this yet because there would be no noticeable performance change.,"Other Thoughts:I would have been happy with a 4GB RX 480 at $200, but I found this in stock first.  It is a little bit better product than an RX 480 4GB and 8GB and it's a little more expensive.  If you're thinking of spending around $250, I'd recommend this over the RX 480."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2016-08-16,"Pros:- It's small, gives more airflow in my mid tower.- It boosted to 2000, and I took it bit further to 2100-2200 with precision software.- Never goes above 65 in temp.- Ran all UHD benchmarks at 60 FPS or better","Cons:-Nothing, it took me a while to catch it in stock.",Other Thoughts:I'd recommend this to anyone gaming at 1080p.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"yeah, this is the 1080p card to have",2016-08-12,"Pros:Cost, power efficiency, small size, quiet, cool, 1080p >60fps ultra everything. literally twice the average fps of my evga 770.fast sync is also fantastic for quicker high framerate games.",Cons:no backplate? idk it has no cons XD,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Excellent, small size, high performance GPU",2016-08-11,"Pros:Size: Perfect for my new mITX build. Had a GTX 980 In there, had to cut the case and squeeze that sucker in. The 1060 sc, however, is so small installation was a breeze, with tons of room to spare.Power: Low power consumption compared to my GTX 980 for comparable performance output.Noise: hardly audible during gameplay, unless you're making it your job to listen for it. Impressive regardless, especially for a single fan unit that cools as well as a dual fan unit.Cooling: Low steady temps. This thing runs at 61 degrees Celsius for the entirety of my gaming sessions on ultra graphics at 1440p.  It is excellent, especially given it's small size and single fan.","Cons:Looks: Has the same look as older gen EVGA GPU's in the ""mini sc"" model line, such as the GTX 750 sc. Not so much a con, as it looks pretty nice, but if we are nit picking for the sake of it, the lack of style upgrade from previous gen model is basically the only thing I could come up with.No SLI: Not so much a con of this specific card, but more of the new gen GPU line from NVIDIA. As an enthusiast I love SLI'ing cards and other unnecessary PC mods, and I'm a little bummed out I'll never be able to do it with new gen GPU's.","Other Thoughts:If you need a card that will perform excellently on demanding games on high graphics and at high resolution  and in a small form factor to fit into tight spaces do not hesitate for even a moment. This bad boy sells out FAST. Don't settle for a similar mini, like the one from ZOTAC, as for essentially the same price this model is superclocked and higher clock speeds."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,AMAZING CARD!,2016-08-10,"Pros:This EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING is a great card for the price!Powerful, small and quiet.Very happy with this purchase.I was worried mine will come with a coil whine or noisy fan like others have experienced. But no, very silent card.",Cons:Nothing really for the price,"Other Thoughts:When I first plugged it in my PC wouldn't post, just froze up. To get around that, i needed to reset my bios with clear cmos button, and all worked after that. Also the EVGA PercisionX OC software is very useful, give you much control over the card. You can tune the fan speed down or up. I have mine set to 0dB up to 40 degrees C."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great purchase!,2016-08-10,"Pros:- The size of this thing is great, very compact. Huge reduction in size switching from an r9 390x.- Powerful, this card is really great and around the same performance of the 390x I had, but even better in some games. Fps also seems a lot more consistent and I am not having any huge dips as I did with my other card. I am getting amazing performance in all games very high to ultra/max settings in 1440p.- I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about on the other listing for the non SC, this thing runs very cool. It has never gotten past the 60s on full load and some games I'm not even breaking 50 C. This card runs super cool especially with a single cooling fan. And I'm switching from an AMD card, my case actually blows out cold air now :)","Cons:- Wish it had SLI support, but that would be overkill and would probly outperform 1070s maybe a 1080 for cheaper?","Other Thoughts:- This is a great card especially for the price, I would def recommend it.- The performance, size, and low temperature of this card is amazing for the price point."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"Great card, really annoying fan.",2016-08-10,"Pros:Runs Witcher 3 close to max settings (foliage ""High"" and Hairworks ""Off"") at 1080p with near constant 60fps. Should set one for 1080p gaming for years to come!","Cons:The fan ""clicks"" and is audible during more silent parts of gameplay. Completely unexpected of a new product and obtrusive enough to warrant the low rating. Also does not run as cool as expected, but at least has yet to peak over 85C at 50% fan.","Other Thoughts:Review updated to reflect impressions after the card has been put through its paces. Simply put, the EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC is a beast of a card marred by the lottery pick of a lemon fan."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing!,2016-08-09,Pros:- Fits perfectly on my mAtx case- Is always silent even while heavy gaming- Delivers pure 1080p on maxed settings on every game I throw at it- The compact design is a plus- Easy to install,Cons:- None so far,"Other Thoughts:When it comes to Evga products, you can't go wrong because of their power usage and sleek design. Overall, I am very satisfied with this card since I will be mainly be gaming on 1080p due to my monitor. I would definitely recommend this card!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great so far,2016-08-09,"Pros:Installed without a hitch.  Performance, size, power consumption all miles better than the failing 5870 it replaced.  Should handle whatever I throw at it 1080p good settings for the foreseeable future.",Cons:None yet.,None

BF4 is ALL ULTRA and average like 115 frames. it's so great-fan is quiet-new bios has feature to custom fan curve 0% speed fans on idle (AMD cpu can't flash new bios yet)worked right out of the box-OC is so easy, +140/+250, still quiet, still cool, still <70 degrees celcius","Cons:nothing really, maybe had a cool led","Other Thoughts:has no leds on the gpu that is why its one of the cheaper cardsdon't think 1 fan can't cool this card, it cools extremely well and quiet"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Extremely happy,2016-08-07,Pros:QualityFastEfficientNot as expensive as other 1060sQuietNo coil whine,Cons:Only one fan? But still stays pretty cool so two fans may be overkill,Other Thoughts:Had the gigabyte g1 gaming 1060 and suffered from excessive coil whine and a loud fan. The evga has been perfect since day 1.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,The Best 1080P Graphics Card,2016-08-06,Pros:I have absolutely no doubt concerning the reliability and performance of any graphics card from the EVGA brand. I also liked how it came with a free poster. I love free stuff.,"Cons:Do not buy this card for 1440P or 4K Monitors. I recommend the GTX 1070 or GTX 1080. I personally expect to be using this card for the next 2 years. During that time hopefully 4K monitors, Virtual Reality, and processing power of graphics cards card will be a little more mature and affordable for mainstream use.",None

I've dealt with them numerous times for the various cards I've owned, and they've been great every time."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best GPU I ever owned! Exceeded all my standards.,2016-08-04,"Pros:-Fan is super quiet.-The gpu boost is amazing, boosts to over 2000mhz at times, and temp doesn't go over 70C-Compared this card to my friend's RX 480, this card kills it at all DX11 Benchmarks, we both have win7, no dx12.-Very cheap for the performance, got the card in 2 days.",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:If there would be an SLI option for GTX 1060, I would most likely go for SLI. But I guess put together both cards in SLI, they maybe would outperform a GTX 1080."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, quiet, reasonably affordable",2016-08-04,"Pros:Physically short, fast, cool, quiet, efficient. Great value compared to last generation.",Cons:4gb 480 may be a little better value.,"Other Thoughts:Seems to be about 75% faster than the 960 it  replaced @1440p, allowing for max detail in Grim Dawn and not dropping below 40 fps. At factory speeds, boost runs just under 2000 MHz for me. Temperature is very good. Even after playing for extended period, temp peaks around 61C and remains very quiet. I gave it another little bump on clock speeds (60 MHz core, 800 MHz memory) and ran Unigine Valley for a while and it topped out at 68C.  For those concerned about its single fan cooling, don't be. Every site that has reviewed this card comments on how surprisingly cool it stays with a single fan. It is also (obviously) very short. If you can fit a dual slot card, this thing will fit lengthwise. I have not flashed the new BIOS for the passive cooling at low load (perhaps only idle) but it is available. This card at time of purchase did not ship with this feature.I prefer NVidia and EVGA in particular to AMD offerings. With that being said, reviews seem to bounce all over the place with the 1060s versus the 480s. Most have the 1060 ahead a little up to a more comfortable lead. Some sites have them virtually tied in performance, while none that I have read show the 480 with any meaningful lead (overall). The 4gb 480 seems to be the value leader @199 and the 8gb seems to be a tossup with the 1060 based on its slightly lower price point but also slightly lower performance (again overall). Efficiency of Pascal is well documented as being tremendously better than Polaris (AMD). If this is important to you or your psu is questionable, the 1060 really is the only consideration. I personally am very happy (excited) about the purchase and use of this card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,quiet little card,2016-08-03,"Pros:This thing wipes the floor with my aging Radeon 6950, using much less power. 1080p gaming at max settings is a cakewalk just as advertised, and some less GPU-heavy games like Guild Wars 2 are easily playable at 1440p and 2160p.The easy BIOS update from the EVGA forums lets me spin the fan at 0 RPM. It's idling at 40c and 0 RPM in a room with no air conditioning right now. In furmark 1080p the temperature is 71c at 64% fan speed and still very quiet. Rest assured the single fan is enough to efficiently cool a GTX 1060, and splurging on a more expensive GTX 1060 with two or three fans is probably unnecessary.","Cons:I'm not a big fan of EVGA's PrecisionX OC software. EVGA wants you to sign up with personal details and give the card's serial code before installation, and MSI Afterburner is still more to my liking.","Other Thoughts:The plastic shroud on the left side of the card is too close to the clips in my old case, preventing them from snapping down to secure the card. Keep in mind my case is from 2009, and I'm also being lazy since I can rely on a thumb screw instead of the clips. I'll update when I receive a new case in the coming weeks, but I doubt this is going to affect anyone else.Update: It's a perfect fit in my Fractal Design Define Nano S. There's about 1 cm clearance between my ATX PSU and the card, but this does not seem to have had an effect on temps due to the good ventilation.Can't comment on overclocking potential just yet, as I currently have no use for it.The cable that came with mine is a 2 molex to 1 PCI 6 pin, not the one pictured by Newegg. This also doesn't affect me."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2016-08-03,"Pros:Noticeably faster than my R9 280x.  My son needed something better than the ancient HD4870 he was using and I couldn't bring myself to pay for an ""older-but-better"" card that would still work with BIOS for him.  I passed my 280x to him and grabbed this.  I had wondered if I would need to upgrade my 2.5 year old AMD FX setup in the next year, but I can say that I have no reason to do so at this point.  I run vsync because I can't stand even the slightest tearing so I'm really only judging by my system's ability to sustain 60fps@1080.  Doom, Just Cause 3, Final Fantasy 14, and a few others - all max settings and buttery where I had to turn a few things down before with my 280x (or live with some lower frame rates.)  There is one game I tried (still in alpha and under NDA so I can't specify) that I had to turn the shadows down one step from max.I have no beef with AMD and my choice of this over a 480 came to availability.  I am seeing some benches that put this a little ahead of the 480 but the pricing seems to reflect that appropriately.This is a fantastic card for the MSRP.  Don't pay gouged prices.  Wait for the stock to level out if you need to.  Unless you're doing >1080 or are serious about VR, this is the new sweet spot.",Cons:Had to replace all my mini-displayport dongles with regular displayport for my extra monitors.

Chose GTX 1060 because of the low energy and heat when sitting so many in a case side by side.  They also look outstanding with my black and silver theme.  In a lot of images the highlights look white, but they are mirrored silver.  The small form also looks great with my design because it allows some of the accents of the motherboard to shine when they would otherwise be covered.  I laugh every time I see giant and expensive versions of this GPU will full length heat sinks.  Those solutions are so far overkill,  The only goal they hit is to drain your wallet..

I have a 4K TV and this card connects via HDMI 4K@60Hz no problem. Can do 60fps+ at 1080p/1440p easily, some older games like Dirty 3 even run at 4K 60fps with everything maxed out. It works very well also with a more CPU intensive app like FSX/P3D, in big metro area like KLAX the CPU (i7-6700k) is now the bottleneck and having a more powerful GPU would not help much in this case.Runs super quiet, with bios update from EVGA the fan would turn off at idle which makes it perfect for HTPC usage.","Cons:No SLI support, dx12 performance still to be determined in future games.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing card for the price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Insanely cheap card that runs better the gtx 980. Out of the box it was over clocked to 2000 mhz, after using EVGA's over clock tools on their webpage I was able to run a stable system at 2101 mhz with a memory bus of 2302 mhz. This overclocking made my computer literally 500% better when compared to my old gtx 745 4GB in the 3D marks firestrike and timespy benchmarks . It is able to handle 1080p with 60 frames a second when the settings are maxed on every game I own, some examples are Total War: Warhammer and Sniper Elite 3. The install was easy and Nvidia's GeForce Experience quickly and easily installed the drivers for the card. Altogether it took me about ten minutes to be up and running. I have not had any issues with overheating, the hottest I have had it run is 65 Celsius but that was while it was overclocked with the standard fan speed.  Normal my temperature sits somewhere around 55 Celsius when I am just playing games.","Cons:The only possible issue there could be is that it only has a 6 GB cache, right now that's more than enough but it doesn't future proof it as much as I would like.","Other Thoughts:Completely worth it, incredible price to power ratio."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great Card, Great Performance",2016-08-01,"Pros:the EVGA Geforce GTX 1060 SC Gaming is as good as advertised. It is automatically overclocked, and able to be OC'd further with Precision X. What's more is it functions really well. In my system it replaced a GTX 760, and is more than twice as fast. It runs reasonably quiet, and is so efficient while taking up a small footprint.",Cons:No downside that I've experienced. It is an excellent card for a good price,"Other Thoughts:I've only used it on DX11 titles, not interested in any DX12 currently, but have experienced close to 1080p 60fps throughout without overclocking. The exception to that rule is the Wither 3, which sits at about 52-55 without oc, with oc it is a flat 60 with everything on max but hairworks"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Awesome Card for a Great Price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Impress Card with impress performance. Runs great and quite even with a Single fan. Max temp i have seen under a full load for over a full hour has been 65C. This is with a normal fan curve since 0db fan mode makes me nervous but that's just me. Doesn't bottleneck my 3570k @ 4.0ghz. The newest games I've used with this game are Doom, Mirror's Edge, BO3, Unreal Tournament Alpha, Killing Floor 2, and a few others. All games run 60+ fps with no issues.","Cons:I haven't found any yet. After a week of usages, I'm pretty happy","Other Thoughts:EVGA is always a stand up brand. I replaced a EVGA SC 770 4gb card with this. The 770 was given to me from a friend and is now in my wife's computer. Before she got that, she was still running my old Evga 570 Blower card. The thing still runs great to this day after countless hours and years of gaming on it. And now it's going to find a new home in the minecraft pc I am building for my nephew who is 5 years old. Thank you again for a fantastic product. Hopefully I will be upgrading my mobo and cpu in a few years, and I really hope to switch my mobo to EVGA as well. Thanks again!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little card,2016-08-01,"Pros:Quite, in nearly  inaudible over my  other system fansruns cool with my aggressive fan-curvemanaged to get my sample to boost up to 2200Mhz core and  4600 on the ram",Cons:evga released a bios update that nerfs the fan profile which pushes temps into the 75c rangethe fan is virtually silent at 100% (unless you live in a libary) so this is pretty pointlessstill its a easy fix with msi afterburner or evga precision 's custom fan profile,Other Thoughts:a little monster of a card  I can't manage to choke itIt just grits its teeth takes up a tae kwon do pose and kicks snot out of everything I throw at ithere is my 3d markrun  3dm/13775269
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,What's not to like,2016-08-01,"Pros:Tiny, cool, efficient, plays Overwatch on epic and maintains 70 FPS no problem.",Cons:No SLI,"Other Thoughts:FYI, they did release a firmware update for the card to allow for 0 RPM fan mode when the card is sitting idle. The link to the download is in the EVGA forums. Happy Gaming!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Dream card.,2016-07-31,Pros:+ small card. makes working on PC easier.+ quiet. no coil whine.,Cons:-login required for evga precision software,Other Thoughts:Upgraded from 7950's Crossfired. This card trumps those cards and at much less power and heat. Been revisiting all my old games turning them to ultra. Vermintide runs 'ok' on ultra but that is a poorly optimized game and still surprised it runs as good as it does.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing  performance for the price.,2016-07-30,Pros:- Amazing performance- Amazing price- Quiet fan- nice stock overclock,Cons:I honestly can't cay anything bad about this card. the performance is outstanding for the price.,"Other Thoughts:- This is a huge upgrade coming from my gtx 760 sc.- I was worried about getting a single fan, but there is no big difference at all."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,It's good...but could be better with a some kind of GDDR5 heatsink solution.,2016-07-30,Pros:1) Well built2) Came with port plugs3)  Quite4) No coil whine (at least on mine),"Cons:1) No heatsink and not even a thermal pad on GDDR5 chips? On no you didn't EVGA! Memory chips should be cooled! They reach temperature of greater than 90 degrees, look here: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060-pascal,4679-8.html So I am disappointed about that.2) Where the hell do I find the BIOS update for this thing on your website? I see the driver, but the bios? Simple things like these should not be ""searched for"", make it happen - with a click!3) Cut on useless paper & posters in the box...help save the trees.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Simply Amazing,2016-07-28,"Pros:Unbelievably quiet. The new BIOS allows 0 RPM operation but even when benchmarking on high or ultra settings it cannot be heard over CPU and case fans (which are running at low RPM settings. The performance is amazing, Without OCing it exceeded the boost speed. Never exceeded 65 Celsius. It is so small it really needs no backplate. I was worried but unless you plan to really overclock this I see no need, With Precision X I don't see why you can't get the base clock close to 2000Mhz. I play everything at 2560X1440 very smoothly (now if it would aim for me).","Cons:Could it be free? Seriously at $249 after rebate it is the best performance for the money I have ever seen in a gaming card. Combined with the low temps, quiet fan, and low power use, it is amazing.It was a little weird to have no drivers or utilities or a CD at all included and very minimal instructions. The plug and play experience was good but it replaced a NVidia card. I guess EVGA figures everyone has a nice internet connection and knows what they are doing.","Other Thoughts:I have to say the weirdest part is pulling my old but still nice EVGA GTX960 SSC out and replacing it with a card half the size that performs SOOO much better.  If you are upgrading any card at that level or below you will be very happy. Don't forget to flash the BIOS, it is painless."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card for the price ever released,2016-07-28,Pros:Runs extremely silent and cool and handles 3 1440p monitors no problem,Cons:Wish it had SLI,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2016-07-27,"Pros:Small, quiet and sips power. Punches above its weight in performance, maxing out most games at 1080p/60. My particular card is a capable overclocker, running at +110 core +520 mem. Build quality seems excellent, and XOC is easy use (Afterburner, etc, also work). EVGA warranty and support are a bonus.",Cons:-No SLI-Fan runs at idle (will be fixed in an update),None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Incredible value and performance,2016-07-27,Pros:- Small- Powerful,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from an EVGA gtx 660 to this EVGA gtx 1060 SC.  The performance increase is incredible, and the price can't be beat.  When they say this card delivers more than the gtx 980, they were not kidding.  Install was a breeze, I just swapped the cards out and let the NVidia control panel install the latest driver (custom install > clean install) and away I went.  About 15 minutes total time to upgrade and start gaming.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who cannot spend $500 to buy the 1070 or 1080, and would purchase myself again in a heartbeat."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very Nice!,2016-07-26,"Pros:Being only 7"" long it fit easily into my HTPC with an mATX board and has more than enough power to run the latest releases on max settings.  It was a big improvement coming from my old GTX 460. Runs quite and cool.",Cons:Have not found one yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, Efficient, Cool running GPU that packs a lot of value for the money",2016-07-25,"Pros:Back Ordered this card on Tuesday's launch. It shipped on Thursday and arrived on Saturday, 3 days ahead of schedule. Once installed I fired up gpu-z to see how it was doing in idle and gaming states.One note, my AC just went out so the ambient air temp here is 95 degrees F, 35 degrees C. At the desktop, nothing else running, idle temp is 40 C. After gaming for an hour or so the temperature went to a max 61 C. For a delta of 5 C and 26 C for idle and gaming respectively on this 1060. On my old card, an HD 7850, the delta was 10 C and 30 C respectively.Boost 3.0 would allow for a stable 1950 Mhz clock while gaming in stock condition. It would idle at 253 Mhz. The fps of the 1060 was a bit more than 3x that of the HD 7850.I used a kill o watt meter to measure total system power draw with old card (HD 7850) and this one. With the HD 7850, the computer was drawing 48 watts at idle and 148 watts while playing Diablo 3. The GTX 1060 SC meausred 38 watts at idle and 88 watts while playing Diablo 3. The power draw for the 1060 while playing Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4 was 180 watts and 130 watts respectively. So this card will vary its power use depending on the games you play.My games play very smooth using this card and the card consumes a bare minimum of power and runs at very low temperatures while doing so. I think the EVGA GTX 1060 SC represents a terrific value for the money and should provide enjoyable gaming for years to come.",Cons:None that I can think of.,Other Thoughts:My Computer's specs are as follows:I7 6700K 4.0 GhzCryorig H7 UniversalGigabyte Z170 Gaming 716 GB GSKill TridentZ DDR4 3400 Mhz500 GB Samsung Evo 850 SSD Boot/Gaming480 GB OCZ 150 trion SSDCorsair HX 750WEVGA GTX 1060 SCFractal Design Define SWindow 10 Pro

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great Performance but the fan stop working,2018-12-17,Pros:- Great for last games in 1080p- Quiet,"Cons:After 1 year, the fan break.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Fits in my MicroATX build,2018-12-16,Pros:Short. You get good value with all the heat pipes. Overclocked. The fan is off until it needs it. Faster than I need.,Cons:The manual is poor. It's generic and for many different models. Included poster isn't as cool as I would expect. Bundled game cannot be resold and is Windows only. Playing the game requires creating accounts on NVidia and Steam.The card is as tall as the spec. allows and the 6-pin power connector comes out the top.,Other Thoughts:Tom's Hardware describes a modification you can make to the heat sink.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,Couldnt get to work,2018-11-29,Pros:Looks nice and is small,"Cons:Could not get it to work in windows 10. Windows was very unstable and would crash everytime about 10 minutes after boot. Tried reinstalling windows still wouldnt work. Tried to download drivers but could not because windows would crash. Couldnt find a fix so I threw it in the trash.  Put back in my old card, system works great.","Other Thoughts:I dont know, it would not work, didnt seem damaged. But i just cant deal with this many problems. A gpu today should be plug and play, or at least tell you what is the problem."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card with only one real annoyance,2018-11-23,"Pros:Excellent performance, paired with a great price.","Cons:Having only one hdmi port and three display ports is a bit bizarre to me, and unfortunately I am going to need a secondary hdmi port, so I'll need to buy a converter. Again, just kind of an annoyance, but the rationale kind of racks my brain.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great performance for price, very quiet",2018-11-20,"Pros:- Very quiet, fan doesn't even turn on below around 58 C, and I haven't seen the temp go above 70 C yet.- Easy to install, small enough for many PCs if upgrading- Better performance than I expected. Good FPS in Cities Skylines on near-max settings (uses 4-5 GB of the GPU RAM).- Requires only a moderate power supply (it says 400 W minimum in manual)",Cons:- None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product for the price.,2018-11-18,Pros:-Fast-Small-Relatively quiet-Only requires a single 6-pin PCIe power-Has the firmware that doesn't shut down the fan-About 10-15% faster than the EVGA 970 SSC,"Cons:-I payed MSRP.-It won't make me a cup of coffee in the morning nor give me a hug when I'm feeling blue.-I think it's dying...every now and then, (no real rhyme or reason) the screen will fill up with a pattern of faint white dots and streaks.  This may last for a few seconds up to several minutes, then everything will be fine again.Edit:  It was the monitor that was dying.","Other Thoughts:I bought this to replace my EVGA 970 SSC which went to my little sister. I wanted something that was a little more power efficient and had a little more oomph. It certainly met up with my expectations, aside from the minor nagging problems with the patterning on the screen. Power consumption in gaming with my core i7 4790K rarely exceeds 200W at the wall."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Good card, but slightly noisy fan",2018-10-22,"Pros:Easy to set up - plugged it in, turned PC on, ran NVidia graphics driver updater, done.Small - looks like it would fit in just about any PC (but check with the manufacturer before cramming it in a mITX case)Powerful - this card has more than enough power to play anything I want (though I only have a 60Hz 1080p screen). I'm glad I went with the 6GB version over the 3, since it's not much more expensive.","Cons:I think this is typically of all single-fan powerful cards, but you can almost always hear that fan going, especially under load. It's not like, really loud, but you can definitely hear it over any of the other noises in your computer. If you've got the dough, I'd get a double-fan version. But if you're on a budget and/or you don't mind a little fan noise, it's not too bad.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Buy this card from Newegg,2018-10-04,"Pros:- Small factor- Fans do not go over 1300rmp under load and are silent- 22 C idle; low 60's when playing games- Evga has great customer support, which alone is worth it","Cons:- Got this card locally cause I couldn't wait for delivery.. big mistake. Card was running 45C idle, and 80C under load. Fan was going 2800 rpm and sounding like a leaf blower. I couldn't play games even with my open ear headphones on.","Other Thoughts:Local retailer CanadaComputers didn't want to replace the card under 14 day replacement warranty, they said it is final sale (contrary to what is stated on the product page). Did RMA with EVGA 2 days later I got a new card that is running great.Kinda wish that I got the proper card the first time around, but still cannot take an egg off."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful but NOISEY,2018-09-04,Pros:Far exceeds my expectations. Runs everything I've thrown at it with Ultra/Extreme settings.,"Cons:LOUD when running bigger games. Seriously.. You might think a miniature jet is taking off from your computer. Not enough to take a star off, but something to keep in mind if you want a silent rig.","Other Thoughts:From all the research I've done, this card is the very best price to performance value at the moment.EDIT: After close to a year of use, this thing is still going strong and performing so much better than I ever expected."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It does what it does and does it well,2018-08-21,"Pros:Out of the box, it posts decent temps and isn't a power hog. Farcy 5 on all ultra settings w/a few modifications to bump up frame rates; ditto for Battlefront 2 and the Wolfenstein titles. It benchmarks decent FPS numbers in 1080p settings. I got this a entry/mid level build for my rig since I'm still pretty new at PC building, so this gave me what I desired at the time. I wasn't expecting blazing 4K gaming or was going to demand 3D rendering that a 1080 Ti would do without breaking a sweat.  I've been learning as I go with overclocking and this thing sure has taken a beating and hasn't quit yet.","Cons:There are some comments, but nothing that would make me take an egg/star away.  Tends to get a bit warm (75-77c) when overclocked, but that could also just have been the small form factor and just normal for a single fan card. I also didn't play with the fan curve. I kind of was hoping the ""EVGA GEFORCE..."" lettering on the side was LED, but it's not. Not many people like that, but I do. No backplate for bling or heat dissipation. XOC desn't allow for much tweaking with this model GPU, which I guess is understandable for an entry/mid level card.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to someone. Just don't expect it to give you gtx 1080 FPS or get blown away with 4K graphics. Only two things I'd change would be to give it a backplate and that cool LED light for the lettering on the side. Other than that, it's a solid buy."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,RMA'd twice,2018-08-09,Pros:- Runs well for 1060- Lowish heat output,"Cons:- My first card (brand new) broke after 4 months of use, it fans stopped spinning and black screen on post.- My 2nd card (refurbed one they sent me via RMA) broke after 1 year, DVI port stopped working and eventually card stopped output","Other Thoughts:I'm not sure, when this card works, it works very well for the price point, but I've gone through TWO of them in 2 years and I'm not overclocking, they have proper cleaning/air cooling, etc.... The RMA process is a nightmare for Australia to Taiwan office because they never pick up the phone (english, if you select Chinese they pick up immediately).A bit bummed because I've already spent 100$ in postage sending the RMA's back to the warehouse which means I could have bought a 1070 at this point.  I asked for a different card and both times they've sent me refurbed models that seem to break.My warranty is almost at the 3 year point and I'm afraid this 3rd card will break and I'll be out of luck.This is my 4th EVGA card in my lifetime (25+ years of gaming) and it might be my last sad to say. :("
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,This thing performs like crazy!!,2018-08-06,Pros:Runs really strong and decently cool. Sits around 65°c at full throttle.,Cons:It could look a little better.,"Other Thoughts:I bought this as kind of a filler until I could get a 1080ti or the next generation gpu when they come out. Now that I've got it and overclocked it, I don't know if I can justify upgrading. With all epic settings on Ark and some settings like shadows and sky effects turned down, I'm getting anywhere from 50 to 100fps easily. It's definitely putting me in a hard spot to upgrade..."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Aye,2018-07-13,"Pros:-EVGA swag is undeniably cool.  (Love their customer service.)-1080p on 1092x1024?  No problemo! (I might be getting older - but - I'm content with monitor as it is.-I turned on V-Sync and kept it on.  This plays all the current AAA titles like butter on bread.)-Below $300-Efficient and compact, baby!  (There's nothing quite like being able to remove power cords from a case.)","Cons:-Might only last a couple years at max settings in certain titles, but coming from a 760GTX with a stock of games I'm still enjoying from this generation - I'm not too worried.   (My next big upgrade will probably finally lift me off from the x58/1366 chipset.  Until then I have plenty left in this rig to get me by and so will you.)","Other Thoughts:It's louder, but not annoyingly so.  I was worried it'd be a jet turbine on liftoff compared to my dual-fan solution.   I haven't OC'd or messed with settings, but I hear it has some further potential there, too."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Its EVGA, don't think twice",2018-07-04,"Pros:Tiny card, packs a punch",Cons:its not a 1080ti,Other Thoughts:This thing is screaming to get cranked out with VR. Runs beautifully and does a whole lot of work while fitting more than comfortably in a mid-sized case. For someone who wouldn't typically overclock the SC does just fine.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Pretty beefy card for the price/size.,2018-07-02,Pros:It was pretty plug and play. Update the drivers on this baby beast and ride the dragon. It plays all my games at max setting and looks great doing it.,"Cons:Idk, I guess a con is that it's not a 1080?",Other Thoughts:I do recommend this little guy. It's compact and awesome.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Small, Tasty Card",2018-06-28,Pros:Good speed and quality you expect to get from EVGANice dust covers for ports that are not being used.,"Cons:It is an ""older"" technologyConstantly sold out (but that is because it sells fast)",Other Thoughts:The fan isn't THAT loud. I've never come across a system or component that was truly silent or quiet.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful little card,2018-06-27,"Pros:Its a small, powerful card.  1080p Gaming this is a card i'd recommened as long as your willing to turn down some settings sometimes to keep the frame rate up.","Cons:While small is a pro, its also a con in this case.  The small heatsink and fan make the card rev up a bit to stay cool.  Runs warmer unless you set a fan speed profile yourself to a higher level.",Other Thoughts:Good card all around.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great GPU,2018-06-23,"Pros:- Easy Install- Idles at 40, and under max load it's usually 69-71- Runs all my games on ultra between 60 - 150 fps (Modded Skyrim / Fallout 4, Doom, GTA V, Tetris, Pong)- No Coil Whine or other problems","Cons:- A bit more expensive than it used to be, but neither Newegg or EVGA are at fault for it obviously. $350 after taxes isn't bad for what I needed.- Fan is pretty loud when running games at Ultra with high frame rates, but it doesn't bother me because I wear headphones. It may be irritating to some people.","Other Thoughts:My first graphics card was a GT 660 (which could do little to nothing) and then I upgraded to a GTX 750 Ti (which could play old games like Portal and Bioshock), and finally upgraded to this. I had upgraded every other part of my PC but never got around to the GPU until now. To be honest, my main dream was to play modded Skyrim without going under 60fps, and this card was exactly what I needed. A little late for Skyrim hype, huh?The only reason not to recommend this card is the fan noise, but if you wear headphones like me, you won't notice it. I'm very satisfied with this GPU."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very Pleased,2018-05-18,Pros:Easy InstallFeels sturdy (some of the long 2 and 3 fan cards can feel too flexible)Nice upgrade for this PC (from an R9 380x that died)Low power consumption.,Cons:Price (but that's all graphics cards re; cryptomining),Other Thoughts:Replaced a dead card on the Frankenstein PC (made up of other PCs parts). So far works great and is a noticeable upgrade.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,It's great!,2018-04-28,"Pros:- I got this for 380 cad when it was on sale, it's a good card, it's small and compact, which is a bonus. bigger doesn't always mean better, this card performs really well even though it has 1 fan.- Can run battlefield 4 ultra in 120+ fps- Can run battlefield 1 ultra in 90+ frames- Can run fortnite ultra / high in 150 - 250 frames- Since it's 6gb it can serve you in the long run, it also future proofs it as new games will eventually consume more vram.",Cons:- Everything is fine so far.,"Other Thoughts:- Would recommend to people who would like to play on high / ultra, because this card can handle high settings.- Overall a great card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good card,2018-04-28,Pros:PerformanceBrand6 GBSmall size,Cons:High price right now,Other Thoughts:This card performs well and had 6 gb which is great for future proof. It is also small so it will fit most cases. EVGA is a good brand for video cards and well recommended. If you can find better price go ahead. You have to check everywhere and do price match when available to save a bit. I got mine under 400 cdn. I remove a star for the high price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product! High Price.,2018-04-25,Pros:Everything works fine and it is a great GPU,Cons:The inflated prices from cryptocurrency are a bit sad.,Other Thoughts:I bought this around Christmas and its still going strong.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing graphics,2018-04-16,"Pros:I’ve never been able to play a game on ultra settings with solid 100 FPS and no frame drop. Amazing. Really feels like this piece of hardware was put together well, somethings you can just feel in your hands and know it’s not cheaply made.",Cons:The price made me want to throw up but I bought it anyway. Lol this thing is LOUD under load. Sounds like your PC is about to get ready for liftoff as soon as you start gaming. Maybe the loudest I’ve ever heard for single fan GPU.,"Other Thoughts:Installation was cake. EVGA XOC software is somewhat confusing but manageable. I recommend checking out the fan speed settings, options are quiet mode etc. The card runs hot normally hence the high fan speeds even with good air flow in the case. Check your temps and maybe game with headphones. The only time the fan kicks into tornado mode is under ultra settings in games. Oh yeah I wish the crypto people would go away so gaming gpu prices can be reasonable again.Cheers"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card choice for less money,2018-04-15,Pros:I have used this card since it was released and I have not been let down. I have gone head to head with other flagship cards like the 1080ti and I had better performance. This card boosts up to 2113MHz if it is liquid cooled and stays under 25 degrees Celsius. This card has no problem handling 4K resolution without a significant drop in fps.,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:If you are looking for a good quality card like the 1080ti but don't have the money, then this card is for you."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic!,2018-04-06,Pros:-Runs Nearly everything on 1080p ultra-Low power consumption-Several EVGA programs and Nvidia program accessibility,Cons:-No VGA port,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,THE MIGHTY MEGA mini MACHINE,2018-03-14,Pros:Can run current gen games no problem.,Cons:4k Bottoms out a bit but that is expected. I run full 1080 Ultra everything on a 4K TV.,Other Thoughts:HUNT : Showdown almost at Full Settings no problem!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Easy 23MH for this card,2018-03-14,Pros:-Good for mining and gaming as well-Low power consumption and low noise,Cons:- Can't any find as of now any flaws,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance and a good price.,2018-03-10,"Pros:Excellent Performance. I was looking for a reasonably priced card that would play most games at no less than 60 fps at high settings. For the games played in my family, this has far exceeded those expectations.Price was competitive compared to other cards in the 1060 family. Nearest card with comparable specs and reviews was fifty bucks more.","Cons:None so far. I've been running it less than a week. If anything changes, I'll update the review.","Other Thoughts:Easy to install. The only problem I had was finding one of the 6-pin power cables for my modular PS.  Obviously, not a fault of the card. It came with a install DVD, but my rig has no player, so I had to download from GeForce's website. Easy to find, and no issues there. Card came up in default resolution as expected. I ran the install, and it's worked flawlessly since."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,hynix memory on evga lol,2018-02-28,Pros:performance is good unless you are unlucky and got a card with hynix memory like I didit's does run hot but not that much for single fan it's a pretty good cooling and it fits in my mini itx builds just fine,Cons:fans are loud under load like annoying loud (I read reviews saying fans were quiet haha I don't think they are quiet unless you are deaf just saying),Other Thoughts:I have 3 of these on builds but my very recent card has hynix memory prices went up for 300 to 359 and for what from micron to hynix downgrade lol ok evga I think it's time to switch to some other company now
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,These Video cards arent as fast as they use to be when it comes to mining Ether :(,2018-02-21,"Pros:Unfortunately, there isn't anything that I can say that's positive.  I spent way more than twice of what its worth and it underperformed others of the same make and model number!  Yes, there is a positive!  Now I know not to buy this model of video card anymore.","Cons:For whatever reason, Out of the box they only put out 15.3 MHs instead of 19.8 MHs when mining Ether, that's about 18% drop in MHs from previous cards of the exact same make and model?","Other Thoughts:Don't buy this card if you plan on using it for mining Ethereum, waste of good money.  If You're a gamer, it's probably fine, just expensive like all of the cards out there."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great product but the fan is indeed loud!,2018-02-18,Pros:Great performance for the price!Very small will fit in any tower that's for sure.Replace my GTX 760 2GB and I definitely see a big difference. Most game can be played on Ultra and High settingsBF1 is between high and UltraPUBG is mostly on ultra and some very low setting like foliage XD helps u see the sneakers in the bushFallout 4 ultra all the wayYou get the idea !,Cons:Fan was ok at first but after a few weeks it started to be loudly noticeable! But only when playing games it does!I just put my headset or put the music louder on speakerMy towers' fans were already loud but that just beats it !Maybe I would have bought the double fans gc instead but you just get used to it !,"Other Thoughts:If you have an old geezer card like mine was with 2GB, I definitely recommend you buying this card you won't regret it!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing little card,2018-02-15,"Pros:-Runs very quietly, even under load-High framerates in every game I play-Low power consumption-Small size",Cons:-Runs a little hot due to single-fan design-Not a 1080 Ti,None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,One of the best cards I've had,2018-01-29,"Pros:-Small length, only 6.8 inches, so it leaves space inside the case. (I'm using a Phanteks P400)-6GB, better than 3GB for graphic-intensive games-Easy to install-Mine came with an EVGA poster, thanks EVGA","Cons:-Noticably loud during intensive gaming, (Can't really hear it whenever I have my headphones in, so it doesn't bother me.)",None

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Amazing card but giving me some issues,2018-01-24,Pros:This card eats every game I play with ease. PUBG runs great maxed out at 1080. I don't really have any intense games but i'm really happy with what it can handle for me. For only having one fan it stays pretty cool and the factory over clocking is really nice.,"Cons:Whenever I start my PC cold, I get multiple issues. Sometimes one of my monitors is at 800x600 while the other is at the native. Sometimes one screen is black and the other has artifacts, and usually neither screen has any picture. When I hit the reset button, both screens come back just fine.It's not a terrible issue but it shouldn't be happening and I'm worried it's a precursor to the card failing down the road.","Other Thoughts:It's a little loud when games are running, but with headphones on who cares?If I wasn't getting the display errors this card would be 5/5. I'm so glad I bought it before these insane price increases and shortages."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Great buy for the price (this was when I bought the card),2018-01-23,"Pros:Small size, low power, pretty good performance",Cons:Price increases since I bought the card,"Other Thoughts:I bought this card for my son just a month ago and a month later it is 2x the price.  I'm saying it now, unless this changes, this will end PC gaming as we know it.  I bought my 1070 almost 3 years ago for $429 and today that same card is nearly $1,000.  This is to nVidia and AMD:  you guys might like the prices now, but keep in mind game developers are looking at the future and if I'm a developer, I'm building my company around consoles and maybe porting a stripped-down version to the pc.Consoles can skirt the cryptocurrency wars by having their GPUs built directly for them so that only their products can use them.  That keeps the prices down.  I do see console prices going up to reflect GPU price increases, but not the 100% markup I've seen over the last month with discrete cards.  This has been going on for 2 years now so if this doesn't stop soon, PC gaming is dead.  No way would I ever buy a 1060 for the prices they are fetching now.  My son would have to make due with the 670 he had and just turn down settings.I said this when CUDA first arrived that I could see video cards costing thousands because the performance of a typical video card today is far, far, far, far more powerful than even the best servers CPUs.  I worried even then that video cards would be the new CPU where code developers used the GPU to run everything from servers to crunching algorithms (like password breaking)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great if it keeps its drivers,2018-01-22,"Pros:Great for 1080p gaming, 200+ fps on Counterstrike, 70+ fps on Playerunkown and sorta good for mining.",Cons:My device manager seems to always give code 43 whenever I try to boot up Garry's Mod and It gives me a Microsoft Basic Render Driver whenever I boot up Insurgency. This is all hooked up to a 60hz TV(Not a monitor) Via HDMI.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great little card with one big drawdown,2018-01-20,Pros:-great for gaming-6 gigs of memory is great,Cons:very bad cooler compared to other evga cards.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"Great GFX card, 6GB is crazy for such a small card...BUT...",2018-01-18,Pros:- Very compact card- 6 GB GDDR5- Played most games on High/Max- Would of gave it a solid 5 egg rating if it was still working.,"Cons:- Bought it in late October of 2017, randomly stopped working 1/18/2018Checked all cables, it was snapped in, and the fan was not even spinning.Through in my old GTX 460, boom everything was working.- I like EVGA and have had no complaints about them, hopefully my RMA gets resolved soon!",None

Solid 24/7 operation!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Evga gtx  1060 6GB SC,2017-12-23,Pros:Easy to installFits in almost any caseRuns games great!,Cons:The noise is the only con I've found. During heavy tasks the single fan can get quiet noisy. I somewhat fixed this by limiting my clock speed and not letting my card boost so high. I was seeing upwards of 2ghz and that's when the fan really ramped up.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card for the price.,2017-12-16,Pros:Not really willing to shell out a whole lot of money on my current set up which has an old Ivy Bridge i7. T,Cons:None so far after 30+ days of use.,"Other Thoughts:his is a siginificant upgrade to my AMD Radeon 6870 1GB card. I was in CrossFire set up, but so few games actually take advantage of that and then one of the two cards died. Was relying on just the 1 Radeon for a while til its fan died. I had actually replaced the fan on the other card that died a few years ago. Anyway, rather than replace the fan (again), I opted to just bight the bullet and get the card. Completely worth it and has played all games I throw at it without breaking a sweat (Skryim, Total War franchise games, DOOM)."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performer.  Loud by Default,2017-12-15,Pros:- Performs as it should.- Small profile with respectable cooling performance.- Great customer service from EVGA.,"Cons:The default fan curve is a bit too aggressive for my tastes.  Fan speeds ramp up to 50+% before the card even hits 70C and it can be pretty loud.  This is easily remedied if you use MSI Afterburner or other control software.  Once I made those adjustments, the card was much quieter with only a couple of degrees increase in temperature.  Other than that, I have no issues with this card.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING 6GB,2017-12-05,"Pros:Stable 60+ FPS @ 1080P in most current games.Good looking cardSmall Size, fit in any case.","Cons:LOUD LOUD LOUD IT'S VERY NOISY AT FULL LOAD,And if you try to adjust fan speed ( with afterburner or EVGA Software ) it will result in more heat (70+ C).",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,A bit finicky but still amazing,2017-12-03,"Pros:Extremely powerful for its price (Able to run DOOM on Ultra with no issues)Small, so it fits effectively every form factor MOBO (aside from ITX)","Cons:Mine had a weird incident where it became unrecognized by Windows though I believe this was due to the 11/30/2017 driver update NVIDIA put out as I had no issues until the day after I'd applied it. This required me to run off integrated graphics (or a separate GPU if you lack integrated graphics), uninstall the card through device manager, then reinstall after shut down.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card!,2017-12-03,Pros:- Great performance.- Small size fits in most cases and enclosures.- Reasonably priced.,Cons:- Noisy out of the box. It's very quiet until the fan speed reaches 50% speed.,"Other Thoughts:For anyone complaining about the noisy fan, use MSI after burner or any kind of overclocking tool and set the fan profile to quiet mode, or manually set the fan speed to 50% max. The gpu temp will increase to mid 80s, but the fan noise is pretty much inaudible."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wonderful flexability,2017-12-03,Pros:-Preforms well overall-Keeps rather cool for a single fan GPU-Plenty of connections for multiple monitor setups,Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Swell!,2017-11-30,Pros:- 60 FPS on all my games.- Quiet.,Cons:- Nothing yet,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic video card!,2017-11-22,"Pros:DIsclaimer:  I use these for mining crypto coins, and am seeing these run 24/7 at max capacity.  I currently have a total of 24 video cards mining.The heatsink design on this card is much more efficient than it's competitors.  I also purchased the 3GB version of the EVGA 1060, and here's how they perform:Out of the box mining Zcash with EWBF miner (stock settings):1060 6GB - 325H/s @ 65C1060 3GB - 280 H/s @ over 85CWith the GPU clock at 2050(ish - it varies a little while running) and MEM clock at about 4500.1060 6GB - 330-340 H/s1060 3GB - 300-305 H/sIn conclusion, this card runs about 10-15% faster out of the box, and is at least 20C cooler while doing it.  I see complaints about the fan, but I'm not seeing it here.  These run literally all day long, OC'd, and none of them ever even approach 70C, and I have yet to see one running at over 50% fan speed to keep them that cool.","Cons:Because of idiot miners like me, these cost more than they should.  No cons about the card itself.  Again, this thing is fantastic!","Other Thoughts:Buy it.  For gaming, for 3D modeling, or for mining.  You won't regret it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card when you're limited on space,2017-11-16,"Pros:Great card, runs everything well. Never goes above 70 degrees. Silent operation on most games.",Cons:The fan is very noticeable on games such Overwatch and Battlefield 1.,"Other Thoughts:Definitely recommend this card for those that are limited on space. It would be nice if the fan was quieter on games that push the card. Given the performance, I would buy again."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge perfomance in a small package,2017-11-16,"Pros:Small form factor, Well built solid card, Easy to install, ""Worked in my NON-UEFI Motherboard"", Very Quiet, Low power usage, Very low temps, Came with excellent software package for easy driver installations and game setting optimizations As well as Precision-XOC for effortless overclocking, Came with a poster, stickers and a badge to show off your love for EVGA and Nvidia.","Cons:After installing on windows 10 i could not open nvidia control panel, it would say there was no Nvidia graphics card installed. Had me worried at first. I had to dig around a bit, not much though, I find out it was disabled in windows device manager by default. I don't know if this is a windows 10 issue or if this is done to avoid driver or other issues, so it might not really be a con as this might not be the case for everyone. But right-clicking the card in device manager and selecting enabled did the trick.","Other Thoughts:Shipping was amazing, only 2-days ground domestic, and was packaged very well both by Newegg and EVGA.

What a difference, I can't even put into words how much. Even with my older hardware this changed gaming for me i a big way. I am so happy i decided to go with EVGA. I used to be a AMD\ATI guy but this has affected me so much, I could never go back. I would definitely recommend this product. Do yourself a favor buy this card. 6GB is worth the extra $."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,small and great overclock,2017-11-15,"Pros:Small card, very good overclock on memory",Cons:Noisier than the 2 fan ones but still very good noise level,Other Thoughts:With more and more game going 4gb+ textures it's worth the extra cash to get the 6gb version!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Terrific graphics card!,2017-11-15,"Pros:-Very simple to set up, configure and install-Runs most all old games at ultra settings, and new games at high and ultra settings at 1080p, as well as 1440-Quiet, efficient and well designed","Cons:- Some of the software that allows clocking configuration has a bit of a learning curve and isn't entirely intuitive, but with some practice it makes sense.",Other Thoughts:Highly recommend. The perfect high-end card for those on a budget.  Performance is superb
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card,2017-11-15,"Pros:Great performance for a small factor card, quiet and cool. Full load temps @ 60deg with fan at 50 percent.",Cons:None that I can think of.,"Other Thoughts:At first I wasn't too sure about this card but shen it went on sale, I decided what the heck. My main concern was if the single fan was going to be enough to keep the card cool at full load. To my surprise it does but I think that it helps that I've got a case with 5 fans running."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nvidia still makes a great product,2017-11-05,Pros:Easy installNvidia reliability and featuresBeautiful and well performing,Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:A very strong card. I don't game nearly as much as I used to, but I have noticed I've been playing more and more after building a new rig a couple months ago.Been on a GTX 550ti for years (still works, still a relatively good card) in an old box with all outdated tech and it was really unenjoyable. I chalked it up to me getting older and not caring as much but actually it was because I didn't realize just how horrible the experience was.Anyway, the card is great and I just ordered a new 24"" 144hz 1ms IPS to compliment it. Been on an old 21"" 60hz TN for quite a while and believe if you have a card this great, might as well get as much as possible out of it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent,2017-11-03,"Pros:- Fast card, can play any games I play at highest settings 1080p (Fortnite, Overwatch, PUBG, etc.)- Quiet. Fan turns off when idle during cool temps. Automatically turns on and adjusts RPM under load.- Small, fits in my mATX case very well and leaves plenty of room for other things.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great card for the money,2017-10-14,"Pros:- Much better single fan cooling solution then the non SC EVGA card.- Plays everything at 1080, you'll have to turn down settings if you want to support a 144hz monitor though.- Can barely hear it running.",Cons:- It's not a 1080 Ti.,Other Thoughts:Using the standard shipping this took about a week to get to me in Edmonton from BC. Yey Canada post.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid entry mining card,2017-10-14,Pros:Really great card if you are looking to start doing crypto mining. Stock rates for Ether are about 19MH/s and you can overclock to 22MH/s. You can even reduce the wattage down from 120W to 90W and still get 22MH/s.,Cons:none,None

Comes pretty close though!,Other Thoughts:I've had this card now for about 3 months and I am beyond pleased. Worth every single penny. If you are looking at building a mid-range build with a single card then this is no doubt the card for you. This sucker packs a wallop and don't listen to the clowns that say you do not need 6GB VRAM and to go with the 3GB. I have already ran into a couple games that do indeed use up more than 3GB.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good gaming card,2017-10-13,Pros:- quiet- only one 6 pin pcie needed,Cons:- a little loud when fan at 100%,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Rock Solid as usual for EVGA,2017-10-09,Pros:-Quite-Powerful-Small-Load temps where fantastic,Cons:-If you want something pretty to look at through your case window might go for something else (maybe dual fan version)...?,"Other Thoughts:The stock specs put it at ""Core Clock 1607 MHz"" and a ""Boost Clock 1835 MHz"" but putting it under GPU load for hours, *my* card never got higher then 75c and stayed stable at 1925MHz under its own boost with no overclocking. Got really lucky with this card, it boosts farther and runs cooler then it seems most consumers have gotten. This is my *use case* situation and your mileage will vary, regardless its such a great card for the price.... IF that price can stay near is MSRP.... Or you can catch it on sale ;)I never noticed any real noise even at full load, custom fan profiles going above 60% fan is gonna make noise regardless though, and with a fan profile maxed at 100% it would boost to 1980 on it's own which is super impressive for the card.VR-StuffYes it can do VR and do it very nicely, keep in mind though its at the low end of VR. With it you can get started with and enjoy most VR games  (without SS being adjusted) and plays great. This card with a Ryzen 3 can get you a VR system for under $500-$600 which is way better then it was a year ago.Your standard games have enough articles and youtube videos on the subject but to simplify, Plays games at 1080p flawlessly with often high-epic settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good video card,2017-10-08,"Pros:- Good video card for the lowest model from 10xx- Not very noisy (my case is also silent so that helps)- You can tune it with software- Supports all types of features (nvshield, geforce optimizier, VR etc)",Cons:- Don't expect to run every new game on highest settings. I run WoW on 10 with FPS drops in raids sometimes.- Nothing else as cons. Pretty good video card overall for its prize,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Really good !,2017-09-27,"Pros:Love it , plug and play temps are good and really good fps",Cons:only 1 fan so when its get hot the fan make a good amount of sound,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great for 1080p Gaming. Maybe a Bit Overkill?,2017-09-27,Pros:-Running most games at high/ultra settings easily over 60 fps paired with an intel i5 4690 and 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz Ram. Feels good man.jpg.-Overclocked it over 2000Mhz clock speed and over 9000/4500Mhz VRAM. Not too shabby!,"Cons:-Really don't have any negative things to say, just nitpicks like:-No backplate to help mitigate the card drooping/warping from it's own weight.-More overhead for overclocking would be nice, though not sure if it's just my card though (silicon lottery).-The Price. I got this for ~$270 (minus S&H). Granted this is the SC version but still.","Other Thoughts:So out of curiosity and boredom, I enabled Nvidia's Dynamic Screen Resolution/DSR for 1440p and 4k resolutions. I ran Prey with 4k selected and most settings to high just to see what my system can handle (and a couple of features like motion blur disabled, vsync off, and AA at x2). What I got was ~30 FPS in the Shuttle Bay. Granted it's not native resolution, and there wasn't much going on, but still that was surprising to see. @1440p, I got around 70 fps with the same settings, so I think this card can handle it fairly well.The non SC version should work just fine as well, so if you want to save a bit of money you should get that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very solid card,2017-09-26,"Pros:Great Price-to-Performance Ratio.Not too big. People call it tiny, but it's not!Relatively quiet. Can get a little loud at fan speeds over 60 percent.",Cons:No back-plate!More CUDA cores would have made it truly great. 1200 plus is plenty but 1600 or 2000 would have been even better for professional applications.,"Other Thoughts:I have used this for mainly playing Arkham Knight at Ultra settings and it blew my mind but that is not my ultimate goal. My main focus was to use this for rendering in Maya and maybe compositing, but so far I've only used it a few times to model in Maya and did one single walk cycle with a dog and those are hardly stressing on the system and the graphics card. So the jury is still out on the professional capabilities of this card. If it performs at the same level as a 980 card, so I know it won't disappoint. At first I was going to get me a WX 3100 Radeon Pro card for 3d and animation but when I looked at the benchmarks and realized how much more powerful this was for a little more, I bought this. But I am hopeful it will hold up well. Considering that most people buy Radeon for value, this card currently makes any RX card pointless in a price to performance ratio, until this Ethereum business slows down and those RX cards go back to the prices they were when they first came out."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,1,stops computers from working,2017-09-21,Pros:nice graphics while it works very quite and compact,Cons:after about six months it stopped working and stopped my computer or any computer its plugged into from booting up,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Very Loud,2017-09-10,Pros:-Small: Fits into a mATX case with room to spare-Powerful: Almost as good as the 980 for a fraction of the price-Low Power: Only requiring one 6 pin PCI-E plug and 150 watts makes it a good upgrade without having to get a new PSU,Cons:-At 30% fan speed the temperature is above 80C yet the fan is somehow louder than the stock fx-8350 fan-At 90% fan speed the temperature is around 70C but the fan is so loud it can be heard through headphones,Other Thoughts:-If you can fit a bigger graphics card in your case I would suggest going with a two fan version of the card-Any fan speed over 30% sounds just as loud so you might as well go the full 90% in you want your card running any lower than 80C
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-08-31,"Pros:-Fast, plays overwatch at max at 90-130FPS-Works well with my AMD FX-8370-Can play any game I play at high to ultra settings",Cons:-Not a GTX 1080ti,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,tiny monster,2017-08-23,Pros:small...its only 6 inches but don't let the size fool you this thing is very powerful runs games no prob smooth and sexy.,Cons:no backplate if your into that sort of thing.,Other Thoughts:catch it on sale and its even a better deal.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Great card at a great price, but loud.  I regret not paying a little extra for a full-size and quieter card.",2017-08-03,"Pros:Some of the best price per performance, while leaning just a little into the ""more power"" area.Nvidia card for a G-Sync monitor.Every ATi card I ever had back in the day burned out, on one component or another.  Been rockin' Nvidia for years and years now with no issue.","Cons:This card is too loud for my tastes.  It's annoying.  Even over loud game audio on headphones.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy the small form card just to save a little bit of money (my case is massive; saving ~$20 was the only reason).Still, I will only dock it one egg because it's still a great card at a great price.","Other Thoughts:The REAL thing that drove me here was to do just a little bit to spread the word about the rebate cards EVGA is offering.  They give you a choice: check or debit card - choose the check.  I have yet to find a place that will accept the card, and I'm getting pretty aggravated with it.  I'd have paid $30 to not have to go through this hassle."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"This card is a beast!  Small, compact, 6-pin power, fast GPU!",2017-07-31,"Pros:Pros- small profile- 6-pin PCIe power- quiet fan- No need for OCing, fast out of the box, never exceeded 70C.- Takes load off your CPU, no more bottlenecking- 60-120 FPS every game ULTRA settings.- Vulkan API built in, frame rate doubled with DOOM 2016.- future proof with 6gb of ram- still super fast on old PC with PCIe 1.1","Cons:- No thermal pad on VRM but no problem with overheating, don't worry about it.- Geforce Experience Application is junk.  Had issues with drivers and kept crashing during latest update version.  Solution = rollback drivers, then reinstall update, choose custom install, check GPU Driver and PhysX only, check clean install.  Problem solved.  This is my only reason for giving it 4 stars.",Other Thoughts:This card has transformed my computer.  I'm running an older PC 2008 with dual 2.8ghz (8 core) CPUs (E5462).  My old graphics card R7 250X 1GB couldn't keep up.  The CPU kept bottle necking and the frames would drop.  I started to realized maybe my computer was too old or it was the graphics card.  Instead of building a new PC I bought the card first to see if it would make a difference and let me tell you this GPU is incredible!I used to struggle running DOOM 2016 and Battlefront.  I ran low graphics on everything and now since installing the EVGA 1060 SC 6GB I can run everything on ULTRA settings with min 60-120 FPS.  My computer no longer bottlenecks and it's like I have a brand new machine.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,go stuff,2017-07-27,Pros:Nice,Cons:Nice,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"good card, runs well but having issues with fan and heat",2017-07-23,Pros:-runs 1080p 60fps quite well,"Cons:-either my s340 case or this 1060 was slightly defective because screwing in the card required me to bend the back of the case with considerable force-idle temps are usually fine, 40-50C but when playing gpu intensive games the card can go up to the high 70s and is very loud, almost like a small hair dryer in my case",Other Thoughts:-might look into liquid cooling this with the kraken g12
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING - 06G-P4-6163-KR,2017-07-19,"Pros:Small and fast, and I only paid $189 for it from Newegg back in the middle of June with free next day shipping. I got this as an exchange for a defective card, the model I sent back was out of stock when they were setting the exchange up. They offered me this card for the same price as the one I returned. It was the first and only time in 17 years that I returned an item to Newegg.I'm very happy with the card and Newegg's service. The card is overkill for me but I wasn't going to pass up a great deal on it and it will be in my system for at least the next 4 years just like my last one. I don't upgrade as much as I used to because I don't play as many games as I used to, as in I hardly play any now.",Cons:None.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,Acting Up,2017-07-14,Pros:Great GPU when it works.DayZ Standalone gets 150+ FPS on very high settings,Cons:I'll load up any game and then after roughly 10 minutes of gaming all of a sudden the GPU will crash and the fan will jump to 100% speed. It happens every time and I am extremely disappointed.,Other Thoughts:I spent $250 on a card that doesn't work but for about 10 minutes of gaming...
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great thermals and no clearance issues.,2017-07-11,"Pros:The size of this card was the most influential part of buying this card. Another factor is that i have seen it go to about $230 ( after rebate) . It also overclocks extremely well, i got it to do a 300 mhz  without changing anything else and just left it cause im not to experienced with overclocking and it stays under 60 c the whole time after hours of gaming. And the ambient temps are 77-79 F ( side panel off) .","Cons:From what i have seen i will say that the rx 580 outperforms the 1060, but if you really want some of the features of geforce experience or your case doesn't fit a standard  sized card ( because all of the rx 580 on the market now are about 9 inches or bigger) or you are a green team fan boy then go with the 1060.","Other Thoughts:If you buy a 3gb version than you cannot call it a true 1060, more like a 1055 ti. just buy the 6gb version instead of making your system ram do your gpus job. But consider the rx 580 even if you despise the people who make mini little silicon ovens over at amd."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2017-06-30,Pros:- strong enough to handle most anything I throw at it.- video memory to spare.- despite being a single fan it runs fairly cool. Only hits 55c running Forza Horizon 3.- insanely quiet.- lower power draw than my previous card.- small form factor.,Cons:- the steadily climbing price.- had to fiddle a little bit with bios settings to get it working properly with my motherboard. Enabling the PCI legacy mode did the trick.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Eh, it's OK",2017-06-28,"Pros:Pre overclocked is good, decent performance for such a stubby little card, cooler seems effective enough for me.","Cons:GeForce Experience is an awful disaster, for some reason cs go runs like horribly shutter sputter 15-25 fps.","Other Thoughts:I got it before the major price hike. Don't install GFE well you have to to get the free game but get rid out it after. Like I said cs go runs horribly but Just Cause 3 runs great so the card isn't defective it's something wrong with cs go. I have both the Rx 580 8GB and this GTX1060 6GB my old card was R9 280x 3GB, the 580/1060 really are the new mid level cards for 1080p.Temps and noise aren't too bad very cool ambient 66-68f  %100 load runs 65c fan %51, warm room 72f+ the card ramps up the fan to try and keep it no more than 70c so it gets a little loud but not as loud as an old single fan HD6870 I have.Over all it's an interesting little card, if you get it for a reasonable price it's fine and realize that a single fan card is a little louder than dual and triple fan cards it's just common sense."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2017-06-26,"Pros:- Very powerful for it's size.- Great quality, you can tell it's a great quality card just by it's weight.  It's pretty heavy for it's size.- Plays all my games on ultra setting in 1080p at >60FPS.","Cons:- People have complained about the noise of the fan, but I can't hear mine at all with it running at full load.  I think it's because I have great air flow in my case, so it doesn't get hot enough for the fan to ramp up.  So in other words, so con's for me.","Other Thoughts:I'll be honest, when I first saw this card, I immediately disregarded it because of it's size.  I wanted a full size SSC or a card with at least 2-fans.  But with the prices going up on the other cards right now, I had no choice but to purchase this card.  Well, I have no regrets what-so-ever.  This card runs cool, and performs absolutely amazing.  I love it, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a powerful graphics card at a good price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice card,2017-06-24,Pros:- small- 6-pin power connector- 50-100% better fps vs GTX 660 while also moving graphics from medium-high to ultra,"Cons:dvi -> display-port adapters don't work, if your running dual dvi use a dvi to hdmi adapter.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic. Runs cool and super stable.,2017-06-20,Pros:Great mid range card. Runs pretty much everything I throw at it at over 100 FPS on Ultra settings. Super easy install.,Cons:None.,Other Thoughts:If you want a card that will run everything on Ultra for the next 2 or 3 years you got your card right here.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-06-17,Pros:Very powerful for it's price,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card, especially for it's price to performance ratio."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Product! Love EVGA Products,2017-05-05,Pros:- Stays cool- easy install-comes with a nice program that keeps track of fan speed and heat ext...,Cons:-fan can be loud at times,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Awesome!,2017-05-05,"Pros:FPS on Overwatch with an I3 6100 on epic is 90-170! On Ghost Recon Wildlands and on pretty high settings, it's like 55-100 ish. Upgraded from a 750TI which would run 60-80 FPS on Ultra settings in Overwatch. Ghost Recon is a really pretty game!","Cons:The fan can be a little loud at times on Ghost recon, but it could be because of the lack of air flow in my case. It's pretty big for a smaller card, but it fit in my case so no worries.",Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend if your looking for a smaller card that will run pretty much all the games you play.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Good but not great,2017-05-05,Pros:- Compact form factor- Good price point for level of performance,"Cons:- Not terribly loud, but certainly louder than my GTX 460 Cyclone 1GD5/OC from MSI which was whisper quite because it didn't use these stupid air duct designs and instead relied on a large fan with heat pipes from the chipset.  That MSI Cyclone was rock solid and I would buy it again in a heartbeat if they refreshed its design for the GTX 1060.- I really don't like the air duct cooling  arrangement for graphics cards, but I have no other choice because I don't see anything like my old card on the market any more and I do not want to deal with the upkeep of a liquid cooled design.","Other Thoughts:- I bought this card once as an upgrade from a GTX 460 and it worked for a few evenings of gaming before dying and (it would appear) taking the motherboard down with it (I tried both the old card and the onboard video, but could no longer get a signal on my monitor).  I am confident that it was compatible with my system and well within the capabilities of my power supply, so it was very likely a faulty card.  The replacement card I received has so far been working fine so hopefully it was a fluke.  Though I much would have preferred not having to replace my entire machine in the process."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge upgrade from a GTX 760 at a ridiculously low price!,2017-04-23,Pros:Fits easily in mid sized case. Running new games on ultra quite easily. The single fan keeps temps well in cool range on heavy loads (Witcher 3 maxed including Hairworks) and is very quiet. A no brainer upgrade on a budget.,"Cons:Just wish this had LEDs, but that is just flavor :)",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wonderful little beast!,2017-04-22,"Pros:- Very powerful little thing- Small form factor is a HUGE plus for future builds- Only 150W TDP / PCIe Power cable!- Installation was a breeze. It worked flawlessly plug and play on my old S5520SC Mobo- Drivers were easy to install and worked out of the box (make sure to download from nVidia site instead of the provided drivers, and to use DDU tool to remove your old drivers completely before that. You can search google for DDU, it's easy).- Runs anything very smoothly on 1080P and Ultra settings.- Looks really ""sexy""!- EVGA support and community (a real plus)- EVGA software easily adjusts the fan curve or over/under clocks the card","Cons:Can't think of any, but if only it had a backplate that would be nice. This would prevent dust from accumulating on it, but that's barely an issue.","Other Thoughts:Coming from an old ATI Radeon HD 5770 this is a huge boost for my rig.I'm really happy I bought this, especially the 6GB version. This card is a huge bang for buck! I find it way worthy that the larger and more expensive cards from its tier.I can't imagine a better choice for 1080P gaming given the size and price. Just bear in mind that it's not designed for extreme 4K performance so don't judge it for that."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic product,2017-04-21,Pros:Easy installExcellent performanceReasonably priced,Cons:I have no criticisms,Other Thoughts:I would absolutely recommend this product.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Finally Got a good Card!,2017-04-20,"Pros:-Pretty good price to performance, i haven't found a game that this cant run well",Cons:-The heat can get a little out of control sometimes,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Amazing GPU, for the price!",2017-04-19,Pros:- The GPU is very affordable- The Base clock speeds are very high- For a single fan GPU over clocks well- Stays cool even under high loads- Easily the best GPU that you can get for the $250 price range,Cons:- NONE!,"Other Thoughts:- Been running the card in 2560 x 1440 and have had no issues with games, playing most in high settings."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great little card at a slightly awkward price point,2017-04-19,"Pros:As a higher-end budget card, there's not a lot more you could ask for: performance reportedly approaching a GTX 980 for less than $250, plus a small form factor for convenient installation and a solid factory overclock. I put it inside a mini-ITX build to replace a dying 2GB 960, and now it plays Dark Souls 3 on ultra at a rock-solid 1080/60fps without even approaching max usage. With a custom, more aggressive fan curve, doesn't get over 70 degrees Celsius on the Heaven benchmark.EVGA delivers its usual no-nonsense aesthetics and good build quality (they even included a case badge!), and the smaller card fits in my Fractal Design Core 500 with plenty of room to spare (especially compared to the monstrously gigantic MSI card it replaced). The Precision XOC utility is handy too.","Cons:Gets very loud with fan speed over about 50%. I recommend headphones to drown out its tortured screaming.No LEDs, if that's your thing.As other reviewers have said, where this card lies in terms of performance is a little odd: maybe a bit more than what you need for 1080p, maybe a little less than what you need for 1440p. It's definitely not bad at either, but the RX 480/580 and the 3GB 1060 are only a little bit worse at 1080p for significantly less money. I probably wouldn't have replaced even my 960 if it wasn't for the thought of going through a month-long RMA process with MSI all for the sake of a card I'd probably replace in a year or two anyway.That said, if you need 1080p/60fps performance at max settings AND a small form factor, then this card is probably one of your very few choices, and likely the best -- so go ahead and grab it!",Other Thoughts:I'd probably pick this over ZOTAC's mini 1060s just on the basis of clock speeds.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Review for: 1060 SC Gaming ACX 2.0 Single Fan 6GB,2017-04-18,"Pros:Pros:Runs cool -- 28C-32C idle, 60~C while in gameQuiet fan (Unless you are running at 80%+ fan speed, and if you do - reconsider your life)Powerful card (I've yet to experience less than 60 FPS)Good price",Cons:No SLI,"Other Thoughts:Excellent videocard. Small, efficient and mostly quiet. Great video card for gaming at 1080p."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great mid range graphics card!,2017-04-18,Pros:- EVGA warranty- Runs cool- Perfect 1080p gaming card- So far no issues after 6+ months,Cons:- Price to performance isn't the best- None,Other Thoughts:This is a great little 1060 and won't let you down!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice and compact,2017-04-18,"Pros:This card uses lot less wattage for the power it puts out, easy keeps me above 60 fps in all my games",Cons:haven't found any cons yet,Other Thoughts:I would gladly recommend this graphics card
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Significantly better than my 960 SSC!,2017-04-18,"Pros:-Games look and run so much better than on my old 960 SSC.-Quieter than my old 960.-Smaller, lighter, and no sag at all.","Cons:-An SLI slot would be nice, but that doesn't affect me.","Other Thoughts:-It would be nice to be able to have the fan run without having to use PrecisionX. What I mean is that the fan does run, but only when it gets super hot, which I can't imagine being good for the life of the card. I could be wrong, of course. I'd like to not have to run PrecisionX just to keep the card at a temperature I feel is safe. Again, I could be completely wrong about what's good for the card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Outstanding Card,2017-04-18,Pros:Smaller sizeIncredible PerformanceLow Power ConsumptionRuns Quietly,Cons:Not worth mentioning.,"Other Thoughts:Bought to replace my 770 FTW (EVGA).  I needed a smaller card with a better power usage rating.  What I got was a card that met those requirements and doubled the performance of my 770 FTW.  According to the Heaven Benchmark Utility, the 1060 out performed my 770 by double.  I strongly recommend this card.  It has not had any issue running any games thus far. From Minecraft through DOOM it has done a very nice job."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card since the GTX 460,2017-04-18,"Pros:Price to performance reminds me of the GTX 460 days.  No issues at all in almost a year of ownership.  Runs cool, whisper quiet.  Perfect solution for 1080p setup for gaming amd graphic arts.  Single fan and short card made for a perfect micro atx solution.  No coil whine, folds like a champ.",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Bought at launch amd has been in use round the clock since.  Looks dinky now that it has been moved to a full ATX case setup.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Little Card - Fast and Quiet,2017-04-18,Pros:-Great price/performance point-Single-fan version runs quiet and cool.-Small card was nice and easy to install,Cons:-wasn't free,"Other Thoughts:-I was skeptical that I needed 6GB of VRAM, but was surprised how many games use more than 4. Glad I didn't cheap out and get the 3GB version (which is also clocked slower).-Not sure why anyone would need a 2-fan version."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product!,2017-04-18,Pros:- Small model with low power usage- Runs most of the games I play extremely well,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:If you're looking to run the hardcore games on max settings, this probably won't be enough. But for mid/high settings this is a great card for the price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,a tiny cannon,2017-04-18,Pros:small but strong,Cons:none till now,"Other Thoughts:Though I put it in a mid-tower case, it is definitely suitable for smaller case as the temperature is always low. Userbenchmark.com showed my  graphic card is beyond the average of 1060s before the 3gb version was released."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card. Great Value,2017-04-18,Pros:Performs as expected.Price is terrific.Size is convenient for small builds.,Cons:None other than high temps but thats fine in a single fan gpu.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2017-04-18,"Pros:It's a nice, compact card at a great price that made building a HTPC very reasonable. It's also going to be used for a VR headset in the near future.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great product by EVGA,2017-04-15,"Pros:Powerful, small and compact.  Does a great job in my HTPC.  I have purchased 10s of dozens of EVGA products, I have had one fail (x79 mobo with faulty USB).  Wonderful product.  Exactly what I needed in my HTPC.","Cons:Due to my use of it in an HTPC, if the body was the same size and on the same plane as the back mount,that could be an improvement.  It is a tight fit in an HTPC case with the power cables coming from the top, or you could place the power cables coming from the back and heck, you got another 1/4"" height wise to play with.","Other Thoughts:Yes.  Whether it is for a budget gaming system, if you want to run VR, or if you use it like me for 4k streaming, well worth it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Wowzers!,2017-04-11,"Pros:I previously ordered the 06G-P4-6267-KR but due to poor placement of my SATA ports it just wouldn't fit! Just too BIG, so I got this card instead, and it is 6.8 Inches of PURE PLEASURE!I've got the performance of the larger card, but in a smaller package.",Cons:Heat dissipation is mediocre.,Other Thoughts:It's a great step up from the onboard GPU.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,exceded my expectations,2017-04-03,"Pros:This exceeded my expections . I was expecting a small cheeply made card , what I got was a well made , heavy card .  The heatsink on this looks like coper heatpipes and runs very cool at idle , in fact the fan is off at idle ! (cool ) I was suprised at the weight of the card this size . I bought this to run mass effect andromada and that is does , wow the eye candy is breathtakingI highly recomend this card the bang for the buck , build quality , and proformance are outstanding !!!","Cons:only one small con , the fan can get a little loud under load but is does the job very well if dead silent is what your after then this card is not for you","Other Thoughts:coming from a asus 950 to this wow ! I get even get better 2d quality , images look lke you could peel them off the screed"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Works Beautifully,2017-03-14,Pros:Built my computer about two weeks ago. I haven't had any issues with benchmarks yet. This is my first time building a computer and I'm not disappointed with the speed and quality this GPU puts out.,Cons:None as of yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Price to Performance,2017-03-10,Pros:Insanely fast for the price. Extremely compact for it's performance. Fit well into my case.,"Cons:Like others have mentioned, it can be extremely loud under load. My fan speeds were usually between 60% and 100% while running graphically extensive applications. This may have been due to case airflow limitations though.",Other Thoughts:Computer running this GPU:- i3 7100- Corsair 8GB DDR4 2400- EVGA 1060 SC 6GB [single fan]- EVGA 500W PSU- Silverstone SG13BDidn't dock an egg for audibility. Other [video] reviews mention it stays pretty quiet in cases with great airflow.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,great card,2017-02-19,Pros:I have a mini ITX motherboard and small form-factor case so the Heat output was a big issue for me. this card runs cooler then my old EVGA GTX 760 SC well on me to run Max settings I'm almost all games. can't recommend this card enough you won't be disappointed if your coming from an older card like I was.,Cons:the fan is loud if you run it up to the 4000 RPM Redline. that being said mine never goes above 50%,Other Thoughts:have the card for two weeks really happy with it
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Better Than I Expected,2017-02-19,"Pros:This card really is the king of 1080p gaming. Elite: Dangerous had been ranging between 24-60 fps with my old GTX 660 ti card and now runs a smooth 57-61 fps with the 1060 with most settings at Ultra and a few at High (VSync on). Card runs cool. The fan doesn't even activate until after about a half hour of playing Elite and then just barely. Haven't seen the temps go above 55 C under stock fan settings. Plays Elite, Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas effortlessly at max or near max settings at 60 fps.*UPDATE 2/19/17* Tried it with The Witcher 3 and that makes it run hotter, around 70-75 C with the fan going over 60%.","Cons:The only problem I had was that one of the two back panel screw holes didn't quite line up with the one in my case, but the other one did, so the card is locked down well enough. Just a minor irritation and could be my case's fault.","Other Thoughts:Smooth 1080p gaming, runs cool and quiet, what's not to love? If, like me, you were wondering if it was really worth it to upgrade from a 660 ti, go for it! It really does make a difference."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Great Card,2017-02-03,Pros:Great 1080p gaming,Cons:Does not turn on randomly after going into sleep mode while pressing key board or mouse; so have to hard turn off computer,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Yes, has no problem with 4k monitor.",2017-02-02,Pros:- It is really quiet...  almost as quiet as the fanless Nvidia 650 I had before I bought this.- Had 0 issues while installing the card.  Works perfectly after 5 days of use.,"Cons:- Performance improvement on games, over my old 650 card, is not noticeable except for ability run higher resolutions.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid upgrade,2017-01-30,"Pros:Best card I could fit in my stock HPHigh fps on multiple games, limited only by my monitorGreat value",Cons:If only a dual fan could be a little smaller,"Other Thoughts:Coming from a 750ti, this card is epic! Witcher 3 is very lush at 60 fps and doesn't drop below 50 fps on Ultra with mostly max settings in a fight."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Small But mighty.,2017-01-24,Pros:Normal EVGA quality without the stupid MLG/ROG/420 no-scope aesthetic. (if you know what I mean)Small- fits in almost all cases.Powerful- runs all modern titles at mostly high to ultra settings assuming 1080P resolution.Nvidia stability- never have driver issues on the green team.,Cons:Runs hot.Runs loud.,Other Thoughts:If space is not a problem then go with a full size card you will thank me.If you must go with a small card then you might want to under-clock this little guy for normal daily use as I find that it stayed hot even when under very little load.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Good Product!,2017-01-23,"Pros:-Easy to install, as would be expected.-Arrived quick and in a sturdy box, so it wasn't damaged at all.-Software was easy to install as well.-Runs most sorts of games buttery smooth, at least for me!-Easy fit for small towers.","Cons:-Not actually the card's fault, but EVGA's Precision tuner absolutely kills performance on really nonintensive products. Paint.NET refused to respond, but this was easily rectified by just shutting off the EVGA program.-My box did not come with instructions on install, which is fine if you've seen other people do this sort of thing, but could really turn off a newbie who honestly wants to get into this without fear of damaging these 200+ dollar components. I took an egg off just for this.","Other Thoughts:I recommend this product to people who have the money to get the 6GB model. The extra 50 bucks can be a bit of a pain, but the extra 3GB of VRAM certainly will help the card survive a lot longer with other models coming out.I would have really liked to know a good estimate for power supply usage as a whole, not just recommended for this card; Thankfully I already had one strong enough to pull the card's weight.All in all, I will most certainly be purchasing from EVGA again in the future."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,The best video card to get without spending a ton,2017-01-20,"Pros:Battlefield 1 - Ultra detail with max 1920x1080 resolution on ASUS 24"" 144hz monitor.  Runs like absolute butter with zero lag or drop in framesCan't believe the size of the card and the power it hasMuch less fan noise then my old dual fan cards",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:For the size, price, and performance you can't beat it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 6GB,2017-01-10,Pros:-Small for small towers-The better 1060 (This)-Doesn't get crazy hot.,Cons:-Not flashy,Other Thoughts:-Only get a 6gb 1060 model. It is way better
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 SC 6GB,2017-01-09,"Pros:Wonderful product with compact design, amazing if there's little room to work with in the case and still gives amazing near perfect performance at 1080p res.",Cons:None that I have.,"Other Thoughts:Amazing buy for 1080p gaming users, 4k users, its good, but maybe something else is better."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good option for a budget 1440p experience.,2017-01-09,Pros:- EVGA quality.- Small size makes makes this an ideal upgrade for micro ATX builds and for cases with limited space.- Desirable frame rates and detail settings are achievable for 1440p gaming.- Relatively low power consumption.,Cons:- SLI is not an option.- DVI screws always come off when I unhook my monitor. (the screws unscrew along with the dvi),Other Thoughts:- 1440p gaming was achieved usingGTX 1060Intel Core i7 26003x4GB DDR37200 RPM 500GB HDD430 Watt PSUQNIX QX2710
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent Product,2017-01-01,Pros:-Excellent cooling capability-High factory overclock speed-Compact design,Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:-Comes with a nice factory overclock, so not a lot of manual overclocking here; locked voltage."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,1st gpu and very satisfied,2016-12-27,"Pros:This is the first gpu I've ever purchased that went in the first gaming level PC I've ever owned. I say this because I don't have anything to really compare it to.I can say that this card was the perfect choice for me. I needed a shorter card, and this one has the absolute best power to size ratio on the market right now.So far it runs ice cold and silent running 1080p max settings at least 60fps on GTA 5, Skyrim, ds3, steep, etc. 250+ on cs:go. I say at least 60fps because my monitor is an LG IPS 75hz, I just keep it in 60 with vsync on, because that alone is a monumental step up from even my ps4 pro. with vsync off, I get ~100+ fps on GTA 5 max settings 1080p.Did I mention silent and ice cold? truly",Cons:n/a,"Other Thoughts:I think it's too bad they didn't leave an option for SLI with the 1060 and down, but 1 is all I need anyway"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,"Small, Power Efficient, and Powerful!",2016-12-13,"Pros:• Packs a huge performance punch in a much smaller size than other GTX 1060's.• Even though it has a smaller heatsink and only a single fan, it still cools almost as well as other GTX 1060's.","Cons:Originally the card shipped with the 0 dB BIOS, which did not have that aggressive of a fan curve and made the card hot on idle and regularly reach 80°C under load. For some reason this BIOS is also incompatible with nouveau, and it was not possible to boot into Ubuntu 16.04 or 16.10 without using my integrated graphics to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. EVGA a few months later then rolled out BIOS version 86.06.27.01.60, which solved all of these issues. The fan idles at around 20% speed now, but is not audible at all.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Simply great.,2016-12-06,"Pros:This is my first computer build, and I am so lucky to have built a computer in this time in technology. I have never tried any other graphics cards, so I can't necessarily compare with anything. All I can say is it's power is matching with the previous generations top dogs for $200 less. If you're coming from a 960 or a 970, you might be surprised with the difference (970 not so much, but you have the extra 2.5GB of VRAM to work with, so I'm not sure).",Cons:None thus far.,"Other Thoughts:It does tend to run hot while gaming without your own fan curve, but I would assume that most do. MSI Afterburner solved that problem, not to mention that I get to view all of my systems temperatures and usages alongside keeping my GPU cool. EVGA Precision XOC can also solve this problem, but you can't view all of your systems temperatures and usages with it, only your GPUs."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Performance and a great upgrade in my case.,2016-11-28,"Pros:- Compact design ensures compatibility with most if not all form factor cases. (Used mine in Corsair 230t)- Low Fan Noise- Great Upgrade from a GTX 960, if you have a 960 or below (950, 760 ect) there is a great performance leap that is worth the upgrade.-Sits comfortably between a 970 and 980 in terms of performance",Cons:- None so far,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,A dreamboat!,2016-11-25,"Pros:Fast, quiet, compact!  It makes my system run a lot quieter and also runs noticeably cooler.  Handles all my gaming very smoothly.  I upgraded from an old GTX 480.  Very glad I did, while my old card served me well, this was a great replacement for it.",Cons:I don't get to use it more than I do now!,"Other Thoughts:(nothing to do with the card) I to flash my MB and update it and tinker with it quite a bit to get it to recognize the card.  Once I did, it was smooth sailing for a couple of months now."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,None,2016-11-24,Pros:grate love it end of story,Cons:none,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING,2016-11-19,Pros:-More impressive performance leap from the 960 to 1060 than the 760 to 960 was.-Small size-Decent cooler/pipe array and  fan setup.,"Cons:-Fluctuating prices and availability.-Questionable Nvidia driver quality.-For a 1080p card, it's a little overkill. For 1440p, it's average.-No back plate.-","Other Thoughts:Great card. But for 1080p, you can go cheaper."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Fantastic Graphics Card for the Price,2016-11-14,"Pros:I bought this card before the holiday price spike (around $250). It runs fantastic, I've run Fallout 4/Skyrim Remastered/Payday 2/EU 4/CSGO all on max settings and this card doesn't break a sweat. FPS stays above 60fps, usually much higher since I only use 1080p (normal is around 90-100), and I haven't seen it rise above 60 degrees Celsius even under full load for several hours. It is also very quiet, I never hear the fan. The configuration software provided by EVGA allows me to overclock and set gpu AI no problem.",Cons:None really.,"Other Thoughts:During the holidays the demand (and price) for this card increases exponentially, as one would expect. I would hold out until you find it offered online at a decent price."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Very efficient, High value, Small form",2016-11-04,Pros:Runs very quietRarely hear it at allLow power consumptionRuns stable at hotter temps,"Cons:Not as powerful as it's 1070 sister. (of course, not as expensive either)","Other Thoughts:I would highly recommend this card to people who are upgrading stock cases. It will fit in just about any mid tower I have seen. The thing is tiny in comparison to many other cards I have had. I have seen some people worrying about it's high operating temp, but honestly I think that is just its stable temp range. 5 eggs. Lots of goodies in the box as well."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Good card,2016-11-04,Pros:Max out 1080P gaming great card,Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:6.8 inches, that's what she said."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,More than enough for me,2016-10-31,"Pros:Small form factor, a lot of power, its fan is off all the time unless I'm playing a very graphics intensive game, which I rarely do.",Cons:I don't play enough graphics intensive games to justify such a nice card!,"Other Thoughts:I put it in a Raijintek Metis case. Fits perfectly, although I did put a blow hole in the top to help deal with it running slightly hotter than I wanted. (High 70 C to low 80 C when playing No Man's Sky.)"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Product. Works as advertise,2016-10-31,Pros:-Price-Performs extremely well-Ease to overclock-Perfect for 1080p gaming-Runs quiet  even under full load,Cons:-None so far and I  have been running for several hours everyday while gaming since I got it and no hiccups of any kind.,Other Thoughts:-Would recommend to anyone looking for a very good card at a even better price.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing FPS,2016-10-29,Pros:Replaced a hd6950 with this thing in my lga775 maximus 2 formula and I'm now playing the newest games with maxed settings at 60+ fps.-small form factor-good value,Cons:none expected,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent performance for 1080p gaming,2016-10-28,"Pros:-Great value if you can find the card in stock at close to MSRP.-Performance is pretty much flawless at 1080p-Very power efficient, which is the main reason I chose this over the RX 480. My 400 W (high quality) power supply works fine with this card. The card only needs one 6-pin power connector.-The fan is quiet.-Idle power draw seems to be very low. I noticed that the fan doesn't even turn on at idle.",Cons:Frequently priced substantially above MSRP.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING,2016-10-23,"Pros:Small in Size only 1 6 pin needed, Runs Cool",Cons:Drivers from Nvidia are unstable after hours trying to figure out if it was my monitor or the video card and trying 2 other monitors and installing multiple drivers all attempts failed. I should have waited for at least 6 months or longer till Nvidia would get the drivers ironed out,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Easy to install , easy to overclock ...  must buy for high performance at a low budjet",2016-10-23,Pros:SmallEasily Overclockable (Check jayztwocents overclocking video )VR ready,Cons:-no backplate,Other Thoughts:I replaced my old 680 2GB with this 1060 GB.I run Doom Division in ultra at 1080 at 60 fpsThe 6gb memory is good for texturing software such as Substance painter 2 when you start to have a lots of layers ..I'm not disappointed

Fry Cry 3 / 4, DOOM, etc.  Fallout 4 gets 60 FPS on ultra except for Diamond City.This thing does protein folding six times better than the old card (PPD now ~360,000):  Hits no higher than 74C folding and less than that while gaming.Boost clock goes up to 1960 MHz, but your results may vary.",Cons:Remember to take that stupid protective film off of the case.,Other Thoughts:Remember to a complete uninstall of your video drivers and install the latest driver from nvidia
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid.,2016-10-11,Pros:The best value GPU on the market (generally speaking).,Cons:None.,"Other Thoughts:I put this in a machine with a Skylake Pentium, and it can run World of Warcraft at maximum settings. So for about $300 you have yourself max WoW graphics."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Plug and play,2016-10-11,Pros:Purchased this for 1080p gaming and haven't been disappointed. Size of unit permits for unobstructed airflow within my Nano S case.  Using MSI Afterburner for tweaking GPU. Great experience. Idle @ 25c  Load @ 68c with aggressive setting.  EVGA BIOS upgrade available for semi-passive fan use.  No coil noise.,"Cons:Lack of SLI, LED or backplate.",Other Thoughts:Great bang for your buck.  Solid engineering and performance.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Value for the Price,2016-10-10,"Pros:- Awesome Value in this tiny card.  Mine came with the 0db fan bios, so was a simple driver download from the website, and i was up and running.   Plays all my games at 60fps, and they look amazing now!- Small size and only needs 1 6pin from the power supply has also cleaned up my case and increased air flow!- Stays cool using the default fan profile.  Have not felt the need to use a custom fan curve yet.",Cons:No Cons here.,Other Thoughts:Replaces a 4 year old HD7870 that decided to fail.  Could not be happier with this choice.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,awesome card,2016-10-08,Pros:-fast graphic rating when i bench marked it-super quiet fan at full speed-doesnt overheat very easily highest so far has been 48c-supports 4k i have it hooked up to my 55 inch screen tv and picture look great during game play- small form factor helps for better air flow in case-over clocking works great on it got my clock up to 2138 mhz and stayed stable and got memory clock up to 4666,Cons:- none so far only problem i had was with my skyrims enb not working but that was remedy by enboost though-no sli bridge which suck would deff like to buy another one to hook up together,"Other Thoughts:great card , great price would highly recommend to anybody awesome preformance"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Excellent card for LAN Rigs/small form factor PC builds,2016-10-08,Pros:- Card size will fit in most small form factor cases that accept full size riser cards.- EVGA great grapic card company that has wonderful support.- GTX1060 benchmarks..go look them up! This card will be standard in all my friends low budget PC builds,Cons:- No SLI support :(- No shiny LED lights,"Other Thoughts:Hey....stop reading reviews...put this into your cart, head over to EVGA to look at benchmarks, put your wallet up to the screen, and give them your money! This card is amazing. I plan on recommending this card to anyone who has a small form factor PC build, travels to LANs, goes to QuakeCon, takes their shirt off while gaming, drinks too much Jack Daniels. Really. you need a new video card your Voodoo2 just isn't cutting it anymore. It's time to upgrade! DO IT! DON'T LET YOUR DREAMS BE DREAMS!!!!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Wow nice card,2016-10-07,"Pros:EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING, played all  online games  at max 1080p res with great fps.Small card fit perfect into my  small case.",Cons:None,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very easy to install and a great upgrade to GTX 750 Ti,2016-10-07,Pros:The size of the card takes up very little space in my system case and the power requirements are well suited to both general and gaming requirements.,"Cons:None yet, but I'll keep looking.","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card to anyone who is considering the jump to the GeForce 10 series cards.  While it may not have all the specs that a seriously hardcore gamer wants, this card is very well suited to the other 95% of the gamers out there!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,GTX 1060 SC Gaming (SF),2016-10-07,"Pros:- Runs very cool in a mini ITX case (even with just one fan)- Low noise.- More than enough horsepower for 1080 HD (really...1080 HD is hi def enough for most of us mortals)- Will run most any new title at max or near max settings. (leaps and bounds ahead of cards from a few years ago)- Only needs one six pin for power.- Quality as expected from EVGA!- No LED's or excess junk.- Optional software to control fans.- Can be overclocked further (but why bother?)- Affordable and includes a case badge, some stickers and poster.","Cons:- Really none as far as I can see, does what it says on the tin and then some.","Other Thoughts:Bought this to replace a 3 year old GTX 760, it was a great card...got the 1060 for about the same price and it's far better, should future proof my gaming for a few years. Of course I use a 1920x1080 LED HD monitor so it runs that smooth as butter if you are into 2k or more then you should probably move up to a 1070, but for 1080 HD this 1060 is the bomb.Be sure to get the SC Gaming model the cheaper version has a cheesy heatsink and the SC is already OC'd.Been playing Fallout 4 on Ultra with tons of texture mods and runs at 60 FPS with only a few drops in FPS when the action gets busy or there is a lot of foliage around, runs Elite Dangerous Horizons maxed out as well, also used on a few smaller indie games like Fishing Planet and I can't even tell it's running.All in all this card should serve most normal 1080 HD PC gamers very well and in the last 10 years I've had zero issues with any EVGA cards I've used...very high quality. When I upgrade again in a few years (or up to a 1070) I will choose EVGA and Newegg!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,Doing something wrong?,2016-10-05,Pros:Overall I guess it was a good buy. easy to setup and is still fast however...,Cons:I can't seem to run GTA 5 in atleast High settings at 60fps. Other games like the Division and Battlefront work perfectly and smooth so maybe it's just GTA is poorly optimized. I would've expected the 1060 to be able to run gta in ultra but it doesn't that way which is why i'm also unsure of how other youtube videos playing gta 5 in ultra are able to run it consistently. I'm even using Precision XOC and that still isn't helping either.,Other Thoughts:I was originally using an r9 380 but there doesn't seem to be a huge difference between the two cards. how long until this card becomes obsolete?
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Best ""Sweet spot"" card I've ever seen. Best current 1060 to buy.",2016-09-30,"Pros:As the title says, this is the best ""sweet spot"" card I've seen. The previous generation card in the ""sweet spot"" was the GTX 970, which came in at $400 and was actually a pretty good deal. This however blows that deal out of the water. This kind of performance (any game on the planet at 1080p, ultra graphics, at a constant 60fps) is simply unbelievable to me at this price pint, which is currently $259.Add to that the size of this card, which is probably 2/3 to half the size of many current cards. I LOVE this. Makes it so easy to use in almost any build.QUIET! I can barely hear this thing running (probably due to the single fan) while playing games.In a nutshell, this is the best performing card per dollar on the market. And this particular one (EVGA 6gb) is the best value among them.",Cons:None. Works perfectly out of the box at low temps and with super quiet operation.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Solid Card,2016-09-26,"Pros:Small, powerful, affordable, runs cool, overclocks well, good value and highly rated. I would recommend this to anyone who games at 1080p.",Cons:I might have a problem with low minimum framerates when overclocking as I noticed a trend where the higher I overclocked the higher the average fps would go but the minimum fps would actually lower. Could be a problem for some people but yet to be a problem for me playing The Witcher 3.,Other Thoughts:Using EVGA Precision X OC I got an overclock of +150MHz on the GPU and +500MHz on the memory. My Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 score is 1845 with an average framerate of 73.3 and runs at 70 degrees C after 20 minutes in Furmark. I haven't ran it overnight yet so we'll see if the overclock can survive an 8hr stress test.EDIT: turns out +150MHz is a little too much for The Witcher 3 to run stably but +90 works well.. At max settings with Hairworks I average in the low 50 fps with dips down to 40 at times but definitely still playable and enjoyable visually. Also using Precision X OC I had to increase the voltage bar on the left to 50% just fyi.One thing that bugged me was my custom Fan map didn't apply properly in Precision X OC so I had to run it in Aggressive mode instead. Not a huge deal and could just be me but it was something.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Powerful.,2016-09-15,"Pros:I think I heard the card laugh, when I requested Skyrim maxed out.  It offered it up in 2K.  GTA V is maxed out at 1080p.  There may be frame rate dips, but I didn't notice.  I haven't officially measured anything.  I haven't overclocked or utilized the boost feature.  The card is a beast!",Cons:None.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Eveything is perfect except......,2016-09-13,Pros:-Small form factor for the same specs as a double fan graphics card.-easy to setup-Benchmark and stress test are incredible-Really great product overall,Cons:-Normally a graphics card will come with an adapter for the DVI and VGA. This card only come with the power adapter (For old power supply). So be aware !,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,No Man’s Sky? No Problems!,2016-09-13,Pros:-Price to Performance Ratio-Small Form Factor,Cons:-None,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from an EVGA GTX 970 SSC ACX 2.0. Although the 970 is more than capable of running most games (GTA5, Skyrim, ARMA 3, etc) at high settings with 40 to +60fps (1080p), I had to give in to the hype of the 1060. At the price point Newegg was offering the card, I had to get one for myself.After receiving the card, I installed it along with the 1060's driver and 10 series specific EVGA Precision OC software. I also installed the 0db Fan Stop BIOS (the factory BIOS will have the fan running at 45%, minimum). I ran it at factory clock on Unigine Extreme settings (3 times) and got an average score of 2133.In my ITX case (specs below), I was getting temps up to 82C on the card, max, on each of the run, with the base curve. After fiddling with a custom curve, I was able to have the fan operate at a tolerable noise level and keeping the temperature at under 75C.Gaming-wise, the temps run slightly lower than the benchmarking temps, between 60-70C, depending on the instance in the game. I can run GTA5 maxed out @ +60fps. On No Man's Sky, with this card an my other specs, I get +60fps on the highest settings at 1080p, at all instances with no crashes (as reported by many people). Every now and then I'd get a few dips in fps but it most likely the game and not the GPU. This card is No Man's Sky friendly!If you're looking to upgrade and on a tight budget, don't settle for anything in the 900 series. This card cost less and performs just as well as the highest 900 series. I highly recommend this card!Specs:Case: Thermaltake Core V1CPU: i5 6600KMobo: GIGABYTE GA-H170N-WIFIRAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 8GB (4Gx2)OS: Windows 10GPU: EVGA 1060 SC ACX 2.0 Single FanPSU: CX750MCPU Cooler: LEPA AquaChanger 120"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great 1080p card at a good price!,2016-09-10,"Pros:- Easy to install- Cooling is amazing, even with only 1 fan- Looks good (if this kind of thing matters to you)- Fits into almost any case, which is perfect for Micro ATX/Mini ITX builds- Requires only a single 6-pin for additional power- And most importantly, it performs like a beast! Coming from a GTX 950 is like night and day!- Bonus: I got some cool in-game stuff for Paragon, which is nice since I really enjoy the game :)","Cons:- Nothing really, other than I had to wait about a week to finally catch it in stock :)",Other Thoughts:Perfect budget card for 1080p (and maybe even 1440p) if you can find it at MSRP!
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge Upgrade,2016-09-09,Pros:FastMore RAM than I will ever need,"Cons:The ports don't match up very well with the back of my case,  limiting me to using the DVI port at this time. That is more my problem than the card I guess.","Other Thoughts:I went from a Radeon 5670 (it died) to this and WOW talk about night and day.  With the 5670 the best I could do was Medium graphics settings.  Now with the 1060 I am running max settings on the games I play (iRacing and ETS2).  If you can't afford or don't want to spend $200-$400 more (like me) on a 1070 or 1080,  this is a great card for the money!CPU-FX-4300 OC'd @4.1 GHzCPU cooler- Corsair H70MB- ASUS M5A97 LE R2.0RAM- Corsair Vengeance 8GB DDR3 1866PSU- 550 Watt"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"easy to install, super fast",2016-09-08,"Pros:doesnt heat up, shorter length means more cooling, and more space, bang for the buck video card.",Cons:none so far,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Huge upgrade from a GTX 760 at a ridiculously low price!,2016-09-07,Pros:Fits easily in mid sized case. Running new games on ultra quite easily. The single fan keeps temps well in cool range on heavy loads (Witcher 3 maxed including Hairworks) and is very quiet. A no brainer upgrade on a budget.,"Cons:Just wish this had LEDs, but that is just flavor :)",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Love it,2016-09-07,"Pros:Quiet, small, powerful",Cons:None,Other Thoughts:Perfect for my HTPC. Upscales 1080 and lower content to 4K with ease using pretty aggressive MadVR settings. Really fits the bill.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fantastic upgrade, great price/performance",2016-09-07,Pros:- Cheap and effective-Runs at 65 C max in my set up- almost 3x better than my r7 260x- Low power draw-Small,Cons:-Literally none. I have had no issues.,Other Thoughts:I would recommend this to anyone in the 250-300 dollar price range that can't afford to move up to a 1070 or Fury X.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice card for 1080P,2016-09-07,Pros:6GB of ram.. enough to run 4k if you wantNice upgrade path for the priceCard runs cool and quiet,Cons:Would have been nice for 2 fans. But 1 seems to do the job okLack of SLI in the 1060,"Other Thoughts:I run the Witcher 3 and some other AAA titles with max detail at 1080p with this card at a very good frame rate.Nice upgrade for me coming from an EVGA GTX 670card runs at 35c puttering around in windows, and 65c while gaming with the fan at 70%"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Easy overclocking, works great",2016-09-07,Pros:Easy install in my Phanteks p400 case and MSI z-170 pro motherboard.  Overclocking software is as easy or in depth as you want (I'm brand new to PC gaming). Was able to get great performance on Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (1440p 60fps after overclocking with very high settings).,Cons:None so far,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Love the card!,2016-09-07,"Pros:This was a major upgrade from my old 750 card. All games are running smoothly (FHD). With the new firmware the card is silent when non intensive GPU work is done. I have a small case, but the temperature of the card never exceeded 78 C. The fan was not too noisy either.",Cons:Nothing really.,"Other Thoughts:Great card, small, quiet. I like the fact that there are no LEDs on it."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great Card,2016-09-07,Pros:Wanted to upgrade my 660 Ti and this was in about the same price range as the 660 Ti was when I got it.  Love the performance and the size is a nice plus.  Painless upgrade.,Cons:No real complaints.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Great performance card at a good price, runs cool and quiet",2016-09-07,"Pros:-Great performance - I've been playing BF1 beta, Crysis, etc at 1080p with Ultra-high/maxed out settings with vertical sync on, and it keeps framerates at a consistent 60 fps with little to no fps drop.-Small form factor allows it to fit in smaller cases.-Cool and quiet (maxes out at 70'C during gaming, and the fan turns off during idle with the new EVGA bios)-Cheaper compared to other OCed GTX1060s (MSRP at $260)-Factory overclocked out of the box",Cons:-No backplate (it'd be nicer looking since others in this price range have backplates)-No SLi (none of the 1060s have this ability),Other Thoughts:Great product at a great price

This little GTX1060sc is exceptional for the size, totally outscores my GTX970 in every benchmark I put it through. It's an EVGA... Who else could pull this off? dollar for dollar the best graphics card for the money there is. If you can get your hands on this I definitely would recommend you stop looking and buy this one.","Cons:I can't find one, when you do let me know.","Other Thoughts:Totally Recommend, Yes I would buy it again and yes I would recommend it to a friend."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,None,2016-09-07,"Pros:Everything, from the card itself to the support from EVGA, is amazing. The card was the perfect addition to my new system and makes game playing look amazing.",Cons:There are no cons. I really can't think of anything I don't like.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card for the money,2016-09-07,Pros:-This card is less expensive than almost every 1060 but performs just as well if not better-Runs cool-Lower power usage-Zero Fanspeed mode-Quiet-Only $10 more than nonSC version (better heatsink)-Max out any game at 1080p-Good warranty,Cons:Need to get a 1070 to max out some titles at 1440p,Other Thoughts:I believe this is the best 1060 value you can get and most certainly the best card for around $250
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,BEST GPU for 1080p 144hz gaming,2016-09-05,"Pros:-35C idle temperature (I have 6 fans in my case: 2 front, 2 top, 2 back)-45C load temperature (pretty good)-I get 130fps in GTA 5 on maxed out settings (85 fps if I put distance to max in advance settings)-I get 95+fps in Battlefield 1 Beta on ultra settings-Affordable card, I bought it for $256.78 (including tax)",Cons:-None at the moment (I have been using this card for more than a month now),"Other Thoughts:This is better than the GTX 1070 because if you look at benchmarks, the 1070 will have around 20fps more than the 1060. $200 more for 20fps more is not worth it in my opinion. Stick with this card to save money and have good results."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Nice,2016-09-05,"Pros:Everything I need for gaming @ 1080, mighty quiet unless pushed to the limit, small form-factor, sips power like a lady, looks mighty good in a small case build.","Cons:Sad that it cannot be SLI`ed, but oh well.","Other Thoughts:If I could justify the price of a 1070 for the amount of gaming I do, or the resolution I use (1080) then I would have bought one. But for me this works just fine, out benchmarks the 970, and should be all I need for a while. The 6 GB RAM is excellent as well, and should serve me for a long time.For anyone doing an mATX/miniITX build that wants the most performance in the smallest size, you do not need to look any further. The only way to beat this is by water cooling a higher priced card, so if you are debating the cost or size just stop now and hit the Ad to Cart button. Unless you are waiting for it to be back in stock, then keep waiting, it`s worth every penny."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,2.0GHz Right Out of the Box! And for only $260! WHAT IS THIS MADNESS!?!,2016-09-02,Pros:- This card went right to 1960MHz when I got it up and running and peaked under load (naturally) at 2000MHz- Full load I can barely hear the fan over the case fans that I have- At Full load it usually is about 60-65 C (I have never seen this card achieve a temp over 65 C. EVER!),"Cons:Not really cons, but:- No backplate (Would be cool, but unnecessary due to the small size)- No LEDs (Again, totally unnecessary. But a light up EVGA logo like the 1070's would be pretty sweet)","Other Thoughts:I would definitely recommend this card. I can play all games maxed out at 60+ fps (Except for the cpu intensive ones due to a cpu bottleneck). Unless you want to try to OC this to its absolute max, your temps should stay below 70 C (even under load). Due to my cpu bottleneck, I have not had the opportunity to give this card a run for the money, but all things considered, BEST VALUE CARD!!! (Purchased it when it was $260) First time buying EVGA and I think I might stick with them from now on! Great product quality and a 3 year warranty."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great CUDA card for Premiere Pro,2016-09-01,Pros:Wonderful GPU acceleration for Adobe Premiere Pro video editing.  Great Bang-For=Buck performance and easy Memory Overclocking,Cons:None so far,Other Thoughts:So satisfied I just bought a second one   In testing with Premiere Pro BenchMark it is just as fast as my GTX 780Ti for GPU acceleration.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Excellent card, small and keeps cool.",2016-08-29,Pros:-Runs cool-Somewhat quiet at high RPM's-Good overclocking-Small,"Cons:LED's would've been cool, I'm not an LED everything kind of person, but a glow would've been neat.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,None,2016-08-24,"Pros:Good card, small fast, and quiet when running.","Cons:When I put my PC to sleep and wake up, the GPU fan will make big noise to full speed and then slow down. It is annoying. Not sure it is common or not.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Performs without issue.,2016-08-22,"Pros:Easy installation, smaller physical size, single quiet fan even under load.  The GTX 1060 performs very well for its price.","Cons:None.  6GB RAM is overkill for 1080p/1200p resolution but I'll probably get a 2560x1080 monitor soon and it will help with that, I suppose.","Other Thoughts:One of the other reviews for this product complains of high temperatures due to it having only one fan.  That has not been my experience.  This GPU plays DOOM at 1920x1200 resolution on Ultra at > 60fps without issue.  After an hour of game play, the card remains quiet with a temperature of  40C over ambient.  In my 22C/72F office, that's 62C/144F.  Those temperatures are well within tolerable limits."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,2,"Excellent performance, but why are my temperatures so high at full load?",2016-08-22,"Pros:Great graphics and framerate, yatta yatta... you've heard it all before -- it's as good as everyone has suggested. I upgraded from a GTX 760 and this is certainly a satisfactory upgrade. I played Dragon Age 3 for the first time comfortably with everything ULTRA /w fade-touched textures and 2x MSAA WITH VSync and things went great at a stable 50-60FPS. Dips down to the mid-40's with really intense scenes but extremely rare. I was very satisfied with the performance. Anyone who's played DA3 knows the environments are MASSIVE so to see it breeze through such scenes was exciting.","Cons:However...The single-fan design didn't seem to do as much for temps as others claimed it did. I'm not sure if it's a quality control issue like some have suggested, or that this is actually normal and some of these buyers were testing in arctic environments, but when at full load on Dragon Age 3, I was getting upwards of 87 Celsius, sometimes hitting 89 C after just a couple minutes. Bear in mind this was with a MAXIMUM efficiency airflow setup in a NZXT S340 case.Strangely, there were no adverse graphical effects, which leaves me no doubt that the card can handle the temperatures, but I simply didn't feel comfortable gaming for hours with it.  The temperatures scared me, so I turned VSync on for the framerate limit, which again, stays roughly around 60FPS. That way the GPU rarely goes to 100% utilization and temps stay around 60-70 C which is still a bit high, but not as insane as what I was witnessing before I did this. I also removed the front panel of the S340 so the fans could deal with the heat better as I could literally feel the OUTSIDE of my case become hot at those temperatures, which is kinda nuts.I absolutely did not feel comfortable leaving it at full load at those temperatures for hours.**COOLING CONFIG**NZXT S340 CASE:- 2x Corsair AF140's PULLING air at the FRONT- 1x Corsair SP140 PUSHING air out at the TOP- 1x Corsair AF120 PUSHING air out at the BACKAMBIENT AIR: ~80 F (Summer in NYC)OTHER POTENTIALLY RELEVANT FACTORS: Asus 970 Aura Motherboard, AMD FX8350, Super neat cable management and dust-free and impediment-free airflow (wish I could provide pictures -- grr Newegg).---NOTE: My CPU temperatures with this fan setup have been FANTASTIC, yet somehow this GPU's temps are reaching nearly 90C at full load... HOW??","Other Thoughts:If I could do it again, I probably would have spent a little extra money on a card with better fan/heatsink design. I might actually return this if I can manage to grab the Zotac design at a decent price. I had to remove the front panel on my case to deal with all the additional heat...ugly.I dunno, maybe I got a dud, I don't want to bag on EVGA, but it's my first time going with them (always been a fan of Gigabyte and Windforce) and I'm a little disappointed. I suppose it's not all bad considering it's not actually negatively affecting anything graphically as of yet, but these temps can't be safe."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,The best deal Nvidia has offered all year,2016-08-19,"Pros:- Amazing refresh rates- Excellent price point (paid $260)- This card should fit most PC cases (excluding micro cases)- Super easy to install with PCI-e power cable included- Huge improvement over my 970Ti- Super quite fan, even in an aluminum case",Cons:-Does not support SLI but comes with instructions on how to install up to 4 in SLI mode.   Cruel...very cruel.Does not include any drivers for offline installation.  Even though they would be out of date basic drivers should be included since Nvidia driver pack is currently over 450mb download.  For offline users or worse (DSL users) this is a non-starter.,Other Thoughts:Since I was upgrading from an Nvidia 960Ti card I simply updated the drivers and then shutdown and did a card swap.  Super easy.  Within 15 minutes I easily doubled my FPS.If you are a gamer looking to upgrade this card is worth serious consideration.  If you are running your PC on your large LED screen at 1080p like me then the 1070 and 1080 models are overkill.I'm so impressed with this card I am already shopping for a new gaming laptop with the integrated 1060 chip.This is my third EVGA made card.  All cards have been excellent.  Overclocking tools and monitoring software is first rate.  Manufacturing build quality is excellent.  Even under heavy load never had a heat spike.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Perfect for my needs,2016-08-18,Pros:- Fast- Great value- Zero RPM fan mode,Cons:- Need to download BIOS update,"Other Thoughts:I'm a teacher, and I installed this in my older Dell Optiplex 790 minitower in my classroom. The motherboard only supplies 35W through the PCI Express slot so I was worried that even with an upgraded power supply it would not work. I replaced the stock power supply with an EVGA 600 B1 to provide the needed 6-pin power connector for the card. Once installed, it started right up without any problems.I downloaded the new Zero RPM BIOS and now the card is silent when running less stressful tasks. Even when I start Garry's Mod, Minecraft, or Autodesk Inventor the card is never loud. I'm very happy to give new life to my older computer."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, quiet, easy setup",2016-08-16,"Pros:Runs Doom and Dying Light on maximum setting at 1080p with no issues.  I've seen it run as hot as 70C, but it's never loud.Ppl complain about no backplates on certain models like this one.  Graphics card looks don't matter much to me, but for what it's worth, It's the nicest looking card I've ever owned.The 9cm fan is a larger/quieter than the 8cm fans on my old card.",Cons:One fan instead of two may impede OC.  I haven't bothered overclocking this yet because there would be no noticeable performance change.,"Other Thoughts:I would have been happy with a 4GB RX 480 at $200, but I found this in stock first.  It is a little bit better product than an RX 480 4GB and 8GB and it's a little more expensive.  If you're thinking of spending around $250, I'd recommend this over the RX 480."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2016-08-16,"Pros:- It's small, gives more airflow in my mid tower.- It boosted to 2000, and I took it bit further to 2100-2200 with precision software.- Never goes above 65 in temp.- Ran all UHD benchmarks at 60 FPS or better","Cons:-Nothing, it took me a while to catch it in stock.",Other Thoughts:I'd recommend this to anyone gaming at 1080p.
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,None,2016-08-13,"Pros:Silent and fast!  I am so used to my PC being crazy loud with all the cpu and gpu fans and this is much welcome.Destroyed everything I throw at it on ultra settings.  I only have a 1080p display, but that's precisely what I was looking for and it delivered .Make sure to snap one up - I saw this was in stock and had to immediately buy.","Cons:When comparing to the rx 480, this has no multi-card connectivity for future proofing.Still, I am really happy with all that I have seen so far from this card.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"yeah, this is the 1080p card to have",2016-08-12,"Pros:Cost, power efficiency, small size, quiet, cool, 1080p >60fps ultra everything. literally twice the average fps of my evga 770.fast sync is also fantastic for quicker high framerate games.",Cons:no backplate? idk it has no cons XD,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Excellent, small size, high performance GPU",2016-08-11,"Pros:Size: Perfect for my new mITX build. Had a GTX 980 In there, had to cut the case and squeeze that sucker in. The 1060 sc, however, is so small installation was a breeze, with tons of room to spare.Power: Low power consumption compared to my GTX 980 for comparable performance output.Noise: hardly audible during gameplay, unless you're making it your job to listen for it. Impressive regardless, especially for a single fan unit that cools as well as a dual fan unit.Cooling: Low steady temps. This thing runs at 61 degrees Celsius for the entirety of my gaming sessions on ultra graphics at 1440p.  It is excellent, especially given it's small size and single fan.","Cons:Looks: Has the same look as older gen EVGA GPU's in the ""mini sc"" model line, such as the GTX 750 sc. Not so much a con, as it looks pretty nice, but if we are nit picking for the sake of it, the lack of style upgrade from previous gen model is basically the only thing I could come up with.No SLI: Not so much a con of this specific card, but more of the new gen GPU line from NVIDIA. As an enthusiast I love SLI'ing cards and other unnecessary PC mods, and I'm a little bummed out I'll never be able to do it with new gen GPU's.","Other Thoughts:If you need a card that will perform excellently on demanding games on high graphics and at high resolution  and in a small form factor to fit into tight spaces do not hesitate for even a moment. This bad boy sells out FAST. Don't settle for a similar mini, like the one from ZOTAC, as for essentially the same price this model is superclocked and higher clock speeds."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,AMAZING CARD!,2016-08-10,"Pros:This EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING is a great card for the price!Powerful, small and quiet.Very happy with this purchase.I was worried mine will come with a coil whine or noisy fan like others have experienced. But no, very silent card.",Cons:Nothing really for the price,"Other Thoughts:When I first plugged it in my PC wouldn't post, just froze up. To get around that, i needed to reset my bios with clear cmos button, and all worked after that. Also the EVGA PercisionX OC software is very useful, give you much control over the card. You can tune the fan speed down or up. I have mine set to 0dB up to 40 degrees C."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great purchase!,2016-08-10,"Pros:- The size of this thing is great, very compact. Huge reduction in size switching from an r9 390x.- Powerful, this card is really great and around the same performance of the 390x I had, but even better in some games. Fps also seems a lot more consistent and I am not having any huge dips as I did with my other card. I am getting amazing performance in all games very high to ultra/max settings in 1440p.- I don't know what some of the reviewers are talking about on the other listing for the non SC, this thing runs very cool. It has never gotten past the 60s on full load and some games I'm not even breaking 50 C. This card runs super cool especially with a single cooling fan. And I'm switching from an AMD card, my case actually blows out cold air now :)","Cons:- Wish it had SLI support, but that would be overkill and would probly outperform 1070s maybe a 1080 for cheaper?","Other Thoughts:- This is a great card especially for the price, I would def recommend it.- The performance, size, and low temperature of this card is amazing for the price point."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,3,"Great card, really annoying fan.",2016-08-10,"Pros:Runs Witcher 3 close to max settings (foliage ""High"" and Hairworks ""Off"") at 1080p with near constant 60fps. Should set one for 1080p gaming for years to come!","Cons:The fan ""clicks"" and is audible during more silent parts of gameplay. Completely unexpected of a new product and obtrusive enough to warrant the low rating. Also does not run as cool as expected, but at least has yet to peak over 85C at 50% fan.","Other Thoughts:Review updated to reflect impressions after the card has been put through its paces. Simply put, the EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC is a beast of a card marred by the lottery pick of a lemon fan."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing!,2016-08-09,Pros:- Fits perfectly on my mAtx case- Is always silent even while heavy gaming- Delivers pure 1080p on maxed settings on every game I throw at it- The compact design is a plus- Easy to install,Cons:- None so far,"Other Thoughts:When it comes to Evga products, you can't go wrong because of their power usage and sleek design. Overall, I am very satisfied with this card since I will be mainly be gaming on 1080p due to my monitor. I would definitely recommend this card!"
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great so far,2016-08-09,"Pros:Installed without a hitch.  Performance, size, power consumption all miles better than the failing 5870 it replaced.  Should handle whatever I throw at it 1080p good settings for the foreseeable future.",Cons:None yet.,None

BF4 is ALL ULTRA and average like 115 frames. it's so great-fan is quiet-new bios has feature to custom fan curve 0% speed fans on idle (AMD cpu can't flash new bios yet)worked right out of the box-OC is so easy, +140/+250, still quiet, still cool, still <70 degrees celcius","Cons:nothing really, maybe had a cool led","Other Thoughts:has no leds on the gpu that is why its one of the cheaper cardsdon't think 1 fan can't cool this card, it cools extremely well and quiet"

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,The Best 1080P Graphics Card,2016-08-06,Pros:I have absolutely no doubt concerning the reliability and performance of any graphics card from the EVGA brand. I also liked how it came with a free poster. I love free stuff.,"Cons:Do not buy this card for 1440P or 4K Monitors. I recommend the GTX 1070 or GTX 1080. I personally expect to be using this card for the next 2 years. During that time hopefully 4K monitors, Virtual Reality, and processing power of graphics cards card will be a little more mature and affordable for mainstream use.",None

But I guess put together both cards in SLI, they maybe would outperform a GTX 1080."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, quiet, reasonably affordable",2016-08-04,"Pros:Physically short, fast, cool, quiet, efficient. Great value compared to last generation.",Cons:4gb 480 may be a little better value.,"Other Thoughts:Seems to be about 75% faster than the 960 it  replaced @1440p, allowing for max detail in Grim Dawn and not dropping below 40 fps. At factory speeds, boost runs just under 2000 MHz for me. Temperature is very good. Even after playing for extended period, temp peaks around 61C and remains very quiet. I gave it another little bump on clock speeds (60 MHz core, 800 MHz memory) and ran Unigine Valley for a while and it topped out at 68C.  For those concerned about its single fan cooling, don't be. Every site that has reviewed this card comments on how surprisingly cool it stays with a single fan. It is also (obviously) very short. If you can fit a dual slot card, this thing will fit lengthwise. I have not flashed the new BIOS for the passive cooling at low load (perhaps only idle) but it is available. This card at time of purchase did not ship with this feature.I prefer NVidia and EVGA in particular to AMD offerings. With that being said, reviews seem to bounce all over the place with the 1060s versus the 480s. Most have the 1060 ahead a little up to a more comfortable lead. Some sites have them virtually tied in performance, while none that I have read show the 480 with any meaningful lead (overall). The 4gb 480 seems to be the value leader @199 and the 8gb seems to be a tossup with the 1060 based on its slightly lower price point but also slightly lower performance (again overall). Efficiency of Pascal is well documented as being tremendously better than Polaris (AMD). If this is important to you or your psu is questionable, the 1060 really is the only consideration. I personally am very happy (excited) about the purchase and use of this card."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,quiet little card,2016-08-03,"Pros:This thing wipes the floor with my aging Radeon 6950, using much less power. 1080p gaming at max settings is a cakewalk just as advertised, and some less GPU-heavy games like Guild Wars 2 are easily playable at 1440p and 2160p.The easy BIOS update from the EVGA forums lets me spin the fan at 0 RPM. It's idling at 40c and 0 RPM in a room with no air conditioning right now. In furmark 1080p the temperature is 71c at 64% fan speed and still very quiet. Rest assured the single fan is enough to efficiently cool a GTX 1060, and splurging on a more expensive GTX 1060 with two or three fans is probably unnecessary.","Cons:I'm not a big fan of EVGA's PrecisionX OC software. EVGA wants you to sign up with personal details and give the card's serial code before installation, and MSI Afterburner is still more to my liking.","Other Thoughts:The plastic shroud on the left side of the card is too close to the clips in my old case, preventing them from snapping down to secure the card. Keep in mind my case is from 2009, and I'm also being lazy since I can rely on a thumb screw instead of the clips. I'll update when I receive a new case in the coming weeks, but I doubt this is going to affect anyone else.Update: It's a perfect fit in my Fractal Design Define Nano S. There's about 1 cm clearance between my ATX PSU and the card, but this does not seem to have had an effect on temps due to the good ventilation.Can't comment on overclocking potential just yet, as I currently have no use for it.The cable that came with mine is a 2 molex to 1 PCI 6 pin, not the one pictured by Newegg. This also doesn't affect me."

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card!,2016-08-03,"Pros:Noticeably faster than my R9 280x.  My son needed something better than the ancient HD4870 he was using and I couldn't bring myself to pay for an ""older-but-better"" card that would still work with BIOS for him.  I passed my 280x to him and grabbed this.  I had wondered if I would need to upgrade my 2.5 year old AMD FX setup in the next year, but I can say that I have no reason to do so at this point.  I run vsync because I can't stand even the slightest tearing so I'm really only judging by my system's ability to sustain 60fps@1080.  Doom, Just Cause 3, Final Fantasy 14, and a few others - all max settings and buttery where I had to turn a few things down before with my 280x (or live with some lower frame rates.)  There is one game I tried (still in alpha and under NDA so I can't specify) that I had to turn the shadows down one step from max.I have no beef with AMD and my choice of this over a 480 came to availability.  I am seeing some benches that put this a little ahead of the 480 but the pricing seems to reflect that appropriately.This is a fantastic card for the MSRP.  Don't pay gouged prices.  Wait for the stock to level out if you need to.  Unless you're doing >1080 or are serious about VR, this is the new sweet spot.",Cons:Had to replace all my mini-displayport dongles with regular displayport for my extra monitors.

Chose GTX 1060 because of the low energy and heat when sitting so many in a case side by side.  They also look outstanding with my black and silver theme.  In a lot of images the highlights look white, but they are mirrored silver.  The small form also looks great with my design because it allows some of the accents of the motherboard to shine when they would otherwise be covered.  I laugh every time I see giant and expensive versions of this GPU will full length heat sinks.  Those solutions are so far overkill,  The only goal they hit is to drain your wallet..

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Works & sounds great,2016-08-01,"Pros:Quiet & effective cooling - it's the 'old' ACX 2.0 cooling solution, but it is more than enough for this gpu. i run it 24/7 folding and it stays around 70C and at around 50% fan speed.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very good performance for incredible price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Much faster than my previous card which was a 270x. I have a 4K TV and this card connects via HDMI 4K@60Hz no problem. Can do 60fps+ at 1080p/1440p easily, some older games like Dirty 3 even run at 4K 60fps with everything maxed out. It works very well also with a more CPU intensive app like FSX/P3D, in big metro area like KLAX the CPU (i7-6700k) is now the bottleneck and having a more powerful GPU would not help much in this case.Runs super quiet, with bios update from EVGA the fan would turn off at idle which makes it perfect for HTPC usage.","Cons:No SLI support, dx12 performance still to be determined in future games.",None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Amazing card for the price,2016-08-01,"Pros:Insanely cheap card that runs better the gtx 980. Out of the box it was over clocked to 2000 mhz, after using EVGA's over clock tools on their webpage I was able to run a stable system at 2101 mhz with a memory bus of 2302 mhz. This overclocking made my computer literally 500% better when compared to my old gtx 745 4GB in the 3D marks firestrike and timespy benchmarks . It is able to handle 1080p with 60 frames a second when the settings are maxed on every game I own, some examples are Total War: Warhammer and Sniper Elite 3. The install was easy and Nvidia's GeForce Experience quickly and easily installed the drivers for the card. Altogether it took me about ten minutes to be up and running. I have not had any issues with overheating, the hottest I have had it run is 65 Celsius but that was while it was overclocked with the standard fan speed.  Normal my temperature sits somewhere around 55 Celsius when I am just playing games.","Cons:The only possible issue there could be is that it only has a 6 GB cache, right now that's more than enough but it doesn't future proof it as much as I would like.","Other Thoughts:Completely worth it, incredible price to power ratio."

It runs reasonably quiet, and is so efficient while taking up a small footprint.",Cons:No downside that I've experienced. It is an excellent card for a good price,"Other Thoughts:I've only used it on DX11 titles, not interested in any DX12 currently, but have experienced close to 1080p 60fps throughout without overclocking.

All games run 60+ fps with no issues.","Cons:I haven't found any yet. After a week of usages, I'm pretty happy","Other Thoughts:EVGA is always a stand up brand. I replaced a EVGA SC 770 4gb card with this. The 770 was given to me from a friend and is now in my wife's computer. Before she got that, she was still running my old Evga 570 Blower card. The thing still runs great to this day after countless hours and years of gaming on it. And now it's going to find a new home in the minecraft pc I am building for my nephew who is 5 years old.

EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Simply Amazing,2016-07-28,"Pros:Unbelievably quiet. The new BIOS allows 0 RPM operation but even when benchmarking on high or ultra settings it cannot be heard over CPU and case fans (which are running at low RPM settings. The performance is amazing, Without OCing it exceeded the boost speed. Never exceeded 65 Celsius. It is so small it really needs no backplate. I was worried but unless you plan to really overclock this I see no need, With Precision X I don't see why you can't get the base clock close to 2000Mhz. I play everything at 2560X1440 very smoothly (now if it would aim for me).","Cons:Could it be free? Seriously at $249 after rebate it is the best performance for the money I have ever seen in a gaming card. Combined with the low temps, quiet fan, and low power use, it is amazing.It was a little weird to have no drivers or utilities or a CD at all included and very minimal instructions. The plug and play experience was good but it replaced a NVidia card. I guess EVGA figures everyone has a nice internet connection and knows what they are doing.","Other Thoughts:I have to say the weirdest part is pulling my old but still nice EVGA GTX960 SSC out and replacing it with a card half the size that performs SOOO much better.  If you are upgrading any card at that level or below you will be very happy. Don't forget to flash the BIOS, it is painless."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Best card for the price ever released,2016-07-28,Pros:Runs extremely silent and cool and handles 3 1440p monitors no problem,Cons:Wish it had SLI,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Great card,2016-07-27,"Pros:Small, quiet and sips power. Punches above its weight in performance, maxing out most games at 1080p/60. My particular card is a capable overclocker, running at +110 core +520 mem. Build quality seems excellent, and XOC is easy use (Afterburner, etc, also work). EVGA warranty and support are a bonus.",Cons:-No SLI-Fan runs at idle (will be fixed in an update),None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Incredible value and performance,2016-07-27,Pros:- Small- Powerful,Cons:- None,"Other Thoughts:I upgraded from an EVGA gtx 660 to this EVGA gtx 1060 SC.  The performance increase is incredible, and the price can't be beat.  When they say this card delivers more than the gtx 980, they were not kidding.  Install was a breeze, I just swapped the cards out and let the NVidia control panel install the latest driver (custom install > clean install) and away I went.  About 15 minutes total time to upgrade and start gaming.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone who cannot spend $500 to buy the 1070 or 1080, and would purchase myself again in a heartbeat."
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,4,Coil WHine!,2016-07-26,"Pros:Runs great, good value video card.",Cons:Coil whine!!!,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,Very Nice!,2016-07-26,"Pros:Being only 7"" long it fit easily into my HTPC with an mATX board and has more than enough power to run the latest releases on max settings.  It was a big improvement coming from my old GTX 460. Runs quite and cool.",Cons:Have not found one yet.,None
EVGA,06G-P4-6163-KR,5,"Fast, Efficient, Cool running GPU that packs a lot of value for the money",2016-07-25,"Pros:Back Ordered this card on Tuesday's launch. It shipped on Thursday and arrived on Saturday, 3 days ahead of schedule. Once installed I fired up gpu-z to see how it was doing in idle and gaming states.One note, my AC just went out so the ambient air temp here is 95 degrees F, 35 degrees C. At the desktop, nothing else running, idle temp is 40 C. After gaming for an hour or so the temperature went to a max 61 C. For a delta of 5 C and 26 C for idle and gaming respectively on this 1060. On my old card, an HD 7850, the delta was 10 C and 30 C respectively.Boost 3.0 would allow for a stable 1950 Mhz clock while gaming in stock condition. It would idle at 253 Mhz. The fps of the 1060 was a bit more than 3x that of the HD 7850.I used a kill o watt meter to measure total system power draw with old card (HD 7850) and this one. With the HD 7850, the computer was drawing 48 watts at idle and 148 watts while playing Diablo 3. The GTX 1060 SC meausred 38 watts at idle and 88 watts while playing Diablo 3. The power draw for the 1060 while playing Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4 was 180 watts and 130 watts respectively. So this card will vary its power use depending on the games you play.My games play very smooth using this card and the card consumes a bare minimum of power and runs at very low temperatures while doing so. I think the EVGA GTX 1060 SC represents a terrific value for the money and should provide enjoyable gaming for years to come.",Cons:None that I can think of.,Other Thoughts:My Computer's specs are as follows:I7 6700K 4.0 GhzCryorig H7 UniversalGigabyte Z170 Gaming 716 GB GSKill TridentZ DDR4 3400 Mhz500 GB Samsung Evo 850 SSD Boot/Gaming480 GB OCZ 150 trion SSDCorsair HX 750WEVGA GTX 1060 SCFractal Design Define SWindow 10 Pro
