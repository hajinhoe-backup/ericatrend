5,Works right out of the box with Linux Mint 19,2019-02-03,"Pros:Installed this yesterday on my Z270A motherboard.  I had just previously updated the bios.  Put a flash drive with Linux Mint 19 install on it and all went very rapidly.  Booted into my operating system and all is well, not to mention very fast!",Cons:None,"Other Thoughts:I had seen some negative reviews from Linux users and I felt I should set the record straight, at least for my experience"
5,Very fast! Very inexpensive!,2019-01-28,Pros:Very fast. I have two running in RAID striping in my threaddripper system MB: ASUS PRIME X399-A,Cons:none,Other Thoughts:I bought heatsinks for mine.
5,"Fast, Cheap and brand name.",2019-01-23,Pros:Easy install. Super fast drive.Used standasd samsung  pro that was not sata - can't compare . Speeds are 5 times greater.,Cons:No screw to mount this on mobo in the package. Had to improvise.,Other Thoughts:I do recommend this product to everyone. Comparable to Samsund - not a whole lot of difference in speed or quality.Much cheaper as it is now though.
1,"Limited compatibility, low value tech support",2019-01-22,Pros:Fast drive,"Cons:Cost, freezes the machine when it is put to sleep mode but hibernate works fine.  Support is nearly useless as the only answer WDC support has been willing to give me is contact DELL, while DELL says contact WDC.  From WDC documentation, ""The WD Black NVMe SSD is an NVM Express™ compliant drive""  which just is not true, it is a drive that does not work with all NVMe slots.","Other Thoughts:I would not recommend, unless you have a guarantee that this is on the compatibility list.  I have found multiple machines that it should be compatible with, but it is not.  Skip this, buy from crucial, their products work."
1,Was DOA when I received it. Waiting for a replacement.,2019-02-11,Pros:Never purchased Zotac before. The price seemed great for this level of video card.,"Cons:First time purchasing Zotac brand. The card didn't work, only the fans spun. Tried 3 different cables, ports and monitors...no video.Never had problems before in my history of video card upgrades. Hope the replacement works. Looking forward to it.","Other Thoughts:If the price wasn't so good, I'd have gone with another brand but I figured I'd try them out. Zotac hasn't made much of a first impression for me."
1,Bad packaging or shipping,2019-02-07,Pros:Good price,"Cons:Ordered a bunch of these, last 4 all came with broken or fans that are pushing into heatsink and do not spin, these where on 2 different orders also so not just a single package. Packaging looks perfect so believe this is from the factory. Will see how Newegg handles this.",Other Thoughts:Have 4 more on route will update once see how handled and if next 4 have same issue and update
5,Good performer for the price,2019-02-05,"Pros:-Not the best overclocker, the guarunteed safe spot with no game minimizing is +175 on the core.-The memory can easily hit +250.-You seriously get what you pay for. No bells and whistles. It is the base 1060.-Good temps. (See cons)","Cons:-No backplate which can make the build look  not as clean.-Although you can flash the cards bios to fix this, I don't recommend. But the fans are locked at a minimum speed of 33%. This gpu is the loudest thing in my build and is actually quite annoying when at idle and I'm not wearing headphones. For reference, my case fans cannot be heard over the gpu until they hit 75%. (That's just sad).",Other Thoughts:I knew what I was buying going into this. So no eggs are taken away. This product is everything it should be for the price.
5,"Great card for the price, lots of room to overclock memory",2019-02-02,"Pros:- Great price- 6gb of GDDR5X memory , lots of room for overclocking. Only 1060 I've seen for sale with this type of memory.- Plays current games on ultra/high settings at 60fps @1080p","Cons:- None so far other than it is a plain looking card no lights or effects, but that's fine with me at this price.","Other Thoughts:I upgraded from a 1050ti and this thing blows it out of the water. I overclocked this card +450mhz on the memory and +190mhz on the GPU clock, which gave me a 4-6 fps increase from stock settings on the Unigine Supersition benchmark (1080p HIGH fps - min:32, avg: 51.61, max: 62.70) . I am now able to run PUBG on a mix of Ultra/high settings to achieve 60fps @1080p. I also tested it out on the Anthem Demo, it hovered around 50-75 fps on the High setting. The temps hover around 65c when under load, I don't have the best airflow so it would probably run cooler with some more case fans, etc. Overall very satisfied with performance."
5,Perfect!,2019-01-27,Pros:-Runs cooler than my old 750 ti!-Very easy to swap in.-AMAZING performance difference so far!,"Cons:-NONE YET with the graphics card. Been running it very hard for a couple weeks and it's been perfect.-My only somewhat complaint is the basic shipping, FedEx SmartPost kind of sucks, tracking wasn't updated for most of the time but it managed to get here the last possible day from estimated.",Other Thoughts:Switched from an old GTX 750 TI. I was worried about some sort of performance issues with my somewhat budget system. Second hand AMD FX 8350 and still on ddr3 ram. Also my system runs fairly hot so was concerned about how that would turn out. But it's been crazy good. So glad I made the switch. Well worth the price.
5,Sweet card,2019-01-26,"Pros:Works perfect, nice size card, cooler does a good job",Cons:None so far,"Other Thoughts:This card was a upgrade for me from a gtx 970 4gb, this thing is way better, it handles 4K video smoothly, I got a performance boost when editing in adobe. I plan to water cool the card for fun to see how far it can be pushed."
5,Great card for the price!,2019-01-10,"Pros:-Plays modern games at 60+ fps, with high settings and 1080P or 1440P resolution. This will vary depending on the title.-I picked this card up for 269.99 with a promo code. It also came with two free digital downloads, a Fortnite buddle and Monster Hunter: World.-The card does a good job staying cool, and is pretty quiet.",Cons:-None so far.,"Other Thoughts:-Even though this is not on sale at the moment, it is still a great value."
5,excelent product,2019-01-09,Pros:I have never been let down by zotacalways works as advertised,Cons:none,Other Thoughts:recommended over all other brands
4,1060 with 6gb GDDR5X,2019-01-05,Pros:-A fully functional 1060,Cons:-Slightly cheap looking fans,Other Thoughts:-For $200 the product was worth it.
5,Great Card for the Price with easily overclockable memory,2019-01-04,Pros:Dual Fans provide good cooling.  The cooler is actually larger than the PCB!The card is small and will fit most OEM cases.The card uses GDDR5X memory that has massive overclocking headroom.  I was able to max out msi afterburner adding 250mhz (max limit allowed by msi afterburner with no voltage adjustments).  Evidently a 450mhz overclock is achievable without messing with voltage.,Cons:The card is set to stock frequency settings out of the box for GPU and memory.   The GPU has less overclocking potential than the memory.  I could only get about 175 mhz.  This seems to be the only limiting factor.,"Other Thoughts:Out of the box this card is equal to a stock GTX 1060 with standard DDR5 memory.  If you are willing to do a simple safe overclock (no voltage adjustments), you will get a free 10 to 15% performance boost."
5,Competitive price?,2019-01-03,Pros:It works as expected. Good for small cases,Cons:Temps are not best,Other Thoughts:I have 1060 msi armor whith temps just above 50°c.This one reached 67°in games.Also i have 2070 with max 65° in games...(all different cases with different airflow inside)gddr5x doesnt have any advantage except ability to be clocked higher than gddr5. I dont want to overclock...
5,Console Killer,2019-01-02,"Pros:It runs Doom 2016 at over 100 frames very consistently and never dips below 60 frames at 1080p when paired with low tier processors, like the Ryzen R3 1200. It came with Monster Hunter World and runs that game very well. It's a good price compared to other cards in it's tier.","Cons:The ""Red Dragon"" RX 560 might be better bang-for-your-buck and it's far from the most powerful card.","Other Thoughts:I'm happy with my decision to get this. It ticked all the boxes; good price, good specs, and supported games I wanted to try. The inclusion of Monster Hunter World as part of the total package was a very nice touch. Maybe the RX560 would have been a wiser choice, your could buy two of those for a touch more than the price of one of these, but I'm very happy."
5,Had my doubts but this is a great card,2018-12-28,Pros:- Good price- Game with 2 game bundles- Easy installation,"Cons:- Not really a con, but It's a pretty big card so be sure your computer will be able to fit it in",Other Thoughts:Wasn't too sure about this since at the time of purchase there were 0 reviews but it was well worth it.
5,Good Budget Card,2018-12-26,Pros:Lower price compared to other cardsEasy to installDuel fanQuietPerformance,Cons:This isn't really a con but in the specifications the site says it requires a 500W PSU but on the box it says 400w.,Other Thoughts:It's a neat card for the price right now especially when it's packing 6gb of  GDDR5X.
5,So far so good,2018-12-26,Pros:Low costShorter cardDual fanRuns at 25C in medium loadDual DP ports,Cons:useless software packlack of light (need to see if fan spinning),"Other Thoughts:Zotac cracked into highly competitive and overly supplied video card market to make its own name, it is best to distinguished itself with some unqiue features instead of following the pack.  This shorter card with dual DP port are good start but if Zotac can make it more compact rather than focusing on head to head competition of the same kind against Gigabyte, Asus and MSI, it will make Zotac a better brand people can trust.Have a human responding 1800 service number and a friendly on line RMA web site will also boost the brand.  It is unfortunate many of these manufacturers won't understand the mere advantage when comes to consumer impression."
5,Know what to expect,2018-12-18,Pros:GDDR5X RAMRuns coolPerfect SizePerformanceOverclocking headroomPriced right to make it an easy decision,Cons:None so far,"Other Thoughts:For those who don't know, this is a cut down GTX 1080. Cut to the exact shader and Cuda core count of every other 1060. What this means: You're potentially getting an upgrade in the RAM department. I say potentially because the only way to see the benefits is to OC that RAM. Worst case scenario if you are uncomfortable overclocking is that you get a 6GB GTX 1060 with a great cooler attached.Stays cool and runs everything exactly as I need or expect it to. I plan on getting one more for my son soon."
5,Affordable,2018-12-18,Pros:the cheapeast dual fan gtx 1060 6gb you can get at the moment. performance is on par with other 1060 6gb.,Cons:none so far,Other Thoughts:the card is short but wide. it fits my rvz02 mini itx case but the gpu bracket included with the case barely fits this card.
1,Do Not Buy Zotac,2018-12-18,Pros:None,Cons:Installed the video card in to my computer.  Fans don't spin.  No picture.  Won't POST.  DOA,"Other Thoughts:I bought this video card and was super excited to see a 1060 with GDDR5X.  Never tried ZOTAC before.  Had it shipped overnight because I was so eager to get it and it doesn't work.  In the 30 years I've been building computers, I have never had a single video card come to me DOA.  Super disappointed.  I would recommend waiting for a more reputable company to offer a 1060 with GDDR5X and not buy ZOTAC."
